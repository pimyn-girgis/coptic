# Alignments

We list the modifications made to the original files in order to align them.

## New Testament

### Acts

#### Coptic Bohairic Version

- Chapter 19
  - Split verse 40 into two verses (40 and 41).
- Chapter 24
  - Part of verse 6, all of 7, and part of 8 are missing.

### John

#### Coptic Bohairic Version

- Merge 3 John 14-15 in the Coptic version.

### Revelation

#### Coptic Bohairic Version

- Chapter 12
  - Verse 18 was empty, and had no corresponding entry in NKJV, so it was deleted.

### 2 Corinthians

#### Coptic Bohairic Version

- Chapter 13
  - Split verse 13 into two verses (13 and 14).

### Isaiah

#### NKJV

- Chapter 3
  - Merge verses 21, 22, and 23.

## Old Testament

### Genesis

#### Greek version

- Chapters 31 and 32
  - In the Greek version, these two chapters had 54 and 33 verses respectively (totalling 87), while they had 55 and 32 verses respectively in the Coptic version (also totalling 87). I have moved one verse from the Greek chapter 32 to the Greek chapter 31 in order for the verse count to align with the Coptic version.
  - Note: I believe that this alignment is proper.

#### Coptic version

- Chapter 35
  - I have combined the two Coptic verses 35:(21)16 and 35:(16) into 35:16.
  - I have treated 35:(22)21 as 35:21.
  - Note: I believe verse 16 is properly aligned. You might want to take a look at verses 21 and 22.

#### English version

- Chapter 2
  - Move a verse from the beginning of chapter 3 to the end of chapter 2 (Genesis 3:1 to 2:25).
  - Move a verse from the end of chapter 36 to the beginning of chapter 37 (Genesis 36:44 to 37:1).
  - Split the last verse of Genesis 37 (Genesis 37:35 into 37:35 and 37:36).

### Exodus
