by the late Dr W.E. Crum. It is with some trepidation that I have
ventured to write a new Grammar. The need for a work in English is
pressing, but it must not be thought that this attempt to supply the
need is in the nature of an exhaustive study. Such an attempt cannot
yet be undertaken until a thorough systematic and statistical
examination of the writings of <A HREF="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Shenouda_the_Archimandrite">Shenoute</A>,
the sole outstanding native writer of Coptic, has been made....</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

very practical reason that it is the dialect which holds pride of
place in Crum's dictionary. In addition to this fact, there exists a
variety of texts in this dialect for the student to read. The
examples, all of which are actual quotations from texts, have been
drawn for the most part from the Bible. G. Zoega</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">&rsquo;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>s

myself to quoting a few examples in full, rather than giving many
references to published texts which few students ever look up. The
need for strict economy in space has compelled me to deal sketchily
with Dr. H.J. Polotsky's great discovery of the function of the

most pleasant part of my task remains. It is to express my thanks to
those who have made my work possible. First, I have to thank Prof
Jaroslav Cerny, of the University College, London, with whom I began
my Coptic Studies. His kindness and help have been unfailing, and my
debt to him is immeasurable. To Prof S.R.K. Glanville, of Cambridge,
I am equally indebted. It was at his suggestion, and with his
encouragement, that I began to compile this Grammar, and I have had
the benefit of his advice at all times. Prof Battiscombe Gunn
discussed several points of grammar with me on two occasions when I
enjoyed his hospitality at Oxford, and I need hardly add that the
result of these discussions has been the improvement of the work
generally. Finally, I have to thank my wife, who not only read
through the whole manuscript and made several valuable suggestions,
but also by her thoughtfulness and management of a very busy
household, has made the labour of writing this book infinitely easier
than I had dared to hope.</FONT></FONT></P>
