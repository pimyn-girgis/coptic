___

This repo hosts several projects for the following purpose:

- Snapshotting / archiving existing digital projects relating to the Coptic
language.

- Creating tools that make Coptic more **learnable**.

The repo contains several projects that are categorized under broad categories,
such as `bible`, `dictionary`, and `keyboard`. Each category is represented by
a directory, and subdirectories contain separate, usually unrelated projects.

## Directory Structure

- `bible/`

    This directory contains Biblical data, used to generate HTML and EPUB
    versions of the Bible and the like.

- `dictionary/`

    This directory contains dictionary data, used to generate flashcards, CSV
    files and the like.

- `keyboard/`

    This directory contains Keyboard layouts.

- `archive/`

    This directory contains snapshots of published apps or repos, utilities, and
    even some abandoned projects.
    Data retrieved from another app or repo will live here, and could be used /
    reprocessed by projects in the repo.

*TODO: Document the snapshot dates and versions of the apps and data imported
into the repo.*

*TODO: Rename "bible/" to "literature/" since all literature is welcome.*

**TODO: The following README.md files may be nested too deeply within the repo.
Consider bringing them closer to the root in order to make the information
easier to retrieve.**

- `./bible/stshenouda.org/README.md`
- `./dictionary/copticocc.org/README.md`
- `./dictionary/marcion.sourceforge.net/README.md`
- `./dictionary/marcion.sourceforge.net/data/README.md`
- `./dictionary/marcion.sourceforge.net/data/img/README.md`
- `./dictionary/stshenouda.org/data/README.md`
- `./dictionary/apps.ankiweb.net/README.md`

**TODO: Document the repo properly and invite collaborators.**

*TODO: Add unit tests.*

**TODO: Add hooks (pre-commits?) to exercise more control on the code.**

**TODO: Wrap your head around the list of projects. Rate each project based on
(1) feasibility and (2) impact. Highlight the low-hanging fruits. Revisit the
bookmarks.**
