  <h3 id="description">Description</h3>

  <p>The package includes two types of flashcard decks. While the purpose of
  the app is to help you learn vocabulary through spaced repetition, it also
  doubles as a dictionary because it's searchable.</p>

  <h4>A Coptic Dictionary</h4>

  <p>This is a essentially a <strong>complete</strong> digital version of Crum.
  The front of the card shows the <em>root</em> spellings. You can choose to
  view the front in Bohairic, Sahidic, or all dialects.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>The back of the card shows the full list of spellings per dialect, the
  meaning, and the derivations table (with prepositions, derived words, ...
  etc.) It also includes scans of the Crum pages containing the words, and
  tells you where exactly you can find the definition. This data is fully
  obtained from Crum's dictionary.</p>

        Back
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>In some cases, the back includes explanatory pictures as well. The purpose
  of the explanatory images is to aid learning by engaging your visual memory
  as well, and also to clarify the meaning when the translation is unclear (in
  many cases, you will find yourself looking up images anyway to understand the
  word, such as with exotic plant species, ancient crafts and tools, ...)
  Collecting explanatory images is an ongoing effort.</p>

  <h4>copticsite.com</h4>

  <p>This is a simple Coptic / Arabic dictionary obtained from <a href=
  "https://copticsite.com/">copticsite.com</a>. It has more than 16,000 words,
  and it includes Greek loanwords, as we as <strong>neologisms liberally added
  by the author!</strong></p>

  <p>You can download the Bible in Ebook format:</p>

  <h2 id="kindle-dictionary">Ⲇ̅. <a href=
  "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=11Ds5Zn75ITl1pFaclhvchoNrWvrLztPW">
  Kindle Dictionary</a></h2>

  <p>This is a basic Kindle dictionary that can support in-book lookups. See a
  demo below. You can download it <a href=
  "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=11Ds5Zn75ITl1pFaclhvchoNrWvrLztPW">
  here</a> .</p>

  <p>You will need to sideload the dictionary onto the E-reader device. Connect
  your Kindle to your computer with a USB cable, and copy the dictionary to the
  <em>Documents</em> folder. You then need to set the default dictionary to
  <em>A Coptic Dictionary</em> from settings, or from the reading
  interface.</p>

  <p><em>NOTE:</em> This dictionary is a mere prototype that was created on a
  whim. As you can see in the demo, it's far from perfect, and I was very
  hesitant to share it at this stage. It's not even version 1.0, it's version
  -1, so use with a grain of salt.</p>
