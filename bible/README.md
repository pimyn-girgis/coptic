    There are several published versions of the Coptic Bible. The most
    recent, and most complete, is that of [St. Shenouda the Archmandrite
    Coptic Society](stshenouda.org). It is the Coptic Bible project that is
    most worthy of investment at the moment.

    See [the directory](./stshenouda.org/) for more documentation.
