And it came to pass when Judin had read three or four leaves, he cut them off with a penknife, and cast them into the fire that was on the hearth, until the whole roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.	καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀναγινώσκοντος Ιουδιν τρεῖς σελίδας καὶ τέσσαρας, ἀπέτεµνεν αὐτὰς τῷ ξυρῷ τοῦ γραµµατέως καὶ ἔρριπτεν εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάρας, ἕως ἐξέλιπεν πᾶς ὁ χάρτης εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάρας.
