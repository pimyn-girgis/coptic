First Kings	2	2	26	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart thou quickly to Anathoth to thy farm, for thou art worthy of death this day; but I will not slay thee, because thou hast borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because thou was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.	Καὶ τῷ Αβιαθαρ τῷ ἱερεῖ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς Ἀπότρεχε σὺ εἰς Αναθωθ εἰς ἀγρόν σου, ὅτι ἀνὴρ θανάτου εἶ σὺ ἐν τῇ ἡµέρᾳ ταύτῃ, καὶ οὐ θανατώσω σε, ὅτι ἦρας τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης κυρίου ἐνώπιον τοῦ πατρός µου, καὶ ὅτι ἐκακουχήθης ἐν ἅπασιν, οἷς ἐκακουχήθη ὁ πατήρ µου.						
First Kings	2	2	27	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Selom.	καὶ ἐξέβαλεν Σαλωµων τὸν Αβιαθαρ τοῦ µὴ εἶναι ἱερέα τοῦ κυρίου, πληρωθῆναι τὸ ῥῆµα κυρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ηλι ἐν Σηλωµ. —						
First Kings	2	2	28	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.	καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἦλθεν ἕως Ιωαβ τοῦ υἱοῦ Σαρουιας (ὅτι Ιωαβ ἦν κεκλικὼς ὀπίσω Αδωνιου, καὶ ὀπίσω Σαλωµων οὐκ ἔκλινεν), καὶ ἔφυγεν Ιωαβ εἰς τὸ σκήνωµα τοῦ κυρίου καὶ κατέσχεν τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου.

And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails thee, that thou hast fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and slay him, and bury him.	καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαλωµων λέγοντες ὅτι Ἔφυγεν Ιωαβ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ ἰδοὺ κατέχει τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου. καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαλωµων πρὸς Ιωαβ λέγων Τί γέγονέν σοι, ὅτι πέφευγας εἰς τὸ θυσιαστήριον; καὶ εἶπεν Ιωαβ Ὅτι ἐφοβήθην ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ ἔφυγον πρὸς κύριον. καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Σαλωµων ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βαναιου υἱὸν Ιωδαε λέγων Πορεύου καὶ ἄνελε αὐτὸν καὶ θάψον αὐτόν.

First Kings			And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.	καὶ ἦλθεν Βαναιου υἱὸς Ιωδαε πρὸς Ιωαβ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς Ἔξελθε. καὶ εἶπεν Ιωαβ Οὐκ ἐκπορεύοµαι, ὅτι ὧδε ἀποθανοῦµαι. καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Βαναιας υἱὸς Ιωδαε καὶ εἶπεν τῷ βασιλεῖ λέγων Τάδε λελάληκεν Ιωαβ καὶ τάδε ἀποκέκριταί µοι.						
First Kings	2	2	31	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and thou shalt bury him, and thou shalt remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.	καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς Πορεύου καὶ ποίησον αὐτῷ καθὼς εἴρηκεν, καὶ ἄνελε αὐτὸν καὶ θάψεις αὐτὸν καὶ ἐξαρεῖς σήµερον τὸ αἷµα, ὃ δωρεὰν ἐξέχεεν Ιωαβ, ἀπ’ ἐµοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός µου·						
First Kings	2	2	32	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, even Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda.	καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν κύριος τὸ αἷµα τῆς ἀδικίας αὐτοῦ εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἀπήντησεν τοῖς δυσὶν ἀνθρώποις τοῖς δικαίοις καὶ ἀγαθοῖς ὑπὲρ αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥοµφαίᾳ, καὶ ὁ πατήρ µου Δαυιδ οὐκ ἔγνω τὸ αἷµα αὐτῶν, τὸν Αβεννηρ υἱὸν Νηρ ἀρχιστράτηγον Ισραηλ καὶ τὸν Αµεσσα υἱὸν Ιεθερ ἀρχιστράτηγον Ιουδα·						
First Kings	2	2	33	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06. First Kings			And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.	καὶ ἐπεστράφη τὰ αἵµατα αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς κεφαλὴν τοῦ σπέρµατος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ τῷ Δαυιδ καὶ τῷ σπέρµατι αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ θρόνῳ αὐτοῦ γένοιτο εἰρήνη ἕως αἰῶνος παρὰ κυρίου.

First Kings	2	2		OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	06.
