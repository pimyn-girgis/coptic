And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he smote them, and his armour-bearer did smite them after him.	καὶ ἀνέβη Ιωναθαν ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ µετ’ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπέβλεψαν κατὰ πρόσωπον Ιωναθαν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς, καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐπεδίδου ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ.

And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed is the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread, though all the land was dining.	καὶ Σαουλ ἠγνόησεν ἄγνοιαν µεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἡµέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ ἀρᾶται τῷ λαῷ λέγων Ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς φάγεται ἄρτον ἕως ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἐκδικήσω τὸν ἐχθρόν µου· καὶ οὐκ ἐγεύσατο πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἄρτου.
