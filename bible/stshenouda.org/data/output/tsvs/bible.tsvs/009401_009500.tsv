Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.	καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Αχιωρ ὁ ἡγούµενος πάντων υἱῶν Αµµων Ἀκουσάτω δὴ λόγον ὁ κύριός µου ἐκ στόµατος τοῦ δούλου σου, καὶ ἀναγγελῶ σοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, ὃς κατοικεῖ τὴν ὀρεινὴν ταύτην, πλησίον σοῦ οἰκοῦντος, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσεται ψεῦδος ἐκ τοῦ στόµατος τοῦ δούλου σου.						
Judith	5	05	6	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			This people are descended of the Chaldeans:	ὁ λαὸς οὗτός εἰσιν ἀπόγονοι Χαλδαίων.						
Judith	5	05	7	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.	καὶ παρῴκησαν τὸ πρότερον ἐν τῇ Μεσοποταµίᾳ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐβουλήθησαν ἀκολουθῆσαι τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, οἳ ἐγένοντο ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων·						
Judith	5	05	8	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days.	καὶ ἐξέβησαν ἐξ ὁδοῦ τῶν γονέων αὐτῶν καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, θεῷ ᾧ ἐπέγνωσαν, καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Μεσοποταµίαν καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ἡµέρας πολλάς.						
Judith	5	05	9	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.	καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς αὐτῶν ἐξελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς παροικίας αὐτῶν καὶ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Χανααν, καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ ἐν κτήνεσιν πολλοῖς σφόδρα.						
Judith	5	05	10	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.	καὶ κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐκάλυψεν γὰρ τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς Χανααν λιµός, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ µέχρις οὗ διετράφησαν· καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐκεῖ εἰς πλῆθος πολύ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθµὸς τοῦ γένους αὐτῶν.						
Judith	5	05	11	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, and made them slaves.	καὶ ἐπανέστη αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου καὶ κατεσοφίσατο αὐτοὺς ἐν πόνῳ καὶ πλίνθῳ, ἐταπείνωσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτοὺς εἰς δούλους.						
Judith	5	05	12	OT	1. OT	Historical Books	2. Historical Books	02. Historical Books	13. Judith			Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.	καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου πληγαῖς, ἐν αἷς οὐκ ἦν ἴασις· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν.
