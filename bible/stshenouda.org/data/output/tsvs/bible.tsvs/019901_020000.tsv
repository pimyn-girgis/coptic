And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.	οὐκ ἐπεστρέφοντο ἐν τῷ βαδίζειν αὐτά, ἕκαστον κατέναντι τοῦ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο.

And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.	καὶ ὁµοίωσις τῶν προσώπων αὐτῶν· πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου καὶ πρόσωπον λέοντος ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν καὶ πρόσωπον µόσχου ἐξ ἀριστερῶν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν καὶ πρόσωπον ἀετοῦ τοῖς τέσσαρσιν.

And the four had their wings spread out above; each one had two joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.	καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν ἐκτεταµέναι ἄνωθεν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν, ἑκατέρῳ δύο συνεζευγµέναι πρὸς ἀλλήλας, καὶ δύο ἐπεκάλυπτον ἐπάνω τοῦ σώµατος αὐτῶν.

And each one went straight forward: wherever the spirit was going they went, and turned not back.	καὶ ἑκάτερον κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπορεύετο· οὗ ἂν ἦν τὸ πνεῦµα πορευόµενον, ἐπορεύοντο καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον.

And in the midst of the living creatures there was an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning.	καὶ ἐν µέσῳ τῶν ζῴων ὅρασις ὡς ἀνθράκων πυρὸς καιοµένων, ὡς ὄψις λαµπάδων συστρεφοµένων ἀνὰ µέσον τῶν ζῴων καὶ φέγγος τοῦ πυρός, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐξεπορεύετο ἀστραπή.
