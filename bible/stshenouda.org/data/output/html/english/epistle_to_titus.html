  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I. Paul, (the) servant of God,
  (the) apostle of Jesus Christ according to (the) faith of the elect of God,
  and (the) knowledge of the truth, according to [the] godliness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span>&nbsp;in a hope of an eternal life, this which God,
  who cannot lie, promised before the eternal times; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> but he manifested in his times his word in a
  proclaiming, this with which I was intrusted, according to the commandment of
  God our saviour; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> to Titos my beloved
  child according to the fellowship of (the) faith: (the) grace and (the) peace
  from God (the) Father and Christ Jesus our saviour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore I left thee in Krithē, that thou
  mightest set up the things which were left, and establish presbyters in every
  city, according as I commanded thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  one who is irreproachable being husband of one wife, having children
  faithful, and they are not under (lit. in) an accusation of dissoluteness, or
  being insubordinate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For it is right
  that the bishop should be irreproachable, as a steward of God, not being
  selfwilled, not being a man of anger, not being a winebibber, not being a
  striker, not being a lover of dishonourable gain, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> being a lover of strangers, lover of the good
  (singular), prudent, just, holy, being temperate, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> laying hold on the faithful word for the teaching,
  that he may be able to encourage in the sound teaching and reprove them who
  contradict. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>&nbsp;For there are many
  insubordinate and speakers of vanity, deceivers of heart, chiefly they of
  (the) circumcision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> These whose
  mouths ought to be stopped, who turn aside (the) whole of houses, teaching
  the things which (they) ought not, for a despicable gain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But one from them said, a prophet of theirs: 'The
  Krētēs, sayers of falsehood always, they are evil beasts, they are idle
  bellies.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> This witness is true.
  Because of this reason reprove them severely, that they may be sound in (the)
  faith, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and not attend to Jewish
  fables, and commandments of man, turning them from (the) truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For all things are pure to them who are pure, but
  they who are defiled and the unbelieving, there is not anything pure to them,
  but their heart was defiled and their conscience. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They confess God, that they know him; but in
  their works they deny him, abominable, dissentient, unserviceable about all
  good works.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_titus2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But thou, speak the things which
  are comely for the sound doctrine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The
  old men to be watchful, being grave, prudent, sound in (the) faith, in [the]
  love, in [the] patience. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thus also the
  old women, to be in [a] character reverent, not slanderers, nor enslaved to
  much wine, being givers of good teaching; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that they may teach the young women to be lovers
  (of their) husbands, lovers (of their) children, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> prudent, chaste, the managers of their house,
  good, being in subjection to their husbands, that the word of God may not be
  blasphemed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thus also the young men
  encourage to be prudent: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> making
  thyself (a) pattern of good works in all things (lit. work); in the doctrine,
  with (lit. in) [the] uncorruptness, (speaking) a grave word, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> a sound word, uncondemnable; that he who is
  contrary to us may be ashamed, having not any evil to say against us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The servants to be subject to their
  masters, pleasing them in all things, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  and not to be thieves, but manifesting all good fidelity (lit. faith), that
  they may adorn the teaching of God our saviour in all things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For (the) grace of God our saviour was manifested
  to every man, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> instructing us that,
  having denied [the] ungodliness and [the] worldly lusts, we might live in [a]
  prudence and [a] righteousness and [a] godliness in this present age.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Looking out forward to the blessed
  hope, and (the) manifestation of (the) glory of God, the great (one), Christ
  Jesus our saviour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He who gave
  himself for us, until he saved us from all lawlessness, and purified us to
  him for a people, permanent, and zealous of good works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Speak these things, and encourage, reprove in all
  authority. Let not any lay hold on thee in [a] knowledge.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_titus3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Remind them to be subject to the
  rulers and the authorities, well pleasing, and be prepared for all good
  works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> That they blaspheme not any
  one, and be not disputers, being fair, manifesting all meekness with all men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For we also were being ignorant once,
  being dissentient, and going astray, enslaved to lusts and pleasures of many
  kinds, walking in [a] malice and [an] envy, worthy of being hated, hating one
  another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But when was manifested the
  kindness and the love toward man of God our saviour, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> not from our works which we did in [a]
  righteousness, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of
  the regeneration and the renewing, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  this which he poured upon us richly through Jesus Christ our saviour;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that we might be justified in the
  grace of that one, and become heirs according to a hope of an eternal life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Faithful is (the) word, and concerning
  these [other] things I wish to cause thee to assure thyself, that they who
  believed God should take care to maintain the good works. These (things) are
  good and they are profitable to [the] men: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but [the] questions of foolishness, and [the]
  genealogies, and [the] strifes, and [the] disputes about the law avoid; for
  these (things) are unprofitable and they are vain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> An heretical man, after once and twice
  admonishing him, refuse; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> knowing that
  such a man is turned (away) and sinneth, having condemned himself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If we should send Artema to thee, or
  Tichikos, haste thee to come to me to Nikopolis: for I ordained to spend the
  winter there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Zēnas the lawyer and
  Apollō send in [a] haste, that they may not be deficient of anything.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Let those who are ours learn to take
  care for good works unto the necessary needs, that they may not be
  unfruitful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> All who are with me
  salute thee. Salute them who love us in (the) faith. (The) grace with you
  all.</p>
