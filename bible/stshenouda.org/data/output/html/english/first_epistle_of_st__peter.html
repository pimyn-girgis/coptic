  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._peter1">1</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Peter, (the) apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect
  who are in (the) foreign (land) among the dispersion of Pontos, (the)
  Galatia, (the) Kappodokia, [the] Asia and [the] Bēthania, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in
  the sanctification of the spirit, unto a redemption and a sprinkling of (the)
  blood of Jesus Christ our Lord: (The) grace and the peace shall be multiplied
  to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Blessed is God and the Father
  of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to (the) abundance of his mercy begat
  us into a hope of life through (the) rising of Jesus Christ from them who are
  dead, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> into an inheritance
  incorruptible and unpolluted and unfading: Kept for you in the heavens,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> namely they who are watched over in
  [a] power of God through (the) faith unto a salvation prepared, about to be
  revealed in the last times; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> that in
  which ye will be glad for a little (while) now: If it is right that ye should
  be grieved in temptations of many kinds; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that (the) choiceness of your faith may be more
  precious than the gold which will perish, but being proved through [a] fire;
  that ye may be found in [a] praise and [a] glory and [an] honour in the
  revelation of Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Him whom
  ye know not, ye love; him now ye see not, but ye believe him. Be glad in an
  unspeakable joy which was glorified: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  receiving (the) end of your faith, (the) salvation of your souls.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For concerning this salvation the
  prophets sought; and they searched, they who prophesied of the grace which
  was in you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> searching after the time
  which the spirit of Christ spake in them, (they) having witnessed before of
  the pains of Christ, and the glories which come after these (things):
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> they to whom it was revealed, that
  they were doing it not for themselves, but they were ministering them to you,
  these things which were now shown to you through them who preached good
  tidings to you in a holy spirit sent from (the) heaven; the things which
  there are angels desiring to see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Therefore, girding yourselves upon the loins of your heart, watching
  perfectly, hope for the grace which will be brought to you in the revelation
  of Jesus Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> as children of (the)
  obedience. Not conforming yourselves to (lit. in) the former lusts which ye
  were doing in an ignorance: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but as he
  who called you is holy, be ye also holy in all (your) walk (of life);
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>&nbsp;for it is written: 'Be ye holy;
  because I also am holy.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if him,
  who will judge without respect of persons each one according to his works, ye
  are to call Our Father,' walk in the time of your sojourn in [a] fear
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Knowing that ye were not redeemed in
  [a] gold and [a] silver, which will corrupt, from your vain walk, which your
  fathers delivered to you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> but ye were
  redeemed through a precious blood, as (of) a lamb without spot and without
  stain, Christ, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> foreknown indeed from
  (the) foundation of the world, but manifested unto (the) last of the times
  because of you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> who believe God
  through him who raised him from them who are dead, and he glorified him, so
  that your faith and your hope may be in God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Having purified your soul in (the) obedience of
  the truth into an unfeigned love of brethren in a pure heart, love one
  another perseveringly; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> having been
  born not of a sowing, which will corrupt, but in an incorruption through the
  word of God, who liveth and who abideth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Because all flesh was (plur.) as [a] grass, and
  all its glory was as a flower of [a] grass. The grass dried, and its flower
  fell away; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> but the word of the Lord
  abideth for ever. But this is the word which was proclaimed among you.
  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._peter2">2</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Having laid down all malice, and all subtlety, and
  all hypocrisy, and all envy, and malice all slander, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> as young children lately born, yearn after the
  milk reasonable and without subtlety, that ye may grow in it into [the]
  salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> If ye tasted that the Lord
  is kind: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> to whom ye come, the living
  stone, rejected indeed by [the] men, but he is chosen with God, and he is
  precious: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and ye also are as living
  stones, building yourselves a spiritual house, for a holy priesthood, for
  (the) offering spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Because it is written in the
  Scripture: Lo, I shall (lit. will) lay in Sian a chosen stone, as head of
  corner: and he who believeth him shall not be ashamed.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The preciousness then was to you, namely they who
  believe. But (to) the unbelievers indeed (pron.) the stone which they who
  build rejected, this became a head of corner, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence--
  they who will stumble at the word, not consenting to that in which they were
  also placed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But ye are a chosen race,
  a kingdom, a priesthood, a holy nation, a people justified, that ye might
  manifest the virtues of him who called you from (the) darkness into his
  light, which is wonderful: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> who were
  not a people once, but now ye become a people of God; they who were not to
  have mercy shown to them, but now mercy was shown to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> My beloved, I pray you as sojourners and
  strangers, avoid the fleshly lusts which are armed against the soul.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let your walk (of life) be
  serviceable among the Gentiles, that if they spoke against you as evil doers,
  judging (lit. seeing) from your good works they may glorify God in (the) day
  of [the] visitation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Be subject to
  every creation of human origin because of the Lord: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> whether (the) king as exalted, or the governors
  as sent through him, for a taking vengeance on the evil doers, but for a
  praise of good doers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because this is
  (the) wish of God: to do the good; that ye may shut out (e2pett) (the)
  ignorance of the senseless men: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> as
  free; and having the freedom, Not as a covering of [the] malice, but as
  servants of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Honour all. Love the
  love of brethren. Fear God. Honour (the) king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> [The] servants being subject to your masters in
  all fear; not only the good (and) equitable, but also the others who are
  perverse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For this is acceptable,
  [but] if because of [a] conscience of God there is one (who) will undergo
  griefs, wrong being done to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For
  what is the praise, if ye commit sin, and being buffeted, ye are
  longsuffering? But (if) doing the good and suffering ye endure, [for] this is
  acceptable with God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for ye were
  called to this. Because Christ also suffered for us, he left to us an
  example, that we might walk after his footsteps: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> he who committed not sin, nor was subtlety found
  in his mouth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> being reviled, he was
  not reviling; suffering, he was not being angry; but he was giving himself to
  the judgement of the true judge: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> he
  who bare up our sins upon the tree through his body, that we, having died
  from [the] sins, might live to [the] righteousness. He through whose wound ye
  were healed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For ye were being as
  sheep going astray, but ye return now to your shepherd and (the) bishop of
  your souls.
  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._peter3">3</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus also [it is] the women being subject to their
  husbands; if there are some who consent not to the word, through the walk (of
  life) of the women that they may be gained without word; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> seeing your walk (of life) chaste in [a] fear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Among these let not the ornament be
  (that) which is outward, of the broideries of plaiting of the hair (plur.),
  and the broideries of gold, or in a wearing of adorned raiment; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but the man which is hidden in the heart, in the
  incorruptibility of the spirit which is tranquil and meek, that which is
  before God of many kinds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For thus it
  was once with the holy women, they were hoping in God, they were adorning
  themselves, being subject to their husbands: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> [for] as Sarra, obeying Abraam, calling him my
  lord,' she whose daughters ye were, doing the good, and not fearing any fear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thus also [the] husbands, dwelling
  with them, knowing that the women are a weak vessel, honouring them, as being
  fellow-heirs with you of the grace of (the) life of many kinds, that ye be
  not hindered in your prayers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  finally, being all of one thought, being fellow-sufferers, being of brotherly
  love, tenderhearted, being humble: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and
  not giving an evil for an evil, nor a reviling for a reviling, but that which
  is contrary, blessing; because ye were called unto this thing, that ye might
  inherit the blessing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For he who
  wisheth to love [a] life, and to see good days, let him refrain his tongue
  from the evil, and his lips, not to speak [a] subtlety. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let him turn aside from the evil: let him do the
  good; let him seek for [a] peace, and pursue it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Because (the) eyes of the Lord look upon the
  righteous, and his ears incline to their prayer; but (the) face of the Lord
  (is) against them who do the evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And who will be able to give pain to you, if ye should be zealous of the
  good? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if ye even suffer for [the]
  righteousness, blessed are ye. But their fear, fear it not, nor be troubled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the Lord Christ sanctify him in
  your hearts. Being prepared always for [a] defence to all who will ask you a
  word concerning the hope which is in you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but in [a] meekness and [a] fear: having a good
  conscience; that they may be ashamed who speak against you as evil doers, and
  who calumniate your good walk in Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For it is good that ye should do the good, If the
  will of God wisheth, and ye should suffer, than doing the evil, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Because Christ also died once because of (the)
  sin for us, [but] the righteous for the wicked, that he might bring us in to
  God. Having died indeed in (the) flesh, but he liveth in the spirit;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> in this he went, he preached good
  tidings to the spirits also who were in the prison; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> they who were disobedient once, when, the
  longsuffering of God was indulgent in the days of Nōe, who made an ark,
  through which (a) few were saved from the water, that is to say, eight souls.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thus ye also now, he will save you in
  a soulstype of a baptism, not a laying down of a filthiness of (the) flesh,
  but in a good. conscience for (the) praying to God, through (the)
  resurrection of Jesus Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> who is
  on the right hand of God, having gone to (the) heaven: angels and authorities
  and powers were subjected to him.
  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._peter4">4</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Christ then having suffered in (the) flesh for us,
  [and] ye also arm yourselves in this form; because he who suffered in (the)
  flesh recovered himself from (the) sin; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> so as not to remain any more in lusts of man, but
  to spend (the) rest of his life in (the) flesh in (the) wish of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the time which was passed was
  sufficient for you doing (the) wish of the Gentiles, walking in pollutions
  and lusts, and drunkennesses of many kinds, and revellings and defilements
  and many profane idolatries: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that is
  to say, they who think it strange that ye run not with them into the same
  effusion of [the] dissoluteness, blaspheming: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> they who will give account to him who is prepared
  to judge them who are alive and them who are dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For therefore were good tidings preached also to
  the dead, that they indeed might be judged according to [the] men in (the)
  flesh, but might live according to God in the spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But (the) end of all things drew near: be
  understanding then, and watch in the prayers: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but first of all things let [the] love be
  continuous in you one to another, because [the] love covereth over many sins.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Be hospitable one towards another,
  without murmuring: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> each one (of you)
  according to the grace which he received, ministering in it among yourselves,
  as good stewards of the grace of God of many kinds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He who will speak, as words of God: he who will
  minister, as from a power which God will prepare: that in all things God may
  be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory unto age of all the
  ages. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> my beloved, think it not
  strange in the burning which will happen among you for a trial to you, as a
  strange thing which befell you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  as being fellow-sufferers of Christ rejoice, that in the revelation also of
  his glory ye may rejoice in [a] gladness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if ye are reproached in (the) name of the
  Lord, blessed are ye, because (the spirit ) of the glory and the power and
  the spirit of God rested itself upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But let not one of you suffer either as a
  murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a looker after that which
  is not his: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but if as Christian, let
  him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because it is (the) time for the judgement to
  begin from (the) house of God: if it was to begin from us first, then what is
  (the) end of them who are disobedient to the Gospel of God? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> If the righteous scarcely will be saved, then
  where appeared the sinner and godless? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Wherefore let them who suffer according to the
  wish of God commit their souls unto God the faithful creator in (the) doing
  the good.
  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._peter5">5</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The presbyters who are among you, I beseech you, I
  your fellow presbyter, and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and sharer of
  the glory which will be revealed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Tend
  the flock which is among you of God, taking their visitation not in [a]
  violence, but in a wish of heart according to God, nor in [a] greediness, but
  in [a] readiness of heart; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> nor that ye
  are being lords over the heritages, but be examples to the flock.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if the chief shepherd should
  appear ye will receive the unfading crown of (the) glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus, [the] young men, be subject to the old men.
  But all of you clothe yourselves with humility of heart towards one another:
  because God opposeth the proud; he giveth [a] grace to the humble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Humiliate yourselves under the mighty
  hand of God, that he may exalt you in (the) time of the visitation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Cast all your care on him; because he
  careth for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Be watchful and be
  sober; because your enemy the devil walketh as a lion, roaring, seeking to
  swallow up (some) one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> That one ye
  shall resist, being firm in the faith, knowing these very troubles: the
  completion of these (is) for your brethren who are in the world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But God of all grace, who called you into his
  eternal glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, he (pron.) shall
  perfect you, and he shall establish you, he shall encourage you, he shall lay
  foundation for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> His is the
  strength and the glory forever. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  I wrote to you through Silouanos, our faithful brother, as I think in few
  (words) encouraging, witnessing that this is the grace of God in [a] truth,
  this in which ye stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Saluteth you
  the fellow-chosen (fem.) who is in Babylōn, and Markos my son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Salute one another in a kiss of [the] love. (The)
  peace to you all who are in Christ.
