  But the Levites of the tribe of their family were not counted among the

  furniture, and over all things that are in it; and they shall do service in
  it, and they shall encamp round about the tabernacle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And in removing the tabernacle, the Levites shall
  take it down, and in pitching the tabernacle they shall set it up: and let

  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And the children of Israel shall encamp, every
  man in his own order, and every man according to his company, with their
  host. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> But let the Levites encamp
  round about the tabernacle of witness fronting it, and so there shall be no
  sin among the children of Israel; and the Levites themselves shall keep the
  guard of the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span>
  And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses
  and Aaron, so did they.

  tabernacle of witness shall be set forward, and the camp of the Levites shall
  be between the camps; as they shall encamp, so also shall they commence their
  march, each one next in order to his fellow according to their companies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The station of the camp of Ephraim

  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But the Levites were not numbered with them, as
  the Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the
  children of Israel did all things that the Lord commanded Moses; thus they
  encamped in their order, and thus they began their march in succession each
  according to their divisions, according to the houses of their families.
  <h3 id="numbers3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these are
  the generations of Aaron and Moses, in the day in which the Lord spoke to
  Moses in mount Sina. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And these are the
  names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the first-born; and Abiud, Eleazar and
  Ithamar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> These are the names of the
  sons of Aaron, the anointed priests whom they consecrated to the priesthood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Nadab and Abiud died before the
  Lord, when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of
  Sina; and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the
  priests’ office with Aaron their father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Take the tribe of Levi, and thou shalt set them
  before Aaron the priest, and they shall minister to him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and shall keep his charges, and the charges of the
  children of Israel, before the tabernacle of witness, to do the works of the
  tabernacle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they shall keep all
  the furniture of the tabernacle of witness, and the charges of the children
  of Israel as to all the works of the tabernacle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And thou shalt give the Levites to Aaron, and to
  his sons the priests; they are given for a gift to me of the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt appoint Aaron
  and his sons over the tabernacle of witness; and they shall keep their charge
  of priesthood, and all things belonging to the altar, and within the veil;
  and the stranger that touches them shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Behold, I have taken the Levites from the midst
  of the children of Israel, instead of every male that opens the womb from
  among the children of Israel: they shall be their ransom, and the Levites
  shall be mine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For every first-born
  is mine; in the day in which I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt, I
  sanctified to myself every first-born in Israel: both of man and beast, they
  shall be mine: I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the
  Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sina, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Take the number of the sons of Levi, according to
  the houses of their families, according to their divisions; number ye them
  every male from a month old and upwards. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Moses and Aaron numbered them by the word of
  the Lord, as the Lord commanded them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gedson, Caath, and Merari.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And these are the names of the sons
  of Gedson according to their families; Lobeni and Semei: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and the sons of Caath according to their
  families; Amram and Issaar, Chebron and Oziel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and the sons of Merari according to their
  families, Mooli and Musi; these are the families of the Levites according to
  the houses of their families. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> To
  Gedson belongs the family of Lobeni, and the family of Semei: these are the
  families of Gedson. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The numbering of
  them according to the number of every male from a month old and upwards,
  their numbering was seven thousand and five hundred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the sons of Gedson shall encamp westward
  behind the tabernacle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the ruler
  of the household of the family of Gedson was Elisaph the son of Dael.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the charge of the sons of Gedson
  in the tabernacle of witness was the tent and the veil, and the covering of
  the door of the tabernacle of witness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and the curtains of the court, and the veil of
  the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and the remainder of all
  its works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> To Caath belonged one
  division, that of Amram, and another division, that of Issaar, and another
  division, that of Chebron, and another division, that of Oziel: these are the
  divisions of Caath, according to number. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Every male from a month old and upward, eight
  thousand and six hundred, keeping the charges of the holy things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> The families of the sons of Caath,
  shall encamp beside the tabernacle toward the south. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the chief of the house of the families of the
  divisions of Caath, was Elisaphan the son of Oziel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And their charge was the ark, and the table, and
  the candlestick, and the altars, and all the vessels of the sanctuary
  wherewith they do holy service, and the veil, and all their works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the chief over the chief of the
  Levites, was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, appointed to keep the
  charges of the holy things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> To Merari
  belonged the family of Mooli, and the family of Musi: these are the families
  of Merari. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> The mustering of them
  according to number, every male from a month old and upwards, was six
  thousand and fifty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the head of
  the house of the families of the division of Merari, was Suriel the son of
  Abichail: they shall encamp by the side of the tabernacle northwards.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> The oversight of the charge of the
  sons of Merari included the chapiters of the tabernacle, and its bars, and
  its pillars, and its sockets, and all their furniture, and their works,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and the pillars of the court round
  about, and their bases, and their pins, and their cords. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> They that encamp before the tabernacle of witness
  on the east shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charges of the
  sanctuary according to the charges of the children of Israel; and the
  stranger that touches them, shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> All the numbering of the Levites, whom Moses and
  Aaron numbered by the word of the Lord, according to their families, every
  male from a month old and upwards, were two and twenty thousand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Count every
  first-born male of the children of Israel from a month old and upwards, and
  take the number by name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And thou
  shalt take the Levites for me—I am the Lord—instead of all the first-born of
  the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the
  first-born among the cattle of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And Moses counted, as the Lord commanded him,
  every first-born among the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And all the male first-born in number by name,
  from a month old and upwards, were according to their numbering twenty-two
  thousand and two hundred and seventy-three. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Take the Levites instead of all the first-born of
  the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle,
  and the Levites shall be mine; I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And for the ransoms of the two hundred and
  seventy-three which exceed the Levites in number of the first-born of the
  sons of Israel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> thou shalt even take
  five shekels a head; thou shalt take them according to the holy didrachm,
  twenty oboli to the shekel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And thou
  shalt give the money to Aaron and to his sons, the ransom of those who exceed
  in number among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And Moses took
  the silver, the ransom of those that exceeded in number the redemption of the
  Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> He took the silver from the
  first-born of the sons of Israel, a thousand three hundred and sixty-five
  shekels, according to the holy shekel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Moses gave the ransom of them that were over
  to Aaron and his sons, by the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
  <h3 id="numbers4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Take
  the sum of the children of Caath from the midst of the sons of Levi, after
  their families, according to the houses of their fathers’ households;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> from twenty-five years old and upward
  until fifty years, every one that goes in to minister, to do all the works in
  the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And these
  are the works of the sons of Caath in the tabernacle of witness; it is most
  holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Aaron and his sons shall go
  in, when the camp is about to move, and shall take down the shadowing veil,
  and shall cover with it the ark of the testimony. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they shall put on it a cover, even a blue
  skin, and put on it above a garment all of blue, and shall put the staves
  through the rings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they shall put
  on the table set forth for shew-bred a cloth all of purple, and the dishes,
  and the censers, and the cups, and the vessels with which one offers
  drink-offerings; and the continual loaves shall be upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they shall put upon it a scarlet cloth, and
  they shall cover it with a blue covering of skin, and they shall put the
  staves into it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they shall take a
  blue covering, and cover the candlestick that gives light, and its lamps, and
  its snuffers, and its funnels, and all the vessels of oil with which they
  minister. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they shall put it, and
  all its vessels, into a blue skin cover; and they shall put it on bearers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they shall put a blue cloth for a
  cover on the golden altar, and shall cover it with a blue skin cover, and put
  in its staves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they shall take
  all the instruments of service, with which they minister in the sanctuary:
  and shall place them in a cloth of blue, and shall cover them with blue skin
  covering, and put them upon staves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And he shall put the covering on the altar, and they shall cover it with a
  cloth all of purple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they shall
  put upon it all the vessels with which they minister upon it, and the
  fire-pans, and the flesh-hooks, and the cups, and the cover, and all the
  vessels of the altar; and they shall put on it a blue cover of skins, and
  shall put in its staves; and they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the
  laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a blue cover of skin, and put
  it on bars. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Aaron and his sons
  shall finish covering the holy things, and all the holy vessels, when the
  camp begins to move; and afterwards the sons of Caath shall go in to take up
  the furniture; but shall not touch the holy things, lest they die: these
  shall the sons of Caath bear in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is
  overseer—the oil of the light, and the incense of composition, and the daily
  meat-offering and the anointing oil, are his charge; even the oversight of
  the whole tabernacle, and all things that are in it in the holy place, in all
  the works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the Lord spoke to
  Moses and Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Ye shall not
  destroy the family of Caath from the tribe out of the midst of the Levites.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This do ye to them, and they shall
  live and not die, when they approach the holy of holies: Let Aaron and his
  sons advance, and they shall place them each in his post for bearing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And so they shall by no means go in
  to look suddenly upon the holy things, and die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Take the sum of the children of Gedson, and these
  according to the houses of their lineage, according to their families.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Take the number of them from five and
  twenty years old and upwards until the age of fifty, every one that goes in
  to minister, to do his business in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> This is the public service of the family of
  Gedson, to minister and to bear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  they shall bear the skins of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of witness,
  and its veil, and the blue cover that was on it above, and the cover of the
  door of the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  And all the curtains of the court which were upon the tabernacle of witness,
  and the appendages, and all the vessels of service that they minister with
  they shall attend to. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> According to
  the direction of Aaron and his sons shall be the ministry of the sons of
  Gedson, in all their ministries, and in all their works; and thou shalt take
  account of them by name in all things borne by them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> This is the service of the sons of Gedson in the
  tabernacle of witness, and their charge by the hand of Ithamar the son of
  Aaron the priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> The sons of Merari
  according to their families, according to the houses of their lineage, take
  ye the number of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Take the
  number of them from five and twenty years old and upwards until fifty years
  old, every one that goes in to perform the services of the tabernacle of
  witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And these are the charges of
  the things borne by them according to all their works in the tabernacle of
  witness: they shall bear the chapiters of the tabernacle, and the bars, and
  its pillars, and its sockets, and the veil, and there shall be their sockets,
  and their pillars, and the curtain of the door of the tabernacle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they shall bear the pillars of
  the court round about, and there shall be their sockets, and they shall bear
  the pillars of the veil of the door of the court, and their sockets and their
  pins, and their cords, and all their furniture, and all their instruments of
  service: take ye their number by name, and all the articles of the charge of
  the things borne by them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> This is the
  ministration of the family of the sons of Merari in all their works in the
  tabernacle of witness, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Moses and Aaron and the rulers of
  Israel took the number of the sons of Caath according to their families,
  according to the houses of their lineage; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> from five and twenty years old and upwards to the
  age of fifty years, every one that goes in to minister and do service in the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the
  numbering of them according to their families was two thousand, seven hundred
  and fifty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> This is the numbering of
  the family of Caath, every one that ministers in the tabernacle of witness,
  as Moses and Aaron numbered them by the word of the Lord, by the hand of
  Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the sons of Gedson were
  numbered according to their families, according to the houses of their
  lineage, <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> from five and twenty years
  old and upward till fifty years old, every one that goes in to minister and
  to do the services in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And the numbering of them according to their
  families, according to the houses of their lineage, was two thousand six
  hundred and thirty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> This is the
  numbering of the family of the sons of Gedson, every one who ministers in the
  tabernacle of witness; whom Moses and Aaron numbered by the word of the Lord,
  by the hand of Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And also the
  family of the sons of Merari were numbered according to their divisions,
  according to the house of their fathers; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> from five and twenty years old and upward till
  fifty years old, every one that goes in to minister in the services of the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the
  numbering of them according to their families, according to the houses of
  their lineage, was three thousand and two hundred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> This is the numbering of the family of the sons
  of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by the word of the Lord, by the hand
  of Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> All that were numbered,
  whom Moses and Aaron and the rulers of Israel numbered, namely, the Levites,
  according to their families and according to the houses of their lineage,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> from five and twenty years old and
  upward till fifty years old, every one that goes in to the service of the
  works, and the charge of the things that are carried in the tabernacle of
  witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And they that were numbered
  were eight thousand five hundred and eighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> He reviewed them by the word of the Lord by the
  hand of Moses, appointing each man severally over their respective work, and
  over their burdens; and they were numbered, as the Lord commanded Moses.
  <h3 id="numbers5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Charge the
  children of Israel, and let them send forth out of the camp every leper, and
  every one who has in issue of the reins, and every one who is unclean from a
  dead body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Whether male or female,
  send them forth out of the camp; and they shall not defile their camps in
  which I dwell among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the
  children of Israel did so, and sent them out of the camp: as the Lord said to
  Moses, so did the children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Every man or woman who shall commit
  any sin that is common to man, or if that soul shall in anywise have
  neglected the commandment and transgressed; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that person shall confess the sin which he has
  committed, and shall make satisfaction for his trespass: he shall pay the
  principal, and shall add to it the fifth part, and shall make restoration to
  him against whom he has trespassed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  But if a man have no near kinsman, so as to make satisfaction for his
  trespass to him, the trespass-offering paid to the Lord shall be for the
  priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which he shall make atonement with
  it for him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And every first-fruits in
  all the sanctified things among the children of Israel, whatsoever they shall
  offer to the Lord, shall be for the priest himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the hallowed things of every man shall be
  his; and whatever man shall give any thing to the priest, the gift shall be
  his. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Speak to the children of
  Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whosesoever wife shall transgress against
  him, and slight and despise him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and
  supposing any one shall lie with her carnally, and the thing shall be hid
  from the eyes of her husband, and she should conceal it and be herself
  defiled, and there be no witness with her, and she should not be taken;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and there should come upon him a
  spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled;
  or there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous
  of his wife, and she should not be defiled; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> then shall the man bring his wife to the priest,
  and shall bring his gift for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal:
  he shall not pour oil upon it, neither shall he put frankincense upon it; for
  it is a sacrifice of jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, recalling sin to
  remembrance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the priest shall
  bring her, and cause her to stand before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the priest shall take pure running water in
  an earthen vessel, and he shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the
  tabernacle of witness, and the priest having taken it shall cast it into the
  water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the priest shall cause the
  woman to stand before the Lord, and shall uncover the head of the woman, and
  shall put into her hands the sacrifice of memorial, the sacrifice of
  jealousy; and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of this conviction
  that brings the curse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the priest
  shall adjure her, and shall say to the woman, If no one has lain with thee,
  and if thou hast not transgressed so as to be polluted, being under the power
  of thy husband, be free from this water of the conviction that causes the
  curse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But if being a married woman
  thou hast transgressed, or been polluted, and any one has lain with thee,
  beside thy husband: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> then the priest
  shall adjure the woman by the oaths of this curse, and the priest shall say
  to the woman, The Lord bring thee into a curse and under an oath in the midst
  of thy people, in that the Lord should cause thy thigh to rot and thy belly
  to swell; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and this water bringing the
  curse shall enter into thy womb to cause thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to
  rot. And the woman shall say, So be it, So be it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the priest shall write these curses in a
  book, and shall blot them out with the water of the conviction that brings
  the curse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he shall cause the
  woman to drink the water of the conviction that brings the curse; and the
  water of the conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the priest shall take from the
  hand of the woman the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall present the sacrifice
  before the Lord, and shall bring it to the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the priest shall take a handful of the
  sacrifice as a memorial of it, and shall offer it up upon the altar; and
  afterwards he shall cause the woman to drink the water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and
  have altogether escaped the notice of her husband, then the water of the
  conviction that brings the curse shall enter into her; and she shall swell in
  her belly, and her thigh shall rot, and the woman shall be for a curse in the
  midst of her people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if the woman
  have not been polluted, and be clean, then shall she be guiltless and shall
  conceive seed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> This is the law of
  jealousy, wherein a married woman should happen to transgress, and be
  defiled; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> or in the case of a man on
  whomsoever the spirit of jealousy should come, and he should be jealous of
  his wife, and he should place his wife before the Lord, and the priest shall
  execute towards her all this law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Then the man shall be clear from sin, and that woman shall bear her sin.
  <h3 id="numbers6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> speak to the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever man or woman shall
  specially vow a vow to separate oneself with purity to the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> he shall purely abstain from wine and strong
  drink; and he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink; and
  whatever is made of the grape he shall not drink; neither shall he eat fresh
  grapes or raisins, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> all the days of his
  vow: he shall eat no one of all the things that come from the vine, wine from
  the grape-stones to the husk, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> all the
  days of his separation:—a razor shall not come upon his head, until the days
  be fulfilled which he vowed to the Lord: he shall be holy, cherishing the
  long hair of the head, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> all the days of
  his vow to the Lord: he shall not come nigh to any dead body, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> to his father or his mother, or to his brother or
  his sister; he shall not defile himself for them, when they have died,
  because the vow of God is upon him on his head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> All the days of his vow he shall be holy to the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if any one should die
  suddenly by him, immediately the head of his vow shall be defiled; and he
  shall shave his head in whatever day he shall be purified: on the seventh day
  he shall be shaved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And on the eighth
  day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to
  the doors of the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the priest shall offer one for a
  sin-offering; and the other for a whole-burnt-offering; and the priest shall
  make atonement for him in the things wherein he sinned respecting the dead
  body, and he shall sanctify his head in that day, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> in which he was consecrated to the Lord, all the
  days of his vow; and he shall bring a lamb of a year old for a
  trespass-offering; and the former days shall not be reckoned, because the
  head of his vow was polluted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  this is the law of him that has vowed: in whatever day he shall have
  fulfilled the days of his vow, he shall himself bring his gift to the doors
  of the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he
  shall bring his gift to the Lord; one he-lamb of a year old without blemish
  for a whole-burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of a year old without blemish
  for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and a basket of unleavened bread of
  fine flour, even loaves kneaded with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with
  oil, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the priest shall bring them before the Lord,
  and shall offer his sin-offering, and his whole-burnt-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of
  peace-offering to the Lord with the basket of unleavened bread; and the
  priest shall offer its meat-offering and its drink-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he that has vowed shall shave the head of his
  consecration by the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and shall put the
  hairs on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the priest shall take the sodden
  shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened loaf from the basket, and one
  unleavened cake, and shall put them on the hands of the votary after he has
  shaved off his holy hair. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  priest shall present them as an offering before the Lord; it shall be the
  holy portion for the priest beside the breast of the heave-offering and
  beside the shoulder of the wave-offering: and afterwards the votary shall
  drink wine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> This is the law of the
  votary who shall have vowed to the Lord his gift to the Lord, concerning his
  vow, besides what he may be able to afford according to the value of his vow,
  which he may have vowed according to the law of separation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus ye
  shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The Lord bless thee and keep thee; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and
  have mercy upon thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> the Lord lift
  up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they shall put my name upon the children of
  Israel, and I the Lord will bless them.
  <h3 id="numbers7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to
  pass in the day in which Moses finished the setting-up of the tabernacle,
  that he anointed it, and consecrated it, and all its furniture, and the altar
  and all its furniture, he even anointed them, and consecrated them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the princes of Israel brought
  gifts, twelve princes of their fathers’ houses: these were the heads of
  tribes, these are they that presided over the numbering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they brought their gift before the Lord, six
  covered waggons, and twelve oxen; a waggon from two princes, and a calf from
  each: and they brought them before the tabernacle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Take of them, and they shall be for the works of
  the services of the tabernacle of witness: and thou shalt give them to the
  Levites, to each one according to his ministration. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses took the waggons and the oxen, and gave
  them to the Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he gave two
  waggons and four oxen to the sons of Gedson, according to their
  ministrations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And four waggons and
  eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari according to their ministrations, by
  Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  But to the sons of Caath he gave them not, because they have the
  ministrations of the sacred things: they shall bear them on their shoulders.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the rulers brought gifts for the
  dedication of the altar, in the day in which he anointed it, and the rulers
  brought their gifts before the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And the Lord said to Moses, One chief each day, they shall offer their gifts
  a chief each day for the dedication of the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he that offered his gift on the first day,
  was Naasson the son of Aminadab, prince of the tribe of Juda. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he brought his gift, one silver charger of a
  hundred and thirty shekels was its weight, one silver bowl, of seventy
  shekels according to the holy shekel; both full of fine flour kneaded with
  oil for a meat-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> One golden
  censer of ten shekels full of incense. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> One calf of the herd, one ram, one he-lamb of a
  year old for a whole-burnt-offering; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And for a sacrifice of peace-offering, two
  heifers, five rams, five he goats, five ewe-lambs of a year old: this was the
  gift of Naasson the son of Aminadab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  On the second day Nathanael son of Sogar, the prince of the tribe of
  Issachar, brought his offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  he brought his gift, one silver charger, its weight a hundred and thirty
  shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels according to the holy shekel;
  both full of fine flour kneaded with oil for a meat-offering. <span style=

  shekels, and each bowl of seventy shekels: all the silver of the vessels was

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(86)</span> Twelve golden censers full of
  incense: all the gold of the shekels, a hundred and twenty shekels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(87)</span> All the cattle for
  whole-burnt-offerings, twelve calves, twelve rams, twelve he-lambs of a year

  cattle for a sacrifice of peace-offering, twenty-four heifers, sixty rams,
  sixty he-goats of a year old, sixty ewe-lambs of a year old without blemish:
  this is the dedication of the altar, after that Moses consecrated Aaron, and
  after he anointed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(89)</span> When Moses
  went into the tabernacle of witness to speak to God, then he heard the voice
  of the Lord speaking to him from off the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark of
  the testimony, between the two cherubs; and he spoke to him.
  <h3 id="numbers8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to
  Aaron, and thou shalt say to him, Whenever thou shalt set the lamps in order,
  the seven lamps shall give light opposite the candlestick. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Aaron did so: on one side opposite the
  candlestick he lighted its lamps, as the Lord appointed Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And this is the construction of the candlestick:
  it is solid, golden—its stem, and its lilies—all solid: according to the
  pattern which the Lord shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Take the Levites out of the midst of the children
  of Israel, and thou shalt purify them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And thus shalt thou perform their purification: thou shalt sprinkle them with
  water of purification, and a razor shall come upon the whole of their body,
  and they shall wash their garments, and shall be clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they shall take one calf of the herd, and its
  meat-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: and thou shalt take a calf of a
  year old of the herd for a sin-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
  tabernacle of witness; and thou shalt assemble all the congregation of the
  sons of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt bring
  the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands
  upon the Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Aaron shall
  separate the Levites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Israel:
  and they shall be prepared to perform the works of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Levites shall lay their hands on the
  heads of the calves; and thou shalt offer one for a sin-offering, and the
  other for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou shalt set the Levites before
  the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons; and thou shalt give them as
  a gift before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thou
  shalt separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they
  shall be mine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And afterwards the
  Levites shall go in to perform the works of the tabernacle of witness; and
  thou shalt purify them, and present them before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For these are given to me for a present out of
  the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of
  all the first-born of the sons of Israel that open every womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For every first-born among the children of Israel
  is mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I smote every
  first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I took the Levites in the place of every
  first-born among the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to
  Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the
  service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make
  atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons
  of Israel to draw nigh to the holy things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of
  the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses
  concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So the Levites purified themselves and washed
  their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron
  made atonement for them to purify them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And afterwards the Levites went in to minister in
  their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons;
  as the Lord appointed Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> This is the ordinance for the
  Levites; From five and twenty years old and upward, they shall go in to
  minister in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And from fifty years old the Levites shall cease
  from the ministry, and shall not work any longer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And his brother shall serve in the tabernacle of
  witness to keep charges, but he shall not do works: so shalt thou do to the
  Levites in their charges.
  <h3 id="numbers9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sina in the second year after they had
  gone forth from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak, and let the children of Israel keep the
  passover in its season. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> On the
  fourteenth day of the first month at even, thou shalt keep it in its season;
  thou shalt keep it according to its law, and according to its ordinance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moses ordered the children of
  Israel to sacrifice the passover, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> on
  the fourteenth day of the first month in the wilderness of Sina, as the Lord
  appointed Moses, so the children of Israel did. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And there came men who were unclean by reason of a
  dead body, and they were not able to keep the passover on that day; and they
  came before Moses and Aaron on that day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And those men said to Moses, We are unclean by
  reason of the dead body of a man: shall we therefore fail to offer the gift
  to the Lord in its season in the midst of the children of Israel?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Moses said to them, stand there,
  and I will hear what charge the Lord will give concerning you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whatever
  man shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or on a journey far off, among
  you, or among your posterity; he shall then keep the passover to the Lord,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> in the second month, on the
  fourteenth day; in the evening they shall offer it, with unleavened bread and
  bitter herbs shall they eat it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They
  shall not leave of it until the morrow, and they shall not break a bone of
  it; they shall sacrifice it according to the ordinance of the passover.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And whatsoever man shall be clean,
  and is not far off on a journey, and shall fail to keep the passover, that
  soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has not offered the gift to
  the Lord in its season: that man shall bear his iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if there should come to you a stranger in
  your land, and should keep the passover to the Lord, he shall keep it
  according to the law of the passover and according to its ordinance: there
  shall be one law for you, both for the stranger, and for the native of the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And in the day in which the
  tabernacle was pitched the cloud covered the tabernacle, the place of the
  testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as the appearance
  of fire till the morning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> So it was
  continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by
  night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And when the cloud went up
  from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel departed; and in
  whatever place the cloud rested, there the children of Israel encamped.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The children of Israel shall encamp
  by the command of the Lord, and by the command of the Lord they shall remove:
  all the days in which the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of
  Israel shall encamp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And whenever the
  cloud shall be drawn over the tabernacle for many days, then the children of
  Israel shall keep the charge of God, and they shall not remove. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it shall be, whenever the cloud overshadows
  the tabernacle a number of days, they shall encamp by the word of the Lord,
  and shall remove by the command of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it shall come to pass, whenever the cloud
  shall remain from the evening till the morning, and in the morning the cloud
  shall go up, then shall they remove by day or by night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> When the cloud continues a full month
  overshadowing the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp, and shall
  not depart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For they shall depart by
  the command of the Lord:—they kept the charge of the Lord by the command of
  the Lord by the hand of Moses.
  <h3 id="numbers10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Make to
  thyself two silver trumpets: thou shalt make them of beaten work; and they
  shall be to thee for the purpose of calling the assembly, and of removing the
  camps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt sound with them,
  and all the congregation shall be gathered to the door of the tabernacle of
  witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if they shall sound with
  one, all the rulers even the princes of Israel shall come to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And ye shall sound an alarm, and the
  camps pitched eastward shall begin to move. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall sound a second alarm, and the camps
  pitched southward shall move; and ye shall sound a third alarm, and the camps
  pitched westward shall move forward; and ye shall sound a fourth alarm, and
  they that encamp toward the north shall move forward: they shall sound an
  alarm at their departure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And whenever
  ye shall gather the assembly, ye shall sound, but not an alarm. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the priests the sons of Aaron shall sound with
  the trumpets; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for you throughout your
  generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if ye shall go forth
  to war in your land against your enemies that are opposed to you, then shall
  ye sound with the trumpets; and ye shall be had in remembrance before the
  Lord, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And in the days of your gladness, and in your
  feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall sound with the trumpets at your
  whole-burnt-offerings, and at the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and
  there shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it came to pass in the second
  year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud went
  up from the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And the children of Israel set forward with their baggage in the wilderness
  of Sina; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Pharan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the first rank departed by the word of the
  Lord by the hand of Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they
  first set in motion the order of the camp of the children of Juda with their
  host; and over their host was Naasson, son of Aminadab. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And over the host of the tribe of the sons of
  Issachar, was Nathanael son of Sogar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zabulon, was Eliab the son of
  Chaelon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they shall take down the
  tabernacle, and the sons of Gedson shall set forward, and the sons of Merari,
  who bear the tabernacle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the
  order of the camp of Ruben set forward with their host; and over their host
  was Elisur the son of Sediur. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  over the host of the tribe of the sons of Symeon, was Salamiel son of
  Surisadai. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And over the host of the
  tribe of the children of Gad, was Elisaph the son of Raguel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the sons of Caath shall set forward bearing
  the holy things, and the others shall set up the tabernacle until they
  arrive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the order of the camp of
  Ephraim shall set forward with their forces; and over their forces was
  Elisama the son of Semiud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And over
  the forces of the tribes of the sons of Manasse, was Gamaliel the son of
  Phadassur. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And over the forces of the
  tribe of the children of Benjamin, was Abidan the son of Gadeoni.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the order of the camp of the sons
  of Dan shall set forward the last of all the camps, with their forces: and
  over their forces was Achiezer the son of Amisadai. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And over the forces of the tribe of the sons of
  Aser, was Phageel the son of Echran. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And over the forces of the tribe of the sons of Nephthali, was Achire the son
  of Ænan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> These are the armies of the
  children of Israel; and they set forward with their forces. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Moses said to Obab the son of Raguel the
  Madianite, the father-in-law of Moses, We are going forward to the place
  concerning which the Lord said, This will I give to you: Come with us, and we
  will do thee good, for the Lord has spoken good concerning Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he said to him, I will not go,
  but I will go to my land and to my kindred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said, Leave us not, because thou hast been
  with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And it shall come to pass if thou wilt go with
  us, it shall even come to pass that in whatsoever things the Lord shall do us
  good, we will also do thee good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And
  they departed from the mount of the Lord a three days’ journey; and the ark
  of the covenant of the Lord went before them a three days’ journey to provide
  rest for them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the cloud
  overshadowed them by day, when they departed from the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And it came to pass when the ark set forward,
  that Moses said, Arise, O Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered: let all
  that hate thee flee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And in the
  resting he said, Turn again, O Lord, the thousands and tens of thousands in
  Israel.
  <h3 id="numbers11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  people murmured sinfully before the Lord; and the Lord heard them and was
  very angry; and fire was kindled among them from the Lord, and devoured a
  part of the camp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the people cried
  to Moses: and Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was quenched.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the name of that place was called
  Burning; for a fire was kindled among them from the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the mixed multitude among them lusted
  exceedingly; and they and the children of Israel sat down and wept and said,
  Who shall give us flesh to eat? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> We
  remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt freely; and the cucumbers, and the
  melons, and the leeks, and the garlic, and the onions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But now our soul is dried up; our eyes turn to
  nothing but to the manna. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  manna is as coriander seed, and the appearance of it the appearance of
  hoar-frost. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the people went
  through the field, and gathered, and ground it in the mill, or pounded it in
  a mortar, and baked it in a pan, and made cakes of it; and the sweetness of
  it was as the taste of wafer made with oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And when the dew came upon the camp by night, the
  manna came down upon it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Moses
  heard them weeping by their families, every one in his door: and the Lord was
  very angry; and the thing was evil in the sight of Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Moses said to the Lord, Why hast thou
  afflicted thy servant, and why have I not found grace in thy sight, that thou
  shouldest lay the weight of this people upon me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Have I conceived all this people, or have I born
  them? that thou sayest to me, Take them into thy bosom, as a nurse would take
  her suckling, into the land which thou swarest to their fathers? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Whence have I flesh to give to all this people?
  for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I shall not be able to bear this people alone,
  for this thing is too heavy for me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And if thou doest thus to me, slay me utterly, if I have found favour with
  thee, that I may not see my affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Gather me seventy men
  from the elders of Israel, whom thou thyself knowest that they are the elders
  of the people, and their scribes; and thou shalt bring them to the tabernacle
  of witness, and they shall stand there with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will go down, and speak there with thee;
  and I will take of the spirit that is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
  and they shall bear together with thee the burden of the people, and thou
  shalt not bear them alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And to the
  people thou shalt say, Purify yourselves for the morrow, and ye shall eat
  flesh; for ye wept before the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
  for it was well with us in Egypt: and the Lord shall allow you to eat flesh,
  and ye shall eat flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Ye shall not
  eat one day, nor two, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> ye shall eat for a full month, until
  the flesh come out at your nostrils; and it shall be nausea to you, because
  ye disobeyed the Lord, who is among you, and wept before him, saying, What
  had we to do to come out of Egypt? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And Moses said, The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen;
  and thou saidst, I will give them flesh to eat, and they shall eat a whole
  month. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Shall sheep and oxen be slain
  for them, and shall it suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be
  gathered together for them, and shall it suffice them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Shall not the hand of
  the Lord be fully sufficient? now shalt thou know whether my word shall come
  to pass to thee or not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Moses
  went out, and spoke the words of the Lord to the people; and he gathered
  seventy men of the elders of the people, and he set them round about the
  tabernacle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the Lord came down in
  a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put
  it upon the seventy men that were elders; and when the spirit rested upon
  them, they prophesied and ceased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  there were two men left in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the
  name of the other Modad; and the spirit rested upon them, and these were of
  the number of them that were enrolled, but they did not come to the
  tabernacle; and they prophesied in the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And a young man ran and told Moses, and spoke,
  saying, Eldad and Modad prophesy in the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Joshua the son of Naue, who attended on
  Moses, the chosen one, said, My lord Moses, forbid them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Moses said to him, Art thou jealous on my
  account? and would that all the Lord’s people were prophets; whenever the
  Lord shall put his spirit upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And Moses departed into the camp, himself and the elders of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And there went forth a wind from the
  Lord, and brought quails over from the sea; and it brought them down upon the
  camp a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on that side, round
  about the camp, as it were two cubits from the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the people rose up all the day, and all the
  night, and all the next day, and gathered quails; he that gathered least,
  gathered ten measures; and they refreshed themselves round about the camp.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The flesh was yet between their
  teeth, before it failed, when the Lord was wroth with the people, and the
  Lord smote the people with a very great plague. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the name of that place was called the Graves
  of Lust; for there they buried the people that lusted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> The people departed from the Graves of Lust to
  Aseroth; and the people halted at Aseroth.
  <h3 id="numbers12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Mariam
  and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman whom Moses
  took; for he had taken an Ethiopian woman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they said, Has the Lord spoken to Moses only?
  has he not also spoken to us? and the Lord heard it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the man Moses was very meek beyond all the men
  that were upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord
  said immediately to Moses and Aaron and Mariam, Come forth all three of you
  to the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the
  three came forth to the tabernacle of witness; and the Lord descended in a
  pillar of a cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of witness; and
  Aaron and Mariam were called; and both came forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to them, Hear my words: If there
  should be of you a prophet to the Lord, I will be made known to him in a
  vision, and in sleep will I speak to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all
  my house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I will speak to him mouth to
  mouth apparently, and not in dark speeches; and he has seen the glory of the
  Lord; and why were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the great anger of the Lord was
  upon them, and he departed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the
  cloud departed from the tabernacle; and, behold, Mariam was leprous, white as
  snow; and Aaron looked upon Mariam, and, behold, she was leprous.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Aaron said to Moses, I beseech
  thee, my lord, do not lay sin upon us, for we were ignorant wherein we
  sinned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let her not be as it were
  like death, as an abortion coming out of his mother’s womb, when the disease
  devours the half of the flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  Moses cried to the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech thee, heal her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, If her
  father had only spit in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? let
  her be set apart seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall come
  in. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Mariam was separated without
  the camp seven days; and the people moved not forward till Mariam was
  cleansed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13:1)</span> And afterwards the people
  set forth from Aseroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Pharan.
  <h3 id="numbers13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Send for thee
  men, and let them spy the land of the Chananites, which I give to the sons of
  Israel for a possession; one man for a tribe, thou shalt send them away
  according to their families, every one of them a prince. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moses sent them out of the wilderness of
  Pharan by the word of the Lord; all these were the princes of the sons of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And these are their names: of
  the tribe of Ruben, Samuel the son of Zachur. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Of the tribe of Symeon, Saphat the son of Suri.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Of the tribe of Judah, Chaleb the son
  of Jephonne. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Of the tribe of Issachar,
  Ilaal the son of Joseph. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Of the tribe
  of Ephraim, Ause the son of Naue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Of
  the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Of the tribe of Zabulon, Gudiel the son of Sudi.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Of the tribe of Joseph of the sons of
  Manasse, Gaddi the son of Susi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Of
  the tribe of Dan, Amiel the son of Gamali. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Of the tribe of Aser, Sathur the son of Michael.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Of the tribe of Nephthali, Nabi the
  son of Sabi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Of the tribe of Gad,
  Gudiel the son of Macchi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These are
  the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses called
  Ause the son of Naue, Joshua. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  Moses sent them to spy out the land of Chanaan, and said to them, Go up by
  this wilderness; and ye shall go up to the mountain, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and ye shall see the land, what it is, and the
  people that dwells on it, whether it is strong or weak, or whether they are
  few or many. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And what the land is on
  which they dwell, whether it is good or bad; and what the cities are wherein
  these dwell, whether they dwell in walled cities or unwalled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And what the land is, whether rich or poor;
  whether there are trees in it or no: and ye shall persevere and take of the
  fruits of the land: and the days were the days of spring, the forerunners of
  the grape. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they went up and
  surveyed the land from the wilderness of Sin to Rhoob, as men go in to Æmath.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they went up by the wilderness,
  and departed as far as Chebron; and there was Achiman, and Sessi, and
  Thelami, the progeny of Enach. Now Chebron was built seven years before Tanin
  of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they came to the valley
  of the cluster and surveyed it; and they cut down thence a bough and one
  cluster of grapes upon it, and bore it on staves, and they took of the
  pomegranates and the figs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they
  called that place, The valley of the cluster, because of the cluster which
  the children of Israel cut down from thence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they returned from thence, having surveyed
  the land, after forty days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they
  proceeded and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the
  children of Israel, to the wilderness of Pharan Cades; and they brought word
  to them and to all the congregation, and they shewed the fruit of the land:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and they reported to him, and said,
  We came into the land into which thou sentest us, a land flowing with milk
  and honey; and this is the fruit of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Only the nation that dwells upon it is bold, and
  they have very great and strong walled towns, and we saw there the children
  of Enach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Amalec dwells in the
  land toward the south: and the Chettite and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and
  the Amorite dwells in the hill country: and the Chananite dwells by the sea,
  and by the river Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Chaleb
  stayed the people from speaking before Moses, and said to him, Nay, but we
  will go up by all means, and will inherit it, for we shall surely prevail
  against them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But the men that went
  up together with him said, We will not go up, for we shall not by any means
  be able to go up against the nation, for it is much stronger than we.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they brought a horror of that
  land which they surveyed upon the children of Israel, saying, The land which
  we passed by to survey it, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all
  the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary stature. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And there we saw the giants; and we were before
  them as locusts, yea even so were we before them.
  <h3 id="numbers14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And all the
  congregation lifted up their voice and cried; and the people wept all that
  night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And all the children of Israel
  murmured against Moses and Aaron; and all the congregation said to them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Would we had died in the land of
  Egypt! or in this wilderness, would we had died! and why does the Lord bring
  us into this land to fall in war? our wives and our children shall be for a
  prey: now then it is better to return into Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they said one to another, Let us make a ruler,
  and return into Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Moses and
  Aaron fell upon their face before all the congregation of the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But Joshua the son of Naue,
  and Chaleb the son of Jephonne, of the number of them that spied out the
  land, rent their garments, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and spoke
  to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we
  surveyed is indeed extremely good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If
  the Lord choose us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land
  which flows with milk and honey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Only
  depart not from the Lord; and fear ye not the people of the land, for they
  are meat for us; for the season of prosperity is departed from them, but the
  Lord is among us: fear them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  all the congregation bade stone them with stones; and the glory of the Lord
  appeared in the cloud on the tabernacle of witness to all the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord said to Moses,
  How long does this people provoke me? and how long do they refuse to believe
  me for all the signs which I have wrought among them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I will smite them with death, and destroy them;
  and I will make of thee and of thy father’s house a great nation, and much
  greater than this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Moses said to
  the Lord, So Egypt shall hear, for thou hast brought up this people from them
  by thy might. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Moreover all the
  dwellers upon this land have heard that thou art Lord in the midst of this
  people, who, O Lord, art seen by them face to face, and thy cloud rests upon
  them, and thou goest before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night
  in a pillar of fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if thou
  shalt destroy this nation as one man; then all the nations that have heard
  thy name shall speak, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because
  the Lord could not bring this people into the land which he sware to them, he
  has overthrown them in the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And now, O Lord, let thy strength be exalted, as
  thou spakest, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Lord is
  long-suffering and merciful, and true, removing transgressions and iniquities
  and sins, and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the sins of the
  fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Forgive this people their sin according to thy
  great mercy, as thou wast favourable to them from Egypt until now.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, I am
  gracious to them according to thy word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But as I live and my name is living, so the glory
  of the Lord shall fill all the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  For all the men who see my glory, and the signs which I wrought in Egypt, and
  in the wilderness, and have tempted me this tenth time, and have not
  hearkened to my voice, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> surely they
  shall not see the land, which I sware to their fathers; but their children
  which are with me here, as many as know not good or evil, every inexperienced
  youth, to them will I give the land; but none who have provoked me shall see
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But my servant Chaleb, because
  there was another spirit in him, and he followed me, I will bring him into
  the land into which he entered, and his seed shall inherit it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Amalec and the Chananite dwell in the valley:
  to-morrow turn and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and
  Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> How long shall I
  endure this wicked congregation? I have heard their murmurings against me,
  even the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they have murmured
  concerning you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Say to them, As I
  live, saith the Lord: surely as ye spoke into my ears, so will I do to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Your carcases shall fall in this
  wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that
  were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> ye shall not enter into the land for
  which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb
  the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the son of Naue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And your little ones, who ye said should be a
  prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land, which
  ye rejected. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And your carcases shall
  fall in this wilderness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And your
  sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your
  fornication, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> According to the number of the days during which
  ye spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, ye shall bear your sins
  forty years, and ye shall know my fierce anger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I the Lord have spoken, Surely will I do thus to
  this evil congregation that has risen up together against me: in this
  wilderness they shall be utterly consumed, and there they shall die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the men whom Moses sent to spy
  out the land, and who came and murmured against it to the assembly so as to
  bring out evil words concerning the land, — <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> the men that spoke evil reports against the land,
  even died of the plague before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of
  Jephonne still lived of those men that went to spy out the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Moses spoke these words to all the children
  of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they rose early in the morning and went up to
  the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we that are here will go up to the
  place of which the Lord has spoken, because we have sinned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Moses said, Why do ye transgress the word of
  the Lord? ye shall not prosper. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Go
  not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall ye fall before the face of
  your enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> For Amalec and the
  Chananite are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye
  have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And having forced their passage, they
  went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord
  and Moses stirred not out of the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Amalec and the Chananite that dwelt in that
  mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them unto Herman; and they
  returned to the camp.
  <h3 id="numbers15">15</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye are come into the
  land of your habitation, which I give to you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and thou wilt offer whole-burnt-offerings to the
  Lord, a whole-burnt-offering or a meat-offering to perform a vow, or a
  free-will offering, or to offer in your feasts a sacrifice of sweet savour to
  the Lord, whether of the herd or the flock: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> then he that offers his gift to the Lord shall
  bring a meat-offering of fine flour, a tenth part of an ephah mingled with
  oil, even with the fourth part of a hin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And for a drink-offering ye shall offer the fourth
  part of a hin on the whole-burnt-offering, or on the meat-offering: for every
  lamb thou shalt offer so much, as a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And for a ram, when ye offer it
  as a whole-burnt-offering or as a sacrifice, thou shalt prepare as a
  meat-offering two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, the third part of a
  hin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And ye shall offer for a smell of
  sweet savour to the Lord wine for a drink-offering, the third part of a hin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if ye sacrifice a bullock from the
  herd for a whole-burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, to perform a vow or a
  peace-offering to the Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then the
  worshipper shall offer upon the calf a meat-offering, three tenth deals of
  fine flour mingled with oil, even the half of a hin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And wine for a drink-offering the half of a hin,
  a sacrifice for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thus shalt thou do to one calf or to one ram, or
  to one lamb of the sheep or kid of the goats. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> According to the number of what ye shall offer,
  so shall ye do to each one, according to their number. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Every native of the country shall do thus to
  offer such things as sacrifices for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if there should be a stranger
  among you in your land, or one who should be born to you among your
  generations, and he will offer a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the
  Lord—as ye do, so the whole congregation shall offer to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> There shall be one law for you and
  for the strangers abiding among you, a perpetual law for your generations: as
  ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> There shall be one law and one ordinance for you,
  and for the stranger that abides among you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Speak to the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say
  to them, When ye are entering into the land, into which I bring you,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> then it shall come to pass, when ye
  shall eat of the bread of the land, ye shall separate a wave-offering, a
  special offering to the Lord, the first-fruits of your dough. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Ye shall offer your bread a heave-offering: as a
  heave-offering from the threshing-floor, so shall ye separate it,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> even the first-fruits of your dough,
  and ye shall give the Lord a heave-offering throughout your generations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But whensoever ye shall transgress,
  and not perform all these commands, which the Lord spoke to Moses;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> as the Lord appointed you by the hand
  of Moses, from the day which the Lord appointed you and forward throughout
  your generations, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> then it shall come
  to pass, if a trespass be committed unwillingly, unknown to the congregation,
  then shall all the congregation offer a calf of the herd without blemish for
  a whole-burnt-offering of sweet savour to the Lord, and its meat-offering and
  its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a
  sin-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the priest shall
  make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the
  trespass shall be forgiven them, because it is involuntary; and they have
  brought their gift, a burnt-offering to the Lord for their trespass before
  the Lord, even for their involuntary sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And it shall be forgiven as respects all the
  congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that is abiding
  among you, because it is involuntary to all the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if one soul sin unwillingly, he shall bring
  one she-goat of a year old for a sin-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the priest shall make atonement for the soul
  that committed the trespass unwillingly, and that sinned unwillingly before
  the Lord, to make atonement for him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  There shall be one law for the native among the children of Israel, and for
  the stranger that abides among them, whosoever shall commit a trespass
  unwillingly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And whatever soul either
  of the natives or of the strangers shall do any thing with a presumptuous
  hand, he will provoke God; that soul shall be cut off from his people,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> for he has set at nought the word of
  the Lord and broken his commands: that soul shall be utterly destroyed, his
  sin is upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the children of
  Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering sticks on the
  sabbath-day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they who found him
  gathering sticks on the sabbath-day brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to
  all the congregation of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they placed him in custody, for they did not
  determine what they should do to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man be by all means put to
  death: do ye all the congregation, stone him with stones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And all the congregation brought him forth out of
  the camp; and all the congregation stoned him with stones outside the camp,
  as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the
  Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Speak to
  the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them; and let them make for
  themselves fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their
  generations: and ye shall put upon the fringes of the borders a lace of blue.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And it shall be on your fringes, and
  ye shall look on them, and ye shall remember all the commands of the Lord,
  and do them: and ye shall not turn back after your imaginations, and after
  the sight of your eyes in the things after which ye go a whoring;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> that ye may remember and perform all
  my commands, and ye shall be holy unto your God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> I am the Lord your God that brought you out of
  the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.
  <h3 id="numbers16">16</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Core the
  son of Isaar the son of Caath the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron, sons of
  Eliab, and Aun the son of Phaleth the son of Ruben, spoke; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and rose up before Moses, and two hundred and
  fifty men of the sons of Israel, chiefs of the assembly, chosen councillors,
  and men of renown. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They rose up
  against Moses and Aaron, and said, Let it be enough for you that all the
  congregation are holy, and the Lord is among them; and why do ye set up
  yourselves against the congregation of the Lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he spoke to Core and all his
  assembly, saying, God has visited and known those that are his and who are
  holy, and has brought them to himself; and whom he has chosen for himself, he
  has brought to himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This do ye:
  take to yourselves censers, Core and all his company; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and put fire on them, and put incense on them
  before the Lord to-morrow; and it shall come to pass that the man whom the
  Lord has chosen, he shall be holy: let it be enough for you, ye sons of Levi.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Moses said to Core, Hearken to me,
  ye sons of Levi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Is it a little thing
  for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of
  Israel, and brought you near to himself to minister in the services of the
  tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the tabernacle to minister for
  them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he has brought thee near
  and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee, and do ye seek to be priests
  also? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thus it is with thee and all
  thy congregation which is gathered together against God: and who is Aaron,
  that ye murmur against him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Moses
  sent to call Dathan and Abiron sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not go
  up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Is it a little thing that thou
  hast brought us up to a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the
  wilderness, and that thou altogether rulest over us? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou art a prince, and hast thou brought us into
  a land flowing with milk and honey, and hast thou given us an inheritance of
  land and vineyards? wouldest thou have put out the eyes of those men? we will
  not go up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Moses was exceeding
  indignant, and said to the Lord, Do thou take no heed to their sacrifice: I
  have not taken away the desire of any one of them, neither have I hurt any
  one of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Moses said to Core,
  Sanctify thy company, and be ready before the Lord, thou and Aaron and they,
  to-morrow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And take each man his
  censer, and ye shall put incense upon them, and shall bring each one his
  censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty censers, and thou and Aaron
  shall bring each his censer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And each
  man took his censer, and they put on them fire, and laid incense on them; and
  Moses and Aaron stood by the doors of the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Core raised up against them all his company
  by the door of the tabernacle of witness; and the glory of the Lord appeared
  to all the congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Separate your selves from the midst of this congregation, and I will consume
  them at once. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they fell on their
  faces, and said, O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, if one man has
  sinned, shall the wrath of the Lord be upon the whole congregation?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Speak to the congregation, saying,
  Depart from the company of Core round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiron,
  and all the elders of Israel went with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he spoke to the congregation, saying,
  Separate yourselves from the tents of these stubborn men, and touch nothing
  that belongs to them, lest ye be consumed with them in all their sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they stood aloof from the tent of
  Core round about; and Dathan and Abiron went forth and stood by the doors of
  their tents, and their wives and their children and their store. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Moses said, Hereby shall ye know that the
  Lord has sent me to perform all these works, that I have not done them of
  myself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> If these men shall die
  according to the death of all men, if also their visitation shall be
  according to the visitation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But if the Lord shall shew by a
  wonder, and the earth shall open her mouth and swallow them up, and their
  houses, and their tents, and all that belongs to them, and they shall go down
  alive into Hades, then ye shall know that these men have provoked the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And when he ceased speaking all these
  words, the ground clave asunder beneath them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the ground opened, and swallowed them up, and
  their houses, and all the men that were with Core, and their cattle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they went down and all that they
  had, alive into Hades; and the ground covered them, and they perished from
  the midst of the congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And
  all Israel round about them fled from the sound of them, for they said, Lest
  the earth swallow us up also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And
  fire went forth from the Lord, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men
  that offered incense.
  <h3 id="numbers17">17</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(16:36)</span> And the
  Lord said to Moses, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:37)</span> and to Eleazar
  the son of Aaron the priest, Take up the brazen censers out of the midst of
  the men that have been burnt, and scatter the strange fire yonder, for they
  have sanctified the censers <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:38)</span> of
  these sinners against their own souls, and do thou make them beaten plates a
  covering to the altar, because they were brought before the Lord and
  hallowed; and they became a sign to the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16:39)</span> And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest took
  the brazen censers, which the men who had been burnt brought near, and they
  put them as a covering on the altar: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16:40)</span> a memorial to the children of Israel that no
  stranger might draw nigh, who is not of the seed of Aaron, to offer incense
  before the Lord; so he shall not be as Core and as they that conspired with
  him, as the Lord spoke to him by the hand of Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16:41)</span> And the children of Israel murmured the next
  day against Moses and Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:42)</span> And it came to pass when the
  congregation combined against Moses and Aaron, that they ran impetuously to
  the tabernacle of witness; and the cloud covered it, and the glory of the
  Lord appeared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:43)</span> And Moses and Aaron
  went in, in front of the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16:44)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:45)</span> Depart out of the midst of this
  congregation, and I will consume them at once: and they fell upon their
  faces. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:46)</span> And Moses said to Aaron,
  Take a censer, and put on it fire from the altar, and put incense on it, and
  carry it away quickly into the camp, and make atonement for them; for wrath
  is gone forth from the presence of the Lord, it has begun to destroy the
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:47)</span> And Aaron took as Moses
  spoke to him, and ran among the congregation, for already the plague had
  begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:48)</span> And he stood between the
  dead and the living, and the plague ceased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16:49)</span> And they that died in the plague were fourteen
  thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died on account of Core.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16:50)</span> And Aaron returned to Moses to the
  door of the tabernacle of witness, and the plague ceased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods of
  them, according to the houses of their families, a rod from all their
  princes, according to the houses of their families, twelve rods, and write
  the name of each on his rod. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And write
  the name of Aaron on the rod of Levi; for it is one rod for each: they shall
  give them according to the tribe of the house of their families. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt put them in the tabernacle of
  witness, before the testimony, where I will be made known to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And it shall be, the man whom I shall
  choose, his rod shall blossom; and I will remove from me the murmuring of the
  children of Israel, which they murmur against you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all
  their chiefs gave him a rod each, for one chief a rod, according to the house
  of their families, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was in the midst of the
  rods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Moses laid up the rods
  before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses and
  Aaron went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for
  the house of Levi blossomed, and put forth a bud, and bloomed blossoms and
  produced almonds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Moses brought
  forth all the rods from before the Lord to all the sons of Israel; and they
  looked, and each one took his rod. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And the Lord said to Moses, Lay up the rod of Aaron before the testimonies to
  be kept as a sign for the children of the disobedient; and let their
  murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded
  Moses, so did they. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the children
  of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we are cut off, we are destroyed,
  we are consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Every one that
  touches the tabernacle of the Lord, dies: shall we die utterly?
  <h3 id="numbers18">18</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Aaron, saying, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house shall bear
  the sins of the holy things, and thou and thy sons shall bear the iniquity of
  your priesthood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And take to thyself
  thy brethren the tribe of Levi, the family of thy father, and let them be
  joined to thee, and let them minister to thee; and thou and thy sons with
  thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they shall keep thy charges, and the charges
  of the tabernacle; only they shall not approach the holy vessels and the
  altar, so both they and you shall not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they shall be joined to thee, and shall keep
  the charges of the tabernacle of witness, in all the services of the
  tabernacle; and a stranger shall not approach to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And ye shall keep the charges of the holy things,
  and the charges of the altar, and so there shall not be anger among the
  children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I have taken
  your brethren the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, a
  present given to the Lord, to minister in the services of the tabernacle of
  witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And thou and thy sons after
  thee shall keep up your priestly ministration, according to the whole manner
  of the altar, and that which is within the veil; and ye shall minister in the
  services as the office of your priesthood; and the stranger that comes near
  shall die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord said to Aaron,
  And, behold, I have given you the charge of the first-fruits of all things
  consecrated to me by the children of Israel; and I have given them to thee as
  an honour, and to thy sons after thee for a perpetual ordinance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And let this be to you from all the holy things
  that are consecrated to me, even the burnt-offerings, from all their gifts,
  and from all their sacrifices, and from every trespass-offering of theirs,
  and from all their sin-offerings, whatever things they give to me of all
  their holy things, they shall be thine and thy sons’. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> In the most holy place shall ye eat them; every
  male shall eat them, thou and thy sons: they shall be holy to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And this shall be to you of the
  first-fruits of their gifts, of all the wave-offerings of the children of
  Israel; to thee have I given them and to thy sons and thy daughters with
  thee, a perpetual ordinance; every clean person in thy house shall eat them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Every first-offering of oil, and
  every first-offering of wine, their first-fruits of corn, whatsoever they may
  give to the Lord, to thee have I given them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> All the first-fruits that are in their land,
  whatsoever they shall offer to the Lord, shall be thine: every clean person
  in thy house shall eat them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Every
  devoted thing among the children of Israel shall be thine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And every thing that opens the womb of all flesh,
  whatsoever they bring to the Lord, whether man or beast, shall be thine: only
  the first-born of men shall be surely redeemed, and thou shalt redeem the
  first-born of unclean cattle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the
  redemption of them shall be from a month old; their valuation of five
  shekels—it is twenty oboli according to the holy shekel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But thou shalt not redeem the first-born of
  calves and the first-born of sheep and the first-born of goats; they are
  holy: and thou shalt pour their blood upon the altar, and thou shalt offer
  the fat as a burnt-offering for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the flesh shall be thine, as also
  the breast of the wave-offering and as the right shoulder, it shall be thine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Every special offering of the holy
  things, whatsoever the children of Israel shall specially offer to the Lord,
  I have given to thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, a
  perpetual ordinance: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord, for
  thee and thy seed after thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  Lord said to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither
  shalt thou have any portion among them; for I am thy portion and thine
  inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And, behold, I have given to the sons of Levi
  every tithe in Israel for an inheritance for their services, whereinsoever
  they perform ministry in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the children of Israel shall no more draw
  nigh to the tabernacle of witness to incur fatal guilt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Levite himself shall perform the service
  of the tabernacle of witness; and they shall bear their iniquities, it is a
  perpetual statute throughout their generations; and in the midst of the
  children of Israel they shall not receive an inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Because I have given as a distinct portion to the
  Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the children of Israel, whatsoever
  they shall offer to the Lord; therefore I said to them, In the midst of the
  children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Thou shalt also speak to the Levites, and shalt
  say to them, If ye take the tithe from the children of Israel, which I have
  given you from them for an inheritance, then shall ye separate from it a
  heave-offering to the Lord, a tenth of the tenth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And your heave-offerings shall be reckoned to you
  as corn from the floor, and an offering from the wine-press. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> So shall ye also separate them from all the
  offerings of the Lord out of all your tithes, whatsoever ye shall receive
  from the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them an offering to the
  Lord to Aaron the priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Of all your
  gifts ye shall offer an offering to the Lord, and of every first-fruit the
  consecrated part from it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And thou
  shalt say to them, When ye shall offer the first-fruits from it, then shall
  it be reckoned to the Levites as produce from the threshing-floor, and as
  produce from the wine-press. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And ye
  shall eat it in any place, ye and your families; for this is your reward for
  your services in the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And ye shall not bear sin by reason of it, for ye
  shall have offered an offering of first-fruits from it, and ye shall not
  profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
  <h3 id="numbers19">19</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> This
  is the constitution of the law, as the Lord has commanded, saying, Speak to
  the sons of Israel, and let them take for thee a red heifer without spot,
  which has no spot on her, and on which no yoke has been put. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt give her to Eleazar the priest; and
  they shall bring her out of the camp into a clean place, and shall kill her
  before his face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Eleazar shall
  take of her blood, and sprinkle of her blood seven times in front of the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they shall
  burn her to ashes before him; and her skin and her flesh and her blood, with
  her dung, shall be consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the
  priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool, and they shall cast
  them into the midst of the burning of the heifer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the priest shall wash his garments, and bathe
  his body in water, and afterwards he shall go into the camp, and the priest
  shall be unclean till evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he
  that burns her shall wash his garments, and bathe his body, and shall be
  unclean till evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And a clean man
  shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up in a clean place
  outside the camp; and they shall be for the congregation of the children of
  Israel to keep: it is the water of sprinkling, a purification. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he that gathers up the ashes of the heifer
  shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening; and it shall be
  a perpetual statute for the children of Israel and for the strangers joined
  to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He that touches the dead
  body of any man, shall be unclean seven days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He shall be purified on the third day and the
  seventh day, and shall be clean; but if he be not purged on the third day and
  the seventh day, he shall not be clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Every one that touches the carcase of the person
  of a man, if he should have died, and the other not have been purified, has
  defiled the tabernacle of the Lord: that soul shall be cut off from Israel,
  because the water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is
  unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And this is the law; if a man die in a house,
  every one that goes into the house, and all things in the house, shall be
  unclean seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And every open
  vessel which has not a covering bound upon it, shall be unclean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And every one who shall touch a man slain by
  violence, or a corpse, or human bone, or sepulchre, shall be unclean seven
  days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they shall take for the
  unclean of the burnt ashes of purification, and they shall pour upon them
  running water into a vessel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And a
  clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it into the water, and sprinkle it upon
  the house, and the furniture, and all the souls that are therein, and upon
  him that touched the human bone, or the slain man, or the corpse, or the
  tomb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the clean man shall
  sprinkle the water on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day,
  and on the seventh day he shall purify himself; and the other shall wash his
  garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And whatever man shall be defiled and
  shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the
  congregation, because he has defiled the holy things of the Lord, because the
  water of sprinkling has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it shall be to you a perpetual
  statute; and he that sprinkles the water of sprinkling shall wash his
  garments; and he that touches the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until
  evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And whatsoever the unclean
  man shall touch shall be unclean, and the soul that touches it shall be
  unclean till evening.
  <h3 id="numbers20">20</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of
  Sin, in the first month, and the people abode in Cades; and Mariam died
  there, and was buried there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And there
  was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together
  against Moses and Aaron. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the
  people reviled Moses, saying, Would we had died in the destruction of our
  brethren before the Lord! <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  wherefore have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this
  wilderness, to kill us and our cattle? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And wherefore is this? Ye have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should
  come into this evil place; a place where there is no sowing, neither figs,
  nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly
  to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and they fell upon their faces; and
  the glory of the Lord appeared to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Take thy rod, and call the assembly, thou and
  Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before them, and it shall give
  forth its waters; and ye shall bring forth for them water out of the rock,
  and give drink to the congregation and their cattle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Moses took his rod which was before the Lord,
  as the Lord commanded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Moses and
  Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and said to them, Hear me,
  ye disobedient ones; must we bring you water out of this rock? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock
  with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank,
  and their cattle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord said
  to Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not believed me to sanctify me before the
  children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the
  land which I have given them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> This is
  the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before
  the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king
  of Edom, saying, Thus says thy brother Israel; Thou knowest all the distress
  that has come upon us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And how our
  fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the
  Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our
  voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the
  city of Cades, at the extremity of thy coasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> We will pass through thy land: we will not go
  through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of
  thy cistern: we will go by the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the
  right hand or to the left, until we have passed thy borders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass through
  me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet thee in war. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the children of Israel say to him, We will
  pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, I will pay
  thee: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said, Thou shalt not pass
  through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty
  hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So Edom refused to allow Israel
  to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they departed from Cades; and the children of
  Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount
  Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Let Aaron be added to his people; for ye shall
  certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel,
  because ye provoked me at the water of strife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them
  up to the mount Or before all the congregation; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and take Aaron’s apparel from off him, and put it
  on Eleazar his son: and let Aaron die there and be added to his people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Moses did as the Lord commanded
  him, and took him up to mount Or, before all the congregation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he took Aaron’s garments off him, and put
  them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died on the top of the mountain; and Moses
  and Eleazar came down from the mountain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead:
  and they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
  <h3 id="numbers21">21</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Arad the
  Chananitish king who dwelt by the wilderness, heard that Israel came by the
  way of Atharin; and he made war on Israel, and carried off some of them
  captives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Israel vowed a vow to
  the Lord, and said, If thou wilt deliver this people into my power, I will
  devote it and its cities to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered the Chananite into
  his power; and Israel devoted him and his cities, and they called the name of
  that place Anathema. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And having
  departed from mount Or by the way leading to the Red Sea, they compassed the
  land of Edom, and the people lost courage by the way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the people spoke against God and against
  Moses, saying, Why is this? Hast thou brought us ought of Egypt to slay us in
  the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this
  light bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord sent among
  the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the
  children of Israel died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the
  Lord, and against thee: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the
  serpent from us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Moses prayed to
  the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make thee a serpent, and
  put it on a signal-staff; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent
  shall bite a man, every one so bitten that looks upon it shall live.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and
  put it upon a signal-staff: and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a
  man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the children of Israel departed, and encamped
  in Oboth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And having departed from
  Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness,
  which is opposite Moab, toward the east. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thence they departed, and encamped in the
  valley of Zared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they departed
  thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness, the country
  which extends from the coasts of the Amorites; for Arnon is the borders of
  Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Therefore it is said in a book, A war of the Lord has set on fire Zoob, and
  the brooks of Arnon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he has
  appointed brooks to cause Er to dwell there; and it lies near to the coasts
  of Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And thence they came to the
  well; this is the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people,
  and I will give them water to drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Then Israel sang this song at the well, Begin to sing of the well;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> the princes digged it, the kings of
  the nations in their kingdom, in their lordship sank it in the rock: and they
  went from the well to Manthanain, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and
  from Manthanain to Naaliel, and from Naaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to
  Janen, which is in the plain of Moab as seen from the top of the quarried
  rock that looks toward the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Moses sent ambassadors to Seon king of the
  Amorites, with peaceable words, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> We will pass through thy land, we will go by the
  road; we will not turn aside to the field or to the vineyard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> We will not drink water out of thy well; we will
  go by the king’s highway, until we have past thy boundaries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Seon did not allow Israel to pass through his
  borders, and Seon gathered all his people, and went out to set the battle in
  array against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jassa, and set the
  battle in array against Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  Israel smote him with the slaughter of the sword, and they became possessors
  of his land, from Arnon to Jaboc, as far as the children of Amman, for Jazer
  is the borders of the children of Amman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Israel took all their cities, and Israel
  dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Esebon, and in all cities
  belonging to it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For Esebon is the
  city of Seon king of the Amorites; and he before fought against the king of
  Moab, and they took all his land, from Aroer to Arnon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Therefore say they who deal in dark speeches,
  Come to Esebon, that the city of Seon may be built and prepared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For a fire has gone forth from Esebon, a flame
  from the city of Seon, and has consumed as far as Moab, and devoured the
  pillars of Arnon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Woe to thee, Moab;
  thou art lost, thou people of Chamos: their sons are sold for preservation,
  and their daughters are captives to Seon king of the Amorites. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And their seed shall perish from Esebon to
  Daebon; and their women have yet farther kindled a fire against Moab.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Israel dwelt in all the cities of
  the Amorites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Moses sent to spy
  out Jazer; and they took it, and its villages, and cast out the Amorite that
  dwelt there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And having returned,
  they went up the road that leads to Basan; and Og the king of Basan went
  forth to meet them, and all his people to war to Edrain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Fear him not; for I
  have delivered him and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and
  thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in
  Esebon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he smote him and his
  sons, and all his people, until he left none of his to be taken alive; and
  they inherited his land.
  <h3 id="numbers22">22</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Israel departed, and encamped on the west of Moab by Jordan
  toward Jericho. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And when Balac son of
  Sepphor saw all that Israel did to the Amorite, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> then Moab feared the people exceedingly because
  they were many; and Moab was grieved before the face of the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moab said to the elders of
  Madiam, Now shall this assembly lick up all that are round about us, as a
  calf would lick up the green herbs of the field:—and Balac son of Sepphor was
  king of Moab at that time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he sent
  ambassadors to Balaam the son of Beor, to Phathura, which is on a river of
  the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is
  come out of Egypt, and behold it has covered the face of the earth, and it
  has encamped close to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And now
  come, curse me this people, for it is stronger than we; if we may be able to
  smite some of them, and I will cast them out of the land: for I know that
  whomsoever thou dost bless, they are blessed, and whomsoever thou dost curse,
  they are cursed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the elders of
  Moab went, and the elders of Madiam, and their divining instruments were in
  their hands; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balac.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he said to them, Tarry here the
  night, and I will answer you the things which the Lord shall say to me; and
  the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God came to Balaam, and said to him, Who are
  these men with thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Balaam said
  to God, Balac son of Sepphor, king of Moab, sent them to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Behold, a people has come forth out
  of Egypt, and has covered the face of the land, and it has encamped near to
  me; and now come, curse it for me, if indeed I shall be able to smite it, and
  cast it out of the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And God said
  to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them, neither shalt thou curse the people;
  for they are blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Balaam rose
  up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balac, Depart quickly to your
  lord; God does not permit me to go with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the princes of Moab rose, and came to Balac,
  and said, Balaam will not come with us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Balac yet again sent more princes and more
  honourable than they. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they came
  to Balaam, and they say to him, Thus says Balac the son of Sepphor: I beseech
  thee, delay not to come to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For I
  will greatly honour thee, and will do for thee whatsoever thou shalt say;
  come then, curse me this people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  Balaam answered and said to the princes of Balac, If Balac would give me his
  house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to go beyond the word of
  the Lord God, to make it little or great in my mind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And now do ye also tarry here this night, and I
  shall know what the Lord will yet say to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And God came to Balaam by night, and said to him,
  If these men are come to call thee, rise and follow them; nevertheless the
  word which I shall speak to thee, it shalt thou do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled
  his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And God was very angry because he went; and the
  angel of the Lord rose up to withstand him. Now he had mounted his ass, and
  his two servants were with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  when the ass saw the angel of God standing opposite in the way, and his sword
  drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into
  the field; and Balaam smote the ass with his staff to direct her in the way.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the angel of the Lord stood in
  the avenues of the vines, a fence being on this side and a fence on that.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And when the ass saw the angel of
  God, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against
  the wall, and he smote her again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  the angel of the Lord went farther, and came and stood in a narrow place
  where it was impossible to turn to the right or the left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And when the ass saw the angel of God, she lay
  down under Balaam; and Balaam was angry, and struck the ass with his staff.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And God opened the mouth of the ass,
  and she says to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me
  this third time? <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Balaam said to
  the ass, Because thou hast mocked me; and if I had had a sword in my hand, I
  would now have killed thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the
  ass says to Balaam, Am not I thine ass on which thou hast ridden since thy
  youth till this day? did I ever do thus to thee, utterly disregarding thee?
  and he said, No. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And God opened the
  eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the Lord withstanding him in the
  way, and his sword drawn in his hand, and he stooped down and worshipped on
  his face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the angel of God said
  to him, Why hast thou smitten thine ass this third time? and, behold, I came
  out to withstand thee, for thy way was not seemly before me; and when the ass
  saw me, she turned away from me this third time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And if she had not turned out of the way, surely
  now, I should have slain thee, and should have saved her alive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have
  sinned, for I did not know that thou wert standing opposite in the way to
  meet me; and now if it shall not be pleasing to thee for me to go on, I will
  return. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the angel of the Lord
  said to Balaam, Go with the men: nevertheless the word which I shall speak to
  thee, that thou shalt take heed to speak. And Balaam went with the princes of
  Balac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And when Balac heard that
  Balaam was come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on the
  borders of Arnon, which is on the extreme part of the borders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Balac said to Balaam, Did I not send to thee
  to call thee? why hast thou not come to me? shall I not indeed be able to
  honour thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Balaam said to
  Balac, Behold, I am now come to thee: shall I be able to say anything? the
  word which God shall put into my mouth, that I shall speak. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Balaam went with Balac, and they came to the
  cities of streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Balac offered
  sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to his princes who were with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And it was morning; and Balac took
  Balaam, and brought him up to the pillar of Baal, and shewed him thence a
  part of the people.
  <h3 id="numbers23">23</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Balaam
  said to Balac, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves,
  and seven rams. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Balac did as
  Balaam told him; and he offered up a calf and a ram on every altar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by thy
  sacrifice, and I will go and see if God will appear to me and meet me, and
  the word which he shall shew me, I will report to thee. And Balac stood by
  his sacrifice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Balaam went to
  enquire of God; and he went straight forward, and God appeared to Balaam; and
  Balaam said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and have offered a calf
  and a ram on every altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And God put
  a word into the mouth of Balaam, and said, thou shalt return to Balac, and
  thus shalt thou speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he returned
  to him, and moreover he stood over his whole-burnt-offerings, and all the
  princes of Moab with him; and the Spirit of God came upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he took up his parable, and said, Balac king
  of Moab sent for me out of Mesopotamia, out of the mountains of the east,
  saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and Come, call for a curse for me upon Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> How can I curse whom the Lord curses
  not? or how can I devote whom God devotes not? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For from the top of the mountains I shall see him,
  and from the hills I shall observe him: behold, the people shall dwell alone,
  and shall not be reckoned among the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Who has exactly calculated the seed of Jacob, and
  who shall number the families of Israel? let my soul die with the souls of
  the righteous, and let my seed be as their seed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Balac said to Balaam, What hast thou done to
  me? I called thee to curse my enemies, and behold thou hast greatly blessed
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Balaam said to Balac,
  Whatsoever the Lord shall put into my mouth, shall I not take heed to speak
  this? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Balac said to him, Come yet
  with me to another place where thou shalt not see the people, but only thou
  shalt see a part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from
  thence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he took him to a high
  place of the field to the top of the quarried rock, and he built there seven
  altars, and offered a calf and a ram on every altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by thy sacrifice,
  and I will go to enquire of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  God met Balaam, and put a word into his mouth, and said, return to Balac, and
  thus shalt thou speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he
  returned to him: and he also was standing by his whole-burnt-sacrifice, and
  all the princes of Moab with him; and Balac said to him, What has the Lord
  spoken? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he took up his parable,
  and said, rise up, Balac, and hear; hearken as a witness, thou son of
  Sepphor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> God is not as man to waver,
  nor as the son of man to be threatened; shall he say and not perform? shall
  he speak and not keep to his word? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Behold, I have received commandment to bless: I will bless, and not turn
  back. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> There shall not be trouble in
  Jacob, neither shall sorrow be seen in Israel: the Lord his God is with him,
  the glories of rulers are in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> It
  was God who brought him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a
  unicorn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For there is no divination
  in Jacob, nor enchantment in Israel; in season it shall be told to Jacob and
  Israel what God shall perform. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Behold, the people shall rise up as a lion’s whelp, and shall exalt himself
  as a lion; he shall not lie down till he have eaten the prey, and he shall
  drink the blood of the slain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  Balac said to Balaam, Neither curse the people at all for me, nor bless them
  at all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Balaam answered and said
  to Balac, Spoke I not to thee, saying, Whatsoever thing God shall speak to
  me, that will I do? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Balac said to
  Balaam, Come and I will remove thee to another place, if it shall please God,
  and curse me them from thence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  Balac took Balaam to the top of Phogor, which extends to the wilderness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Balaam said to Balac, build me
  here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Balac did as Balaam told him, and
  offered a calf and a ram on every altar.
  <h3 id="numbers24">24</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when
  Balaam saw that it pleased God to bless Israel, he did not go according to
  his custom to meet the omens, but turned his face toward the wilderness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and
  sees Israel encamped by their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he took up his parable and said,
  Balaam son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he says who hears the oracle of the Mighty One,
  who saw a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were opened: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> How goodly are thy habitations, Jacob, and thy
  tents, Israel! <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> as shady groves, and as
  gardens by a river, and as tents which God pitched, and as cedars by the
  waters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> There shall come a man out of
  his seed, and he shall rule over many nations; and the kingdom of Gog shall
  be exalted, and his kingdom shall be increased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> God led him out of Egypt; he has as it were the
  glory of a unicorn: he shall consume the nations of his enemies, and he shall
  drain their marrow, and with his darts he shall shoot through the enemy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He lay down, he rested as a lion, and
  as a young lion; who shall stir him up? they that bless thee are blessed, and
  they that curse thee are cursed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  Balac was angry with Balaam, and clapped his hands together; and Balac said
  to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemy, and behold thou hast decidedly
  blessed him this third time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Now
  therefore flee to thy place: I said, I will honour thee, but now the Lord has
  deprived thee of glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Balaam
  said to Balac, Did I not speak to thy messengers also whom thou sentest to
  me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> If Balac should give me
  his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to transgress the word
  of the Lord to make it good or bad by myself; whatsoever things God shall
  say, them will I speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And now,
  behold, I return to my place; come, I will advise thee of what this people
  shall do to thy people in the last days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the
  son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> hearing the oracles of God, receiving knowledge
  from the Most High, and having seen a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were
  opened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I will point to him, but not
  now; I bless him, but he draws not near: a star shall rise out of Jacob, a
  man shall spring out of Israel; and shall crush the princes of Moab, and
  shall spoil all the sons of Seth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  Edom shall be an inheritance, and Esau his enemy shall be an inheritance of
  Israel, and Israel wrought valiantly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And one shall arise out of Jacob, and destroy out of the city him that
  escapes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having seen Amalec, he
  took up his parable and said, Amalec is the first of the nations; yet his
  seed shall perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And having seen
  the Kenite, he took up his parable and said, thy dwelling-place is strong;
  yet though thou shouldest put thy nest in a rock, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and though Beor should have a skillfully
  contrived hiding-place, the Assyrians shall carry thee away captive.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he looked upon Og, and took up
  his parable and said, Oh, oh, who shall live, when God shall do these things?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And one shall come forth from the
  hands of the Citians, and shall afflict Assur, and shall afflict the Hebrews,
  and they shall perish together. (25) And Balaam rose up and departed and
  returned to his place, and Balac went to his own home.
  <h3 id="numbers25">25</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Israel
  sojourned in Sattin, and the people profaned itself by going a-whoring after
  the daughters of Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they called
  them to the sacrifices of their idols; and the people ate of their
  sacrifices, and worshipped their idols. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Israel consecrated themselves to Beel-phegor;
  and the Lord was very angry with Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Take all the princes
  of the people, and make them examples of judgment for the Lord in the face of
  the sun, and the anger of the Lord shall be turned away from Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Moses said to the tribes of
  Israel, Slay ye every one his friend that is consecrated to Beel-phegor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And, behold, a man of the children of
  Israel came and brought his brother to a Madianitish woman before Moses, and
  before all the congregation of the children of Israel; and they were weeping
  at the door of the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Phinees the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron
  the priest, saw it, and rose out of the midst of the congregation, and took a
  javelin in his hand, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and went in after
  the Israelitish man into the chamber, and pierced them both through, both the
  Israelitish man, and the woman through her womb; and the plague was stayed
  from the children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And those
  that died in the plague were four and twenty thousand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the
  priest has caused my wrath to cease from the children of Israel, when I was
  exceedingly jealous among them, and I did not consume the children of Israel
  in my jealousy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thus do thou say to
  him, Behold, I give him a covenant of peace: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and he and his seed after him shall have a
  perpetual covenant of priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and
  made atonement for the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Now the name of the smitten Israelitish man, who
  was smitten with the Madianitish woman, was Zambri son of Salmon, prince of a
  house of the tribe of Symeon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the
  name of the Madianitish woman who was smitten, was Chasbi, daughter of Sur, a
  prince of the nation of Ommoth: it is a chief house among the people of
  Madiam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, Speak to the children of Israel, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Plague the Madianites as enemies, and smite them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> for they are enemies to you by the
  treachery wherein they ensnare you through Phogor, and through Chasbi their
  sister, daughter of a prince of Madiam, who was smitten in the day of the
  plague because of Phogor.
  <h3 id="numbers26">26</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came
  to pass after the plague, that the Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar the
  priest, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Take the sum of all
  the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward,
  according to the houses of their lineage, every one that goes forth to battle
  in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Moses and Eleazar the
  priest spoke in Araboth of Moab at the Jordan by Jericho, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> This is the numbering from twenty
  years old and upward as the Lord commanded Moses. And the sons of Israel that
  came out of Egypt are as follows: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Ruben was the first-born of Israel: and the sons of Ruben, Enoch, and the
  family of Enoch; to Phallu belongs the family of the Phalluites. <span style=

  families of Ruben; and their numbering was forty-three thousand and seven
  hundred and thirty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the sons of
  Phallu were Eliab, — <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and the sons of
  Eliab, Namuel, and Dathan, and Abiron: these are renowned men of the
  congregation; these are they that rose up against Moses and Aaron in the
  gathering of Core, in the rebellion against the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up
  them and Core, when their assembly perished, when the fire devoured the two
  hundred and fifty, and they were made a sign. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the sons of Core died not. <span style=

  may inherit according to the number of the names. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> To the greater number thou shalt give the greater
  inheritance, and to the less number thou shalt give the less inheritance: to
  each one, as they have been numbered, shall their inheritance be given.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> The land shall be divided to the
  names by lot, they shall inherit according to the tribes of their families.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Thou shalt divide their inheritance

  Eleazar, and Ithamar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And Nadab and
  Abiud died when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness
  of Sina. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And there were according to
  their numbering, twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and
  upward; for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because they
  have no inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And this is the numbering of Moses and Eleazar
  the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in Araboth of Moab, at Jordan
  by Jericho. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> And among these there was
  not a man numbered by Moses and Aaron, whom, even the children of Israel,
  they numbered in the wilderness of Sinai. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> For the Lord said to them, They shall surely die
  in the wilderness; and there was not left even one of them, except Chaleb the
  son of Jephonne, and Joshua the son of Naue.
  <h3 id="numbers27">27</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  daughters of Salpaad the son of Opher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir,
  of the tribe of Manasse, of the sons of Joseph, came near; and these were
  their names, Maala, and Nua, and Egla, and Melcha, and Thersa; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar
  the priest, and before the princes, and before all the congregation at the
  door of the tabernacle of witness, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not
  in the midst of the congregation that rebelled against the Lord in the
  gathering of Core; for he died for his own sin, and he had no sons. Let not
  the name of our father be blotted out of the midst of his people, because he
  has no son: give us an inheritance in the midst of our father’s brethren.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moses brought their case before
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The daughters of Salpaad have
  spoken rightly: thou shalt surely give them a possession of inheritance in
  the midst of their father’s brethren, and thou shalt assign their father’s
  inheritance to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And thou shalt
  speak to the children of Israel, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If a man die, and have no son, ye shall assign his
  inheritance to his daughter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if he
  have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance to his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And if he have no brethren, ye shall give his
  inheritance to his father’s brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And if there be no brethren of his father, ye shall give the inheritance to
  his nearest relation of his tribe, to inherit his possessions; and this shall
  be to the children of Israel an ordinance of judgment, as the Lord commanded
  Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Go
  up to the mountain that is in the country beyond Jordan, this mount Nabau,
  and behold the land Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a
  possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou shalt see it,
  and thou also shalt be added to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was added to
  them in mount Or: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> because ye
  transgressed my commandment in the wilderness of Sin, when the congregation
  resisted and refused to sanctify me; ye sanctified me not at the water before
  them. This is the water of Strife in Cades in the wilderness of Sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Moses said to the Lord,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Let the Lord God of spirits and of
  all flesh look out for a man over this congregation, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> who shall go out before them, and who shall come
  in before them, and who shall lead them out, and who shall bring them in; so
  the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep without a shepherd.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  Take to thyself Joshua the son of Naue, a man who has the Spirit in him, and
  thou shalt lay thy hands upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and thou shalt give him a
  charge before all the congregation, and thou shalt give a charge concerning
  him before them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And thou shalt put
  of thy glory upon him, that the children of Israel may hearken to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he shall stand before Eleazar the
  priest, and they shall ask of him before the Lord the judgment of the Urim:
  they shall go forth at his word, and at his word they shall come in, he and
  the children of Israel with one accord, and all the congregation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Moses did as the Lord commanded
  him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before
  all the congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he laid his
  hands on him, and appointed him as the Lord ordered Moses.
  <h3 id="numbers28">28</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Charge the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt speak to them, saying, Ye shall observe to
  offer to me in my feasts my gifts, my presents, my burnt-offerings for a
  sweet-smelling savour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt
  say to them, These are the burnt-offerings, all that ye shall bring to the
  Lord; two lambs of a year old without blemish daily, for a whole-burnt
  offering perpetually. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thou shalt offer
  one lamb in the morning, and thou shalt offer the second lamb towards
  evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And thou shalt offer the
  tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil,
  with the fourth part of a hin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> It is a
  perpetual whole-burnt-offering, a sacrifice offered in the mount of Sina for
  a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And its drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin to each lamb; in the holy
  place shalt thou pour strong drink as a drink-offering to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the second lamb thou shalt offer
  toward evening; thou shalt offer it according to its meat-offering and
  according to its drink-offering for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And on the sabbath-day ye shall offer

  <h3 id="numbers30">30</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Moses
  spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord commanded
  Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Moses spoke to the heads of
  the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the
  Lord has commanded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Whatsoever man
  shall vow a vow to the Lord, or swear an oath, or bind himself with an
  obligation upon his soul, he shall not break his word; all that shall come
  out of his mouth he shall do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if a
  woman shall vow a vow to the Lord, or bind herself with an obligation in her
  youth in her father’s house; and her father should hear her vows and her
  obligations, wherewith she has bound her soul, and her father should hold his
  peace at her, then all her vows shall stand, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and all the obligations with which she has bound
  her soul, shall remain to her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But if
  her father straitly forbid her in the day in which he shall hear all her vows
  and her obligations, which she has contracted upon her soul, they shall not
  stand; and the Lord shall hold her guiltless, because her father forbade her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But if she should be indeed married,
  and her vows be upon her according to the utterance of her lips, in respect
  of the obligations which she has contracted upon her soul; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and her husband should hear, and hold his peace at
  her in the day in which he should hear, then thus shall all her vows be
  binding, and her obligations, which she has contracted upon her soul shall
  stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But if her husband should
  straitly forbid her in the day in which he should hear her, none of her vows
  or obligations which she has contracted upon her soul shall stand, because
  her husband has disallowed her, and the Lord shall hold her guiltless.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the vow of a widow and of her
  that is put away, whatsoever she shall bind upon her soul, shall stand to
  her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And if her vow be made in the
  house of her husband, or the obligation upon her soul with an oath,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and her husband should hear, and hold
  his peace at her, and not disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and
  all the obligations which she contracted against her soul, shall stand
  against her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But if her husband
  should utterly cancel the vow in the day in which he shall hear it, none of
  the things which shall proceed out of her lips in her vows, and in the
  obligations contracted upon her soul, shall stand to her; her husband has
  cancelled them, and the Lord shall hold her guiltless. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict her
  soul, her husband shall confirm it to her, or her husband shall cancel it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But if he be wholly silent at her
  from day to day, then shall he bind upon her all her vows; and he shall
  confirm to her the obligations which she has bound upon herself, because he
  held his peace at her in the day in which he heard her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if her husband should in any wise cancel them
  after the day in which he heard them, then he shall bear his iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These are the ordinances which the
  Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and
  daughter in her youth in the house of her father.
  <h3 id="numbers31">31</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Avenge the
  wrongs of the children of Israel on the Madianites, and afterwards thou shalt
  be added to thy people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Moses
  spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of you, and set yourselves in array
  before the Lord against Madian, to inflict vengeance on Madian from the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Send a thousand of each tribe from all
  the tribes of the children of Israel to set themselves in array. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they numbered of the thousands of Israel a
  thousand of each tribe, twelve thousands; these were armed for war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses sent them away a thousand of
  every tribe with their forces, and Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of
  Aaron the priest: and the holy instruments, and the signal trumpets were in
  their hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they set themselves
  in array against Madian, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew every
  male. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they slew the kings of
  Madian together with their slain subjects; even Evi and Rocon, and Sur, and
  Ur, and Roboc, five kings of Madian; and they slew with the sword Balaam the
  son of Beor with their other slain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And they made a prey of the women of Madian, and their store, and their
  cattle, and all their possessions: and they spoiled their forces.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they burnt with fire all their
  cities in the places of their habitation and they burnt their villages with
  fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they took all their
  plunder, and all their spoils, both man and beast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they brought to Moses and to Eleazar the
  priest, and to all the children of Israel, the captives, and the spoils, and
  the plunder, to the camp to Araboth Moab, which is at Jordan by Jericho.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest and
  all the rulers of the synagogue went forth out of the camp to meet them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Moses was angry with the captains
  of the host, the heads of thousands and the heads of hundreds who came from
  the battle-array. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Moses said to
  them, Why have ye saved every female alive? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For they were the occasion to the children of
  Israel by the word of Balaam of their revolting and despising the word of the
  Lord, because of Phogor; and there was a plague in the congregation of the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Now then slay every male in all
  the spoil, slay every woman, who has known the lying with man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And as for all the captivity of women, who have
  not known the lying with man, save ye them alive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And ye shall encamp outside the great camp seven
  days; every one who has slain and who touches a dead body, shall be purified
  on the third day, and ye and your captivity shall purify yourselves on the
  seventh day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And ye shall purify
  every garment and every leathern utensil, and all furniture of goat skin, and
  every wooden vessel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Eleazar the
  priest said to the men of the host that came from the battle-array, This is
  the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Beside the gold, and the silver, and the brass,
  and the iron, and lead, and tin, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  every thing that shall pass through the fire shall so be clean, nevertheless
  it shall be purified with the water of sanctification; and whatsoever will
  not pass through the fire shall pass through water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And on the seventh day ye shall wash your
  garments, and be clean; and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Take the sum of the spoils of the
  captivity both of man and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the heads
  of the families of the congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And ye shall divide the spoils between the warriors that went out to battle,
  and the whole congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And ye
  shall take a tribute for the Lord from the warriors that went out to battle;
  one soul out of five hundred, from the men, and from the cattle, even from
  the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the asses; and ye shall take from
  their half. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And thou shalt give them
  to Eleazar the priest as the first-fruits of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And from the half belonging to the children of
  Israel thou shalt take one in fifty from the men, and from the oxen, and from
  the sheep, and from the asses, and from all the cattle; and thou shalt give
  them to the Levites that keep the charges in the tabernacle of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest did
  as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And that
  which remained of the spoil which the warriors took, was—of the sheep, six
  hundred and seventy-five thousand: <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  and oxen, seventy-two thousand: <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and
  asses, sixty-one thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And
  persons of women who had not known lying with man, all the souls, thirty-two
  thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the half, even the
  portion of them that went out to war, from the number of the sheep, was three
  hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the tribute to the Lord from the sheep was
  six hundred and seventy-five. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the
  oxen, six and thirty thousand, and the tribute to the Lord seventy-two.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And asses, thirty thousand and five
  hundred, and the tribute to the Lord, sixty-one: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and the persons, sixteen thousand, and the
  tribute of them to the Lord, thirty-two souls. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Moses gave the tribute to the Lord, the
  heave-offering of God, to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> from the half belonging to the
  children of Israel, whom Moses separated from the men of war. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And the half taken from the sheep, belonging to
  the congregation, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five
  hundred. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the oxen, thirty-six
  thousand; <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> asses, thirty thousand and
  five hundred; <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> and persons, sixteen
  thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And Moses took of the half
  belonging to the children of Israel the fiftieth part, of men and of cattle,
  and he gave them to the Levites who keep the charges of the tabernacle of the
  Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span>
  And all those who were appointed to be officers of thousands of the host,
  captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, approached Moses, and said to
  Moses, <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Thy servants have taken the
  sum of the men of war with us, and not one is missing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And we have brought our gift to the Lord, every
  man who has found an article of gold, whether an armlet, or a chain, or a
  ring, or a bracelet, or a clasp for hair, to make atonement for us before the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Moses and Eleazar the
  priest took the gold from them, even every wrought article. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And all the wrought gold, even the offering that
  they offered to the Lord, was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty
  shekels from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> For the men of war took plunder every
  one for himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And Moses and
  Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and captains
  of hundreds, and brought the vessels into the tabernacle of witness, a
  memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord.
  <h3 id="numbers32">32</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  children of Ruben and the children of Gad had a multitude of cattle, very
  great; and they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Galaad; and the place
  was a place for cattle: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and the
  children of Ruben and the children of Gad came, and spoke to Moses, and to
  Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ataroth, and Daebon, and Jazer, and
  Namra, and Esebon, and Eleale, and Sebama, and Nabau, and Baean, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> the land which the Lord has delivered up before
  the children of Israel, is pasture land, and thy servants have cattle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they said, If we have found grace
  in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, and do
  not cause us to pass over Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben, Shall your brethren go
  to war, and shall ye sit here? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And why
  do ye pervert the minds of the children of Israel, that they should not cross
  over into the land, which the Lord gives them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Did not your fathers thus, when I sent them from
  Cades Barne to spy out the land? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  they went up to the valley of the cluster, and spied the land, and turned
  aside the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the
  land, which the Lord gave them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  the Lord was very angry in that day, and sware, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Surely these men who came up out of Egypt from
  twenty years old and upward, who know good and evil, shall not see the land
  which I sware to give to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, for they have not
  closely followed after me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> save Caleb
  the son of Jephonne, who was set apart, and Joshua the son of Naue, for they
  closely followed after the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  the Lord was very angry with Israel; and for forty years he caused them to
  wander in the wilderness, until all the generation which did evil in the
  sight of the Lord was extinct. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Behold, ye are risen up in the room of your fathers, a combination of sinful
  men, to increase yet farther the fierce wrath of the Lord against Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For ye will turn away from him to
  desert him yet once more in the wilderness, and ye will sin against this
  whole congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they came to
  him, and said, We will build here folds for our cattle, and cities for our
  possessions; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and we will arm
  ourselves and go as an advanced guard before the children of Israel, until we
  shall have brought them into their place; and our possessions shall remain in
  walled cities because of the inhabitants of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> We will not return to our houses till the
  children of Israel shall have been distributed, each to his own inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And we will not any longer inherit
  with them from the other side of Jordan and onwards, because we have our full
  inheritance on the side beyond Jordan eastward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Moses said to them, If ye will do according
  to these words, if ye will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and every one of you will pass over
  Jordan fully armed before the Lord, until his enemy be destroyed from before
  his face, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and the land shall be
  subdued before the Lord, then afterwards ye shall return, and be guiltless
  before the Lord, and as regards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a
  possession before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But if ye
  will not do so, ye will sin against the Lord; and ye shall know your sin,
  when afflictions shall come upon you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And ye shall build for yourselves cities for your store, and folds for your
  cattle; and ye shall do that which proceeds out of your mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad spoke
  to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as our lord commands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Our store, and our wives, and all our cattle
  shall be in the cities of Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But
  thy servants will go over all armed and set in order before the Lord to
  battle, as our lord says. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Moses
  appointed to them for judges Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Naue,
  and the chiefs of the families of the tribes of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Moses said to them, If the sons of Ruben and
  the sons of Gad will pass over Jordan with you, every one armed for war
  before the Lord, and ye shall subdue the land before you, then ye shall give
  to them the land of Galaad for a possession. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But if they will not pass over armed with you to
  war before the Lord, then shall ye cause to pass over their possessions and
  their wives and their cattle before you into the land of Chanaan, and they
  shall inherit with you in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad
  answered, saying, Whatsoever the Lord says to his servants, that will we do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> We will go over armed before the Lord
  into the land of Chanaan, and ye shall give us our inheritance beyond Jordan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Moses gave to them, even to the
  sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasse of the
  sons of Joseph, the kingdom of Seon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of
  Og king of Basan, the land and its cities with its coasts, the cities of the
  land round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the sons of Gad
  built Daebon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  and Sophar, and Jazer, and they set them up, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> and Namram, and Baetharan, strong cities, and
  folds for sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the sons of
  Ruben built Esebon, and Eleale, and Kariatham, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> and Beelmeon, surrounded with walls, and Sebama;
  and they called the names of the cities which they built, after their own
  names. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And a son of Machir the son of
  Manasse went to Galaad, and took it, and destroyed the Amorite who dwelt in
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Moses gave Galaad to Machir
  the son of Manasse, and he dwelt there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Jair the son of Manasse went and took their
  villages, and called them the villages of Jair. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And Nabau went and took Caath and her villages,
  and called them Naboth after his name.
  <h3 id="numbers33">33</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these
  are the stages of the children of Israel, as they went out from the land of
  Egypt with their host by the hand of Moses and Aaron. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Moses wrote their removals and their stages,
  by the word of the Lord: and these are the stages of their journeying.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They departed from Ramesses in the
  first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the
  passover the children of Israel went forth with a high hand before all the
  Egyptians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Egyptians buried
  those that died of them, even all that the Lord smote, every first-born in
  the land of Egypt; also the Lord executed vengeance on their gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the children of Israel departed
  from Ramesses, and encamped in Socchoth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and they departed from Socchoth and encamped in
  Buthan, which is a part of the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they departed from Buthan and encamped at the
  mouth of Iroth, which is opposite Beel-sepphon, and encamped opposite Magdol.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they departed from before Iroth,
  and crossed the middle of the sea into the wilderness; and they went a
  journey of three days through the wilderness, and encamped in Picriae.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they departed from Picriae, and
  came to Ælim; and in Ælim were twelve fountains of water, and seventy
  palm-trees, and they encamped there by the water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they departed from Ælim, and encamped by the
  Red Sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they departed from the

  the wilderness of Sina. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they
  departed from the wilderness of Sina, and encamped at the Graves of Lust.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they departed from the Graves of
  Lust, and encamped in Aseroth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  they departed from Aseroth, and encamped in Rathama. <span style=

  And they departed from Makellath, and encamped in Saphar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they departed from Saphar, and encamped in
  Charadath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they departed from
  Charadath, and encamped in Makeloth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  And they departed from Makeloth, and encamped in Kataath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they departed from Kataath, and encamped in
  Tarath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they departed from

  Masuruth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they departed from

  the Lord, and died there in the fortieth year of the departure of the
  children of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first
  day of the month. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Aaron was a
  hundred and twenty-three years old, when he died in mount Or. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Arad the Chananitish king (he too dwelt in

  departed from Daebon Gad, and encamped in Gelmon Deblathaim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And they departed from Gelmon Deblathaim, and
  encamped on the mountains of Abarim, over against Nabau. <span style=

  and encamped on the west of Moab, at Jordan by Jericho. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And they encamped by Jordan between Æsimoth, as
  far as Belsa to the west of Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And
  the Lord spoke to Moses at the west of Moab by Jordan at Jericho, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and
  thou shalt say to them, Ye are to pass over Jordan into the land of Chanaan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And ye shall destroy all that dwell
  in the land before your face, and ye shall abolish their high places, and all
  their molten images ye shall destroy, and ye shall demolish all their
  pillars. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And ye shall destroy all the
  inhabitants of the land, and ye shall dwell in it, for I have given their
  land to you for an inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And
  ye shall inherit their land according to your tribes; to the greater number
  ye shall give the larger possession, and to the smaller ye shall give the
  less possession; to whatsoever part a man’s name shall go forth by lot, there
  shall be his property: ye shall inherit according to the tribes of your
  families. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> But if ye will not destroy
  the dwellers in the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that
  whomsoever of them ye shall leave shall be thorns in your eyes, and darts in
  your sides, and they shall be enemies to you on the land on which ye shall
  dwell; <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> and it shall come to pass that
  as I had determined to do to them, so I will do to you.
  <h3 id="numbers34">34</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Charge the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye are entering into the land
  of Chanaan: it shall be to you for an inheritance, the land of Chanaan with
  its boundaries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And your southern side
  shall be from the wilderness of Sin to the border of Edom, and your border
  southward shall extend on the side of the salt sea eastward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And your border shall go round you from the south
  to the ascent of Acrabin, and shall proceed by Ennac, and the going forth of
  it shall be southward to Cades Barne, and it shall go forth to the village of
  Arad, and shall proceed by Asemona. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And the border shall compass from Asemona to the river of Egypt, and the sea
  shall be the termination. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall
  have your border on the west, the great sea shall be the boundary: this shall
  be to you the border on the west. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  this shall be your northern border; from the great sea ye shall measure to
  yourselves, by the side of the mountain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And ye shall measure to yourselves the mountain
  from mount Hor at the entering in to Emath, and the termination of it shall
  be the coasts of Saradac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the
  border shall go out to Dephrona, and its termination shall be at Arsenain;
  this shall be your border from the north. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And ye shall measure to yourselves the eastern
  border from Arsenain to Sepphamar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And the border shall go down from Sepphamar to Bela eastward to the
  fountains, and the border shall go down from Bela behind the sea Chenereth
  eastward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the border shall go
  down to Jordan, and the termination shall be the salt sea; this shall be your
  land and its borders round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  Moses charged the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall
  inherit by lot, even as the Lord commanded us to give it to the nine tribes
  and the half-tribe of Manasse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For
  the tribe of the children of Ruben, and the tribe of the children of Gad have
  received their inheritance according to their families; and the half-tribe of
  Manasse have received their inheritances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Two tribes and half a tribe have received their
  inheritance beyond Jordan by Jericho from the south eastwards. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These are the names of the men who shall divide
  the land to you for an inheritance; Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of
  Naue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And ye shall take one ruler
  from each tribe to divide the land to you by lot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And these are the names of the men; of the tribe
  of Juda Chaleb the son of Jephonne. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Of the tribe of Symeon, Salamiel the son of Semiud. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Eldad the son of
  Chaslon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Of the tribe of Dan the
  prince was Bacchir the son of Egli. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  Of the sons of Joseph of the tribe of the sons of Manasse, the prince was
  Aniel the son of Suphi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Of the tribe
  of the sons of Ephraim, the prince was Camuel the son of Sabathan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Of the tribe of Zabulon, the prince
  was Elisaphan the son of Pharnac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Of
  the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince was Phaltiel the son of Oza.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Of the tribe of the children of Aser,
  the prince was Achior the son of Selemi. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Of the tribe of Nephthali, the prince was Phadael
  the son of Jamiud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> These did the Lord
  command to distribute the inheritances to the children of Israel in the land
  of Chanaan.
  <h3 id="numbers35">35</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses to the west of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Give orders to the children of Israel,
  and they shall give to the Levites cities to dwell in from the lot of their
  possession, and they shall give to the Levites the suburbs of the cities
  round about them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the cities shall
  be for them to dwell in, and their enclosures shall be for their cattle and
  all their beasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the suburbs of
  the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the
  city and outwards two thousand cubits round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And thou shalt measure outside the city on the
  east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and
  on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand
  cubits; and your city shall be in the midst of this, and the suburbs of the
  cities as described. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall give
  the cities to the Levites, the six cities of refuge which ye shall give for
  the slayer to flee thither, and in addition to these, forty-two cities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Ye shall give to the Levites in all
  forty-eight cities, them and their suburbs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And as for the cities which ye shall give out of
  the possession of the children of Israel, from those that have much ye shall
  give much, and from those that have less ye shall give less: they shall give
  of their cities to the Levites each one according to his inheritance which
  they shall inherit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord spoke
  to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Speak to the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye are to cross over Jordan
  into the land of Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And ye
  shall appoint to yourselves cities: they shall be to you cities of refuge for
  the slayer to flee to, every one who has killed another unintentionally.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the cities shall be to you places
  of refuge from the avenger of blood, and the slayer shall not die until he
  stands before the congregation for judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the cities which ye shall assign, even the
  six cities, shall be places of refuge for you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ye shall assign three cities on the other side of
  Jordan, and ye shall assign three cities in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> It shall be a place of refuge for the children of
  Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that sojourns among you; these
  cities shall be for a place of refuge, for every one to flee thither who has
  killed a man unintentionally. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if
  he should smite him with an iron instrument, and the man should die, he is a
  murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if he should smite him with a stone thrown
  from his hand, whereby a man may die, and he thus die, he is a murderer; let
  the murderer by all means be put to death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if he should smite him with an instrument of
  wood from his hand, whereby he may die, and he thus die, he is a murderer;
  let the murderer by all means be put to death. <span style=

  murderer: whensoever he shall meet him he shall slay him. <span style=

  cast any thing upon him from an ambuscade, and the man should die,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> or if he have smitten him with his
  hand through anger, and the man should die, let the man that smote him be put
  to death by all means, he is a murderer: let the murderer by all means be put
  to death: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meets him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But if he should thrust him suddenly,
  not through enmity, or cast any thing upon him, not from an ambuscade,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> or smite him with any stone, whereby
  a man may die, unawares, and it should fall upon him, and he should die, but
  he was not his enemy, nor sought to hurt him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> then the assembly shall judge between the smiter
  and the avenger of blood, according to these judgments. <span style=

  refuge, whither he fled for refuge; and he shall dwell there till the death
  of the high-priest, whom they anointed with the holy oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But if the slayer should in any wise go out
  beyond the bounds of the city whither he fled for refuge, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and the avenger of blood should find him without
  the bounds of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood should kill
  the slayer, he is not guilty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For he
  ought to have remained in the city of refuge till the high-priest died; and
  after the death of the high-priest the slayer shall return to the land of his
  possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And these things shall be
  to you for an ordinance of judgment throughout your generations in all your
  dwellings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Whoever kills a man, thou
  shalt slay the murderer on the testimony of witnesses; and one witness shall
  not testify against a soul that he should die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And ye shall not accept ransoms for life from a
  murderer who is worthy of death, for he shall be surely put to death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Ye shall not accept a ransom to
  excuse his fleeing to the city of refuge, so that he should again dwell in
  the land, until the death of the high-priest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> So shall ye not pollute with murder the land in
  which ye dwell; for this blood pollutes the land, and the land shall not be
  purged from the blood shed upon it, but by the blood of him that shed it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And ye shall not defile the land
  whereon ye dwell, on which I dwell in the midst of you; for I am the Lord
  dwelling in the midst of the children of Israel.

  the families of the children of Israel: <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This is the thing which the Lord has appointed the
  daughters of Salpaad, saying, Let them marry where they please, only let them
  marry men of their father’s tribe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> So
  shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel go about from tribe to
  tribe, for the children of Israel shall steadfastly continue each in the
  inheritance of his family’s tribe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  whatever daughter is heiress to a property of the tribes of the children
  Israel, such women shall be married each to one of her father’s tribe, that
  the sons of Israel may each inherit the property of his father’s tribe.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the inheritance shall not go about
  from one tribe to another, but the children of Israel shall steadfastly
  continue each in his own inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  As the Lord commanded Moses, so did they to the daughters of Salpaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> So Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and
  Nua, and Malaa, the daughters of Salpaad, married their cousins; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> they were married to men of the tribe of Manasse
  of the sons of Joseph; and their inheritance was attached to the tribe of
  their father’s family. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> These are the
  commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded
  by the hand of Moses, at the west of Moab, at Jordan by Jericho.
