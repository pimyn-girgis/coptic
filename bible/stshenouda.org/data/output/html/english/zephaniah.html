  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The word of the Lord which came to
  Sophonias the son of Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amorias, the son
  of Ezekias, in the days of Josias son of Amon, king of Juda. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let there be an utter cutting off from the face of
  the land, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let man and
  cattle be cut off; let the birds of the air and the fishes of the sea be cut
  off; and the ungodly shall fail, and I will take away the transgressors from
  the face of the land, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And I will stretch out mine hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of
  Jerusalem; and I will remove the names of Baal out of this place, and the
  names of the priests; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and them that
  worship the host of heaven upon the house-tops; and them that worship and
  swear by the Lord, and them that swear by their king; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and them that turn aside from the Lord, and them
  that seek not the Lord, and them that cleave not to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Fear ye before the Lord God; for the day of the
  Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared his sacrifice, and has sanctified his
  guests. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it shall come to pass in
  the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will take vengeance on the princes,
  and on the king’s house, and upon all that wear strange apparel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will openly take vengeance on the porches in
  that day, on the men that fill the house of the Lord their God with
  ungodliness and deceit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there
  shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the sound of a cry from the gate of men
  slaying, and a howling from the second gate, and a great crashing from the
  hills. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Lament, ye that inhabit the
  city that has been broken down, for all the people has become like Chanaan;
  and all that were exalted by silver have been utterly destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I
  will search Jerusalem with a candle, and will take vengeance on the men that
  despise the things committed to them; but they say in their hearts, The Lord
  will not do any good, neither will he do any evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And their power shall be for a spoil, and their
  houses for utter desolation; and they shall build houses, but shall not dwell
  in them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine of
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the great day of the Lord
  is near, it is near, and very speedy; the sound of the day of the Lord is
  made bitter and harsh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> A mighty day
  of wrath is that day, a day of affliction and distress, a day of desolation
  and destruction, a day of gloominess and darkness, a day of cloud and vapour,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> a day of the trumpet and cry against
  the strong cities, and against the high towers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will greatly afflict the men, and they
  shall walk as blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; therefore
  he shall pour out their blood as dust, and their flesh as dung. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And their silver and their gold shall in nowise
  be able to rescue them in the day of the Lord’s wrath; but the whole land
  shall be devoured by the fire of his jealously; for he will bring a speedy
  destruction on all them that inhabit the land.</p>

  <h3 id="zephaniah2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Be ye gathered and closely joined
  together, O unchastened nation; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> before
  ye become as the flower that passes away, before the anger of the Lord come
  upon you, before the day of the wrath of the Lord come upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth; do
  judgment, and seek justice, and answer accordingly; that ye may be hid in the
  day of the wrath of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For Gaza
  shall be utterly spoiled, and Ascalon shall be destroyed; and Azotus shall be
  cast forth at noon-day, and Accaron shall be rooted up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Woe to them that dwell on the border of the sea,
  neighbours of the Cretans! the word of the Lord is against you, O Chanaan,
  land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you out of your dwelling-place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Crete shall be a pasture of
  flocks, and a fold of sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  sea cost shall be for the remnant of the house of Juda; they shall pasture
  upon them in the houses of Ascalon; they shall rest in the evening because of
  the children of Juda; for the Lord their God has visited them, and he will
  turn away their captivity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I have
  heard the revilings of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon,
  wherewith they have reviled my people, and magnified themselves against my
  coasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore, as I live, saith
  the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodoma, and the
  children of Ammon as Gomorrha; and Damascus shall be left as a heap of the
  threshing-floor, and desolate for ever: and the remnant of my people shall
  plunder them, and the remnant of my nations shall inherit them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> This is their punishment in return for their
  haughtiness, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against
  the Lord Almighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Lord shall
  appear against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of
  the earth; and they shall worship him every one from his place, even all the
  islands of the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ye Ethiopians
  also are the slain of my sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  he shall stretch forth his hand against the north and destroy the Assyrian,
  and make Nineve a dry wilderness, even as a desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And flocks, and all the wild beasts of the land,
  and chameleons shall feed in the midst thereof: and hedgehogs shall lodge in
  the ceilings thereof; and wild beasts shall cry in the breaches thereof, and
  ravens in her porches, whereas her loftiness was as as cedar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3:1)</span> This is the scornful city that dwells securely,
  that says in her heart, I am, and there is no longer any to be after me: how
  is she become desolate, a habitation of wild beasts! every one that passes
  through her shall hiss, and shake his hands.</p>

  <h3 id="zephaniah3">3</h3>

  <p>Alas the glorious and ransomed city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The dove hearkened not to the voice; she received
  not correction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Her princes within her were as
  roaring lions, her judges as the wolves of Arabia; they remained not till the
  morrow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Her prophets are light and
  scornful men: her priests profane the holy things, and sinfully transgress
  the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the just Lord is in the
  midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he
  will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows
  not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I have brought down the proud with destruction;
  their corners are destroyed: I will make their ways completely waste, so that
  none shall go through: their cities are come to an end, by reason of no man
  living or dwelling in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I said,
  But do ye fear me, and receive instruction, and ye shall not be cut off from
  the face of the land for all the vengeance I have brought upon her: prepare
  thou, rise early: all their produce is spoilt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore wait upon me, saith the Lord, until the
  day when I rise up for a witness: because my judgment shall be on the
  gatherings of the nations, to draw to me kings, to pour out upon them all my
  fierce anger: for the whole earth shall be consumed with the fire of my
  jealousy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For then will I turn to the
  peoples a tongue for her generation, that all may call on the name of the
  Lord, to serve him under one yoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  From the boundaries of the rivers of Ethiopia will I receive my dispersed
  ones; they shall offer sacrifices to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In that day thou shalt not be ashamed of all thy
  practices, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then will I take
  away from thee thy disdainful pride, and thou shalt no more magnify thyself
  upon my holy mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will
  leave in thee a meek and lowly people; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and the remnant of Israel shall fear the name of
  the Lord, and shall do no iniquity, neither shall they speak vanity; neither
  shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and
  lie down, and there shall be none to terrify them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Rejoice, O daughter of Sion; cry aloud, O
  daughter of Jerusalem; rejoice and delight thyself with all thine heart, O
  daughter of Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The Lord has
  taken away thine iniquities, he has ransomed thee from the hand of thine
  enemies: the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt
  not see evil any more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> At that time
  the Lord shall say to Jerusalem, Be of good courage, Sion; let not thine
  hands be slack. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The Lord thy God is
  in thee; the Mighty One shall save thee: he shall bring joy upon thee, and
  shall refresh thee with his love; and he shall rejoice over thee with delight
  as in a day of feasting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I will
  gather thine afflicted ones. Alas! who has taken up a reproach against her?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Behold, I will work in thee for thy
  sake at that time, saith the Lord: and I will save her that was oppressed,
  and receive her that was rejected; and I will make them a praise, and
  honoured in all the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And their
  enemies shall be ashamed at that time, when I shall deal well with you, and
  at the time when I shall receive you: for I will make you honoured and a
  praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn back your captivity
  before you, saith the Lord.</p>
