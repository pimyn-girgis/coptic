  The birth-book of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraam.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Abraam begat Isaac; and Isaac
  begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brothers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Judas begat Phares and Zara from Tamar; and
  Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat
  Nasson; and Nasson begat Salmon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  Salmon begat Boes from Rechab; and Boes begat Jubed; and Jubed begat Jesse.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Jesse begat David, and David begat
  Solomon from the wife of Urias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asaph.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Asaph begat Josaphat; and Josaphat
  begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Ezekias begat Manasse; and
  Manasse begat Amos; and Amos begat Josias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, at
  the time of the migration to Babylon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  After the migration to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel
  begat Zorobabel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Zorobabel begat
  Abiud: and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Azor begat Sadok; and Sadok begat Achin; and
  Achin begat Eliud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Eliud begat
  Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthewthan; and Matthewthan begat Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of
  Mary, who bare Jesus who is called Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> All the generations from Abraam to David are
  fourteen generations; and from David to the migration to Babylon fourteen
  generations; and from the migration to Babylon to Christ fourteen
  generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The birth of Jesus
  Christ was thus: Mary his mother having been betrothed to Joseph, before they
  knew each other she was found with child from the Holy Spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Joseph her husband was righteous, and not
  wishing to make her a public example, he intended to put her away secretly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he having thought about these
  things, behold an angel of the Lord manifested himself to Joseph in a dream,
  saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary, thy wife: for he
  whom she will bear is from the Holy Spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And she shall bear a son; thou shalt call his
  name "Jesus;" for he will save his people from their sins.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And all this happened that it might be fulfilled
  which, the Lord said by the prophet, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear
  a son, they shall call his name "Emmanuel," which 'is interpreted "God with
  us."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Joseph having risen from
  the sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and he took to him
  Mary his wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he knew her not
  until she bare the son; and he called his name Jesus.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
  king, behold Magi came from the east to Jerusalem, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> saying: 'Where is he who is born king of the Jews?
  for we saw his star in the east, we are come that we may worship him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And king Herod, having heard, was
  troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And having assembled all the chief-priests and the scribes of the people, he
  was asking of them 'where will Christ be born?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judea: for
  thus is written by the prophet <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  thou Bethlehem, land of Juda, thou art not little among the princedoms of
  Juda: for from thee shall come a governor who will rule my people Israel."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then Herod called the Magi secretly,
  he enquired from them about the time of the star which appeared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying: Go, ask
  carefully concerning the child. And if ye find him, tell me that I may come
  also and worship him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they,
  having obeyed the king, went. And behold, the star which they saw in the
  east, was going before them, until it came and stood over the place in which
  the child was. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And having seen the
  star, they rejoiced with very great joy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And having come to the house they saw the child
  with Mary his mother; and having thrown themselves down they worshipped him;
  and having opened their treasures they offered him gifts, gold and
  frankincense and myrrh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And having
  been told in a dream not to return to Herod, by another road they went to
  their country. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they having gone,
  Behold, and angel of the Lord manifested to Joseph in a dream, saying:
  'Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be there until
  I tell thee: for Herod will seek for the child to destroy him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he arose, he took the child and his mother by
  night, and went to Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he was
  there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which. the Lord
  said by the prophet, saying: 'I called my son from Egypt.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then Herod having seen that the Magi mocked him,
  was very angry, and he sent, he slew every child that was in Bethlehem and in
  all her boundaries, from two years old and under, according to the time which
  he enquired from the Magi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Then was
  fulfilled that which he said by Jeremias the prophet, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> A voice was heard in Rama, Rachel weeping for her
  sons; and would not be comforted, because they are not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Herod having died, behold, an angel of the
  Lord manifested himself to Joseph in a dream in Egypt, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to
  the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought for the life of the child.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he, having arisen, took the child
  and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And having heard that Archelaos is king of Judea
  instead of Herod his father, he feared to go thither; and having been told in
  a dream, he went to the parts of Galilee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he came, he dwelt in a city called
  'Nazareth:' that it might be fulfilled which he said by his prophets: 'He
  shall be called "the Nazarene." '
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the desert of Judea,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> saying: 'Repent; for the kingdom of
  the heavens is come near. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For this is
  he of whom, he spake by Esaias the prophet, saying: "The voice of him who
  crieth in the desert: 'Prepare the road of the Lord, make straight his
  paths.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he, John, his raiment was
  of camel's hair, and he was girt with a girdle of skin upon his loins, and
  his food was locust and honey of the field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Then came forth to him the people of Jerusalem,
  and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and were baptized by him in the river Jordan,
  confessing their sins <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And having seen
  a multitude of the Pharisees and the Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said
  to them: 'Offspring of vipers, who told you to flee from the anger which
  cometh? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Bring forth therefore fruit
  worthy of repentance; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and think not in
  yourselves to say: " We have our father Abraam; " for I say unto you: " God
  has power to raise up from these stones sons unto Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The axe is now at the root of the trees: every
  tree which will not bring forth good fruit will be cut down, and cast into
  the fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For I indeed baptize you
  with water to repentance: but he who cometh after me is stronger than I,
  whose shoe I am not worthy to carry: he shall baptize you with [the] Holy
  Spirit and fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he--his fan in
  his hand--will cleanse his floor; and will gather his wheat into the garner,
  but will burn the chaff with fire unquenchable." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then came Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan to
  John, to be baptized by him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And John
  was forbidding him, saying: I have need to be baptized by thee, and thou
  comest to me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Jesus answered, he
  said to him: Permit it now: thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.'
  Then he permitted him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And having
  been baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and lo, the heavens
  opened to him, and he saw a Spirit of God coming down as a dove, coming to
  him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and lo, there was a voice from
  the heavens, saying: This is my Son, my Beloved in whom I am well pleased.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Then Jesus--the Spirit took him away to (the) desert for the devil to tempt
  him,. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And having fasted forty days and
  forty nights, at last he hungered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the tempter came, he said to him: If thou be (the) Son of God, command that
  these stones become bread.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he
  answered, he said to him: It is written, that the man was not to live by
  bread alone, but upon every word which cometh from the mouth of God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Then the devil took him away to the
  holy city, and made him, stand upon (the) wing of the temple; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and said to him: If thou be the Son of God, throw
  thyself down from here: for it is written, that he will order his angels
  concerning thee, and they shall bear thee upon their hands, lest haply thou
  dash against a stone thy foot.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Jesus
  answered him: It is written again, that thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Again, the devil took him away
  up to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and
  their glory: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and said to him: All
  these I will give thee, if thou shouldst throw thyself down and worship me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then said Jesus to him: Go, Satan;
  for it is written, that the Lord thy God is he whom thou shalt worship, and
  he alone whom thou shalt serve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then
  the devil left him, and lo, angels came and ministered to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Now having heard that John was delivered (up), he
  went to Galilee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and he left
  Nazareth; he came, he dwelt in Kapharnaum, which is by (the) sea, in the
  boundaries of Zabulon and Nephthalim <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  That it might be fulfilled which he said by Esaias the prophet, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> (The) land of Zabulon and (the) land
  of Nephthalim, the road of (the) sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> the people who sit in (the) darkness
  saw a great light, and upon them who sit in (the) region and (the) shadow of
  death light sprang up.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> From that
  time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of the
  heavens approached.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And walking by
  the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called 'Peter,' and
  Andrew his brother, throwing a net into (the) sea, for they were fishers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he said to them: Come, walk after
  me, that I may make you fishers, catchers of men.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they immediately left their nets, and walked
  after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And having passed on from
  there, he saw two other brothers, James, son of Zebedee, and John his
  brother, being on the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and
  he called them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they immediately
  left the ship and Zebedee their father, they walked after him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus was going about in all Galilee,
  teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
  healing every sickness which was among the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And his fame went forth in all Syria, and they
  brought to him all who were afflicted with their sicknesses and their pains
  in many ways, them with whom were the demons, and them who were epileptic,
  and them who were paralysed, and he healed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And great multitudes walked after him from
  Galilee and the ten cities and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And having seen the multitudes he went up upon the mountain; and having sat
  down his disciples came to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  having opened his mouth he was teaching them, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Blessed are the poor of spirit, because theirs is
  the kingdom of the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Blessed
  are they who mourn now, because they will be comforted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Blessed are they who hunger
  and they who thirst after righteousness, because they will be satisfied.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Blessed are the pitiful, because they
  will be pitied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Blessed are they who
  are pure in their heart, because they will see God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be
  called "the sons of God." <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Blessed are
  they who were persecuted because of righteousness, because theirs is the
  kingdom of the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Blessed are
  ye if they should persecute you and revile you and say all evil at you,
  speaking falsely against you because of me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great
  in the heavens. For thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And ye (are the) salt of the earth,
  but if the salt have lost its savour, with what shall it be salted? it is no
  longer good for anything, but to be cast out, and trodden upon by men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ye are (the) light of the world: it
  is not possible that a city be hid, being set upon a mountain; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> nor do they light a lamp and put it under a,
  measure, but they put it on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to every one
  who is in the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thus let your
  light give light before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
  your Father who is in the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to
  destroy them, but to fulfil them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For
  verily I say to you, that until (the) heaven and (the) earth pass away, an
  iota or a point shall not pass away from the law until all these things be
  accomplished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He, then, who will
  destroy one of these little commandments, and teach men thus, shall be called
  "the little in the kingdom of the heavens." But he who will do and teach,
  this (one) shall be called" great in the kingdom of the heavens."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For I say to you, that unless your
  righteousness exceed that of the scribes and the 'Pharisees, ye shall not
  come into the kingdom of the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Ye hear that it was said to them of old time: "Thou shalt not kill; and he
  who will kill shall be in danger of the judgement." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But I say to you, that every one who will be
  angry with his brother without cause shall be in danger of the judgement. He
  who will say to his brother "Raka" shall be in danger of the council. And he
  who will say to his brother "[the] fool" shall be in danger of the Geenna of
  the fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If, then, thou wilt offer
  up thy gift upon the altar, and remember there that willthere is a quarrel
  between thee and thy brother <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Leave
  there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
  brother, and then come and offer thy gift. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou
  art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
  judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
  prison. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Verily I say unto thee, Thou
  shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
  farthing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Ye have heard that it was
  said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a
  woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
  heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if thy right eye offend
  thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that
  one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast
  into hell. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And if thy right hand
  offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee
  that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
  cast into hell. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> It hath been said,
  Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But I say unto you, That whosoever
  shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to
  commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth
  adultery. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Again, ye have heard that
  it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but
  shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by
  heaven; for it is God’s throne: <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Nor
  by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the
  city of the great King. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Neither shalt
  thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But let your communication be, Yea,
  yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for
  an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But
  I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on
  thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take
  away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go
  with him twain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Give to him that
  asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Ye have heard that it hath been said,
  Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them
  that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
  despitefully use you, and persecute you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> That ye may be the children of your Father which
  is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
  sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> For if ye love them which love you, what reward
  have ye? do not even the publicans the same? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye
  more than others? do not even the publicans so? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
  which is in heaven is perfect.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And give heed to your gift: do it not before [the] men to cause them to see
  you: (thus) ye have no reward from your Father who is in the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> If then thou wilt do alms, sound not a
  trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and the market
  places that men may glorify them. Verily I say to you, that they have already
  received their reward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But thou going
  to do alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that thine alms may be in secret: and
  thy Father who seeth in secret shall give to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And if ye will pray, ye shall not be as the
  hypocrites; because they love to stand in the synagogues and the corners of
  the streets and pray, that they may appear to men. Verily I say to you, that
  they have already received their reward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But thou going to pray, go into thy chamber; shut
  thy door upon thee, and pray to thy Father in secret: and thy Father who
  seeth in secret shall give to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And ye going to pray, do not make a multitude of words as the Gentiles. For
  they think that they will be heard in their multitude of words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Be not then like to them: for your Father knoweth
  the things which ye have need of before ye pray him concerning them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Pray ye then thus. Our Father who art
  in the heavens, hallowed be thy name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done as in (the) heaven so upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Give us our bread of to-morrow
  to-day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And forgive us our debts as
  we also forgive our debtors. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  bring us not into temptation: but save us from the evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if ye forgive [the] men their trespasses your
  Father who is in the heavens shall forgive your trespasses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But if ye do not forgive [the] men, neither will
  your Father forgive you your trespasses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if ye fast ye shall not be as the hypocrites,
  who make sad their face: for they disfigure their faces that they may appear
  to [the] men (as) fasting. Verily I say to you, that they have already
  received their reward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But thou,
  fasting, anoint thy head and wash thy face; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> that thou appear not to [the] men (as) fasting,
  but (to) thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret
  shall reward thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Throw not in for
  yourselves treasures upon the earth, where (the) rust and (the) moth destroy
  them, and where the thieves break through for them and steal them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But throw in for yourselves treasures
  in (the) heaven, where neither rust nor moth destroy them, and the thieves
  break not through for them and steal them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For the place in which thy treasure is, there
  shall be thy heart also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> (The) lamp
  of the body is the eye: if then thine eye is single, thy whole body shall be
  shining. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But if thine eye is evil,
  thy whole body shall be dark. If then the light which is in thee is darkness,
  how great the darkness? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> It is not
  possible that any man should serve two lords: for either (it is) that he
  hates one, and loves one; or that he accepts one, and despises the other. It
  is not possible for you to serve God and mamon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore I say to you: "Do not take care about
  your life: viz. what will ye eat or what will ye drink: nor about your body:
  viz. with what will ye clothe yourselves." Is not the life better than the
  food, and the body than the raiment? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Consider the birds of (the) heaven that they sow not, nor reap, nor put into
  barn; and your Father who is in the heavens feedeth them. Are not ye much
  better than they? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And for which of
  you by taking care is it possible to add (lit. put upon) a cubit to his
  stature? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And why take ye care for
  raiment? consider the flowers of (the) field how they grow, they toil not,
  nor spin: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and I say to you, that even
  Solomon in all his glory was not clothed as one of these. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And if God thus robes the grass of (the) field
  (which) to-day is and to-morrow they <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
  drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> (For after all these things do the Gentiles
  seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But seek ye first the kingdom
  of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Take therefore no thought for the
  morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
  Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Judge not, that ye may not be judged: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  for ye are to be judged with the judgement which ye will give: and in the
  measure which ye will measure, it is to be measured to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Wherefore seest thou the mote in thy brother's
  eye; and the beam which is in thine eye thou considerest it not?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother:
  "Let me cast the mote from thine eye;" and behold the beam is in thine eye?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Hypocrite, first cast the beam from
  thine eye; and then thou shalt see clearly to cast the mote from thy
  brother's eye. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Give not the holy to
  the dogs: nor cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample on
  them with their feet, and turn and rend you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall
  find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For every one who asketh receiveth; and he who
  seeketh findeth; and to him who knocketh they open. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Or what man who is among you, whose son will ask
  him for a loaf, will he give him a stone? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Or who will ask him for a fish, will he give him
  a serpent? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If then ye being evil,
  know how to give the good gifts to your sons, how much more then shall your
  Father which is in the heavens give the good things to those who will ask
  him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And all things which ye wish
  that men should do to you, do ye also thus to them; for this is the law and
  the prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Enter by the narrow
  gate; because wide is the gate and broad is the road which leadeth to
  destruction; and many are they who will go in by it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Because narrow is the gate and straitened is the
  road which leadeth to (the) life; and few will find it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And beware of the false prophets who come to you
  in sheep's raiment: but inside of them they are ravening wolves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> By their fruits ye shall know them. Do they
  gather grapes off thorns; or do they gather figs off the thistles?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thus every good tree bringeth forth
  good fruit; and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> It is not possible for a good tree to produce
  evil fruit; nor an evil tree to produce good fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Every tree which will not produce a good fruit
  will be cut down and cast to the fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> So then by their fruits ye shall know them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Not every one who saith to me, "Lord,
  Lord," will come into the kingdom of the heavens: but he who doeth the will
  of my Father who is in the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  For there will be many saying to me in that day: "Lord, Lord, prophesied we
  not in thy name? and in thy name cast out devils? and in thy name did many
  mighty works?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And then I shall
  profess unto them: "I never knew you; go from me, [the] workers of iniquity."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Every one, then, who heareth these my
  words, and (is) doing them, I shall liken him to a wise man, who built his
  house upon the rock. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the rain
  came down; the rivers came and struck that house, and it fell not; for its
  foundation was established upon the rock. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And every one who heareth these my words, and
  (is) doing them not, I shall liken him to a foolish man, this (one) who built
  his house upon the sand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the rain
  descended; the rivers came; the winds blew; they struck that house, and it
  fell; and its fall was great.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it
  came to pass (that), Jesus having finished these words, the multitudes were
  wondering at his teaching: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> for he was
  teaching them as having authority, and not as their scribes.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And having come down from upon the mountain, great multitudes walked after
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And lo, a leper came to him: he
  worshipped him, saying: My Lord, if thou shouldst wish, it is possible for
  thee to cleanse me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And having
  stretched out his hand, he touched him, saying: I wish, be cleansed.' And
  immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And Jesus said to him: 'See, tell it not to any one, but go shew thyself to
  the priest, and offer thy gift which Moses commanded for a witness to them.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having come into Capernaum a
  centurion came to him, beseeching him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  saying: My Lord, my servant (lit. child) lieth in my house being paralysed
  and afflicted greatly.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to
  him: 'I will come and heal him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  the centurion answered, he said: My Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst
  come in under (the) roof of my house. But only say with (the) word and my
  servant (lit. child) shall be cured. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  For I also am a man set under authority, having (lit. being) soldiers under
  me: if I should say to this (one), "Go," he goeth; another, "Come," he
  cometh; and my servant," Do this," he doeth it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Jesus having heard, wondered, and said to
  them who were walking after him: Verily I say to you that I found not faith
  of this degree from any in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And I say to you that many shall come from [the] east and (the) west, and
  shall sit down to meat with Abram and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the
  heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the sons of the kingdom
  shall be cast out to the outer darkness, the place in which will be (the)
  weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Jesus said to the centurion, Go: as thou
  believedst, it shall be done to thee.' And the servant (lit. child) was cured
  in that hour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jesus having come
  into (the) house of Peter, saw his wife's mother lying, and sick of a fever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He touched her hand, and the fever
  left her, and she arose and ministered to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And evening having come, they brought to him
  multitudes having (lit. being) demons with them, and he was casting out the
  spirits with (the) word, and he healed all who were afflicted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> That it might be fulfilled which he spake by
  Esaias the prophet, saying: He took our sicknesses, and carried our
  diseases.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jesus having seen the
  multitudes who were around him, commanded to go across. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And a scribe having come to him, said to him:
  Teacher, let me walk after thee whither thou wentest.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and
  the birds of (the) heaven have nests; but (the) Son of (the) man hath not
  where to lay his head.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And another
  of his disciples said to him: My Lord, give me authority first to go and bury
  my father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Jesus said to him:
  Walk after me; and leave the dead, let them bury their dead.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And (he) having entered into (the) ship, his
  disciples walked after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And lo,
  there was a great storm in (the) sea, so that the waves covered the ship. And
  he was sleeping. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they woke him,
  saying: Lord, save us; we shall perish.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he said to them: Wherefore are ye doubtful,
  (ye) of [the] little faith?'Then having risen he rebuked the winds and (the)
  sea; and there was a great calm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And
  the men were wondering, saying: What manner (of man) is this, because the
  winds and (the) sea obey him!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  having come across to (the) country of (the) Gergesenes, two men came out to
  meet him having (lit. being) the demons with them, coming out of the
  sepulchres, very fierce so that no one could pass by that way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And lo, they cried out, saying: What (hast) thou
  with us, Son of God? Camest thou hither to destroy us before that it is our
  time?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And there was a herd of many
  swine at a distance from them feeding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the demons were beseeching him, saying: If
  thou wilt cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he said to them: Go.' And they having come
  out, went into the swine. And behold the whole herd of swine went with a rush
  by the precipice down to (the) sea, and they died in the waters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they who fed them fled; and having gone to
  the city they told them everything, and concerning them who [had] the demons
  with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And lo, the whole city
  came out to meet Jesus. And having seen him, they were beseeching him that he
  should go away from their boundaries.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  And having entered into (the) ship he came across; he came into his city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And lo, they brought to him one
  paralysed and prostrate upon a bed, and Jesus having seen their faith, said
  to him who was paralysed: 'Be of good cheer, my son; thy sins are forgiven
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And lo, some of the scribes
  said within themselves: This (man) blasphemeth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus having seen their thoughts said:
  Wherefore think ye evil things in your hearts? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For what is easy to say: "Thy sins are forgiven
  thee;" or to say: "Rise, and walk?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  But that ye may know that (the) Son of (the) man hath authority to forgive
  sin upon the earth;'then he said to him who was paralysed: 'Rise, take up thy
  bed, and go to thy house.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he
  arose, he went to his house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the
  multitudes having seen, feared: and they glorified God, who gave authority
  thus to [the] men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Jesus passed
  from there, he saw a man sitting at a custom-house, whose name is Matthew;
  and he said to him: Walk after me.' And he arose, he walked after him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And (as he is) sitting at meat in
  (the) house of Simon, lo, publicans came, they sat down to meat with Jesus
  and his disciples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Pharisees
  having seen, were saying to his disciples: Wherefore eateth your Teacher with
  the publicans and the sinners?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But
  Jesus having heard, said to them: They who are strong have not need of the
  physician, but they who are diseased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  But go, learn what it is--pity I wish for, and not sacrifice: for I came not
  to invite the righteous, but the sinners.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying:
  'Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast many (times), but thy disciples--they
  fast not?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Jesus said to them: Is
  it possible for the sons of the bridegroom to mourn while the bridegroom is
  with them? but days come whenever the bridegroom shall be taken from them:
  then they shall fast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> No one taketh
  up a piece of new cloth and putteth it on a torn garment; for (the new cloth)
  draweth away its filling up from the garment, and a rent becometh greater.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Neither do they put new wine into old
  bottles: otherwise the bottles are rent, and the wine is poured out, and the
  bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and they support one
  another.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And (as he is) saying these
  (things), lo, a ruler came, he worshipped him, saying:'My daughter died now:
  but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Jesus arose, he walked after him and his
  disciples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And lo, a woman, having an
  issue of blood twelve years, came forth behind him, she touched (the) hem of
  his garment: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for she said in herself:
  I should only touch (the) hem of his garment, I shall be saved.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Jesus having turned himself and having seen
  her, said: Be of good cheer, my daughter; thy faith saved thee.' And the
  woman was cured from that hour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  Jesus having come into (the) house of the ruler, saw the singers, and the
  multitudes making a tumult. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> [For] he
  was saying: Come from there; for the child died not, but slept.' And they
  were mocking him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But when he (had)
  put forth the multitude, he went in, he laid hold on her hand, and the child
  arose. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And her fame went out over all
  that land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Jesus coming from
  there, two blind men walked after him, crying out, saying: Pity us, Son of
  David.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And (he) having come into the
  house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them: Believe ye that it
  is possible for me to do this? They said to him: Yea, our Lord.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Then he touched their eyes, saying: 'According to
  your faith it shall be done to you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And their eyes opened: and Jesus ordered them, saying: See! let no one know
  (it).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But they having come out,
  spread his fame abroad in all that land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And (as he is) coming from there, lo, they
  brought to him a dumb (man) having (lit. being) a demon with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And (he) having cast out the demon,
  the dumb spake: and the multitudes were wondering, saying: 'Nothing ever
  appeared (lit. manifested him) thus in Israel.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But the Pharisees were saying, that by (lit. in)
  (the) ruler of the demons he cast out the demons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Jesus was going round all the cities and the
  villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the
  kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But having seen the multitudes he had compassion
  upon them, because they were going astray and were being scattered as sheep
  not having a shepherd. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Then he said
  to his disciples The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Pray, then, (the) Lord of the harvest
  that he send labourers forth to his harvest.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew10">10</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having called the twelve disciples, he gave
  authority to them over the unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal
  every sickness and every disease. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Now
  the names (lit. name) of the twelve apostles are these: the first is Simon,
  who is called Peter,' and Andrew his brother; James (the) son of Zebedee, and
  John his brother; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Philip, and
  Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James (the) son of Alphaeus,
  and Thaddaeus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Simon the Cananaean,
  and Judas Iscariot, who will deliver him (up). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> These (lit, the) twelve Jesus sent, having ordered
  them, saying: Go not to (the) road of the Gentiles, nor enter city of the
  Samaritans. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But go ye rather to the
  stray sheep of (the) house of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And (as ye are) walking, preach, saying that the kingdom of the heavens
  approached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Them who are sick, heal;
  the dead, raise; the lepers, cleanse; the demons, cast out: ye received
  freely, give freely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Put not gold for
  you, nor silver, nor brass in your girdles; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> nor (take) scrip for you on (the) road, nor two
  coats, nor shoe, nor staff: for the labourer is worthy of his food.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the city which ye will go into or
  the village,--ask in it who is worthy; and abide there until ye go thence.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Being about to go into the house
  salute it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if indeed the house is
  worthy of your peace, it shall come upon it; but if it is not worthy, your
  peace shall return to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he who
  will not receive you to him, and who will not hearken to your words, coming
  out of the house or that city or the village, shake off (the) dust of your
  feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Verily I say to you, that they
  shall spare (the) land of Sodom and Gomorra in the day of the judgement than
  that city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Lo, I send you as sheep in
  (the) midst of wolves: become, then, wise as the serpents, but harmless as
  the doves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But beware of [the] men:
  for they will deliver you to councils, and they will scourge you in their
  synagogues; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and they shall bring you
  to the kings and the governors because of me, for a witness to them and the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But if they should deliver
  you (up) take no care either how or what ye will say: for it will be given
  you in that day whit ye will speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  For it is not ye who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father which will
  speak in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And brother shall
  deliver brother to (the) death, and father shall deliver (up) son: and sons,
  rising upon their fathers, shall kill them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And ye shall become hated by all because of my
  name: but he who will hold on until the end (lit. out), this (one) will be
  saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But if they should persecute
  you in this city, flee to another: verily I say to you, that ye shall not
  attain to pass through the cities of Israel, until (the) Son of (the) man
  come. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A disciple is not greater than
  his teacher, nor a servant greater than his lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> It is sufficient for the disciple that he be as
  his teacher, and the servant that he be as his lord. If they called the owner
  of the house "Belzeboul," how much more (shall they call) his household?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Fear not then them: for there is not
  that which is covered, (except) that it will be revealed; nor hidden,
  (except) that it will be known. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> That
  which I say to you in darkness, say in light: and that which ye hear in your
  ears, preach upon your housetops. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  fear not him who will kill your body, while it is not possible for them to
  kill your soul: but fear that one for whom it is possible to destroy the soul
  and the body in the Geenna. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Are not
  two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall upon the
  earth without the will of your Father who is in the heavens: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Fear not, then, for ye are better
  than many sparrows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Every one who
  will confess me before men, I shall confess him also before my Father who is
  in the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But he who will deny
  me before men, I shall deny him also before my Father who is in the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Think not that I came to send (lit.
  cast) peace on the earth: I came not to send (lit. cast) peace, but a sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> For I came to set a man at variance
  against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law
  against her mother-in-law: <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> and the
  man's foes are his household. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> He who
  loveth his father or his mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who
  loveth his son or his daughter more than me is not worthy of me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> He who will not take up his cross and walk after
  me, is not worthy of me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> He who found
  his life shall lose it; he who will lose his life because of me shall find
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> He who receiveth you, received
  me, and he who receiveth me received him who sent me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> He who receiveth a prophet in the name of a
  prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receiveth a righteous
  (man) in the name of a righteous (man) shall receive a righteous (man's)
  reward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he who will give to drink
  to one of these little (ones) a cup of cold water only, in (the) name of a
  disciple, verily I say to you, that his reward shall not perish.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew11">11</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass (that) Jesus having finished
  commanding his twelve disciples went away from there to teach and preach in
  their cities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Now John having heard,
  being in the prison, concerning the works of Christ, sent two of his
  disciples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He said to him: Art thou he
  who cometh, or look we for another?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And Jesus having answered, said to them: Go, tell John the things which ye
  see and the' things which ye hear: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
  the dead rise, the poor have good tidings preached to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And blessed is he who will not be offended in me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And these being about to go, Jesus
  began to say to the multitudes concerning John:'What came ye out to the
  wilderness to see? a reed--the wind shaking it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But what came ye out to see? a man clothed (lit.
  being) in soft clothes? Behold, those with soft garments are in the houses of
  the kings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But wherefore came ye out?
  to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, more than a prophet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For this is he concerning whom it is written:
  "Lo, I will send (the) messenger before thee, and he shall prepare in front
  of thee." <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Verily, I say to you, that
  no one rose among them that are born of women greater than John the Baptist;
  but the lesser than he in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And from the days of John the Baptist
  until now the kingdom of the heavens suffereth violence, and (the) violent
  take it by force. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For all the
  prophets and the law prophesied until John. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if ye wish to receive him, he is Elias who
  cometh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He who hath an ear to hear,
  let him hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But to whom am I to
  liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the market-places,
  these who call to one another, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  saying, "We sang to you, and ye danced not; we wept, and ye wailed not."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For John came, not eating and not
  drinking; they said that there is a demon with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And (the) Son of (the) man came eating and
  drinking; they said: "Lo, a man gluttonous and (a) winebibber, (he) is (the)
  friend of the publicans and the sinners!" And [the] wisdom was justified from
  her works.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Then he began to upbraid
  the cities in which most of his mighty works were done, and they repented
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Woe to thee, Chorazin woe to
  thee, Bethsaida! because if these mighty works (had) been done in Tyre and
  Sidon which were done in you, long ago they would (have) repented in
  sackcloth and ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But I say to
  you, that they shall spare Tyre and Sidon in (the) day of the judgement
  rather than you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And thou,
  Kapharnaum, wilt thou be exalted up to (the) heaven? thou shalt be humiliated
  down to Amenti: because if in Sodom (had) been done these mighty works which
  were done in thee, how would they not (have) remained until to-day!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But I say to you, that they shall
  spare (the) land of Sodom in (the) day of the judgement rather than thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And at that time Jesus answered and
  said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of (the) heaven and the earth, because thou
  hiddest these (things) from (the) wise and understanding, and revealedst them
  to little children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Yea, Father,
  because this is the good pleasure which was before thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> All things hath (the) Father given me: and no one
  knoweth (the) Son except (the) Father, nor doth any one know (the) Father
  except (the) Son, and he to whom (the) Son willeth to reveal (him).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Come to me, all who toil and are
  laden under their burdens, and I will give you rest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; because I
  (am) meek and I am humble in my heart: and ye shall find a resting-place for
  your souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For my yoke (is) sweet,
  and my burden (is) light.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew12">12</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And at that time Jesus went on (the) Sabbath
  through the cornfields; and his disciples had hungered, and began to pluck
  the ears of corn to eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But the
  Pharisees having seen, said to him: Lo, thy disciples do that which is not
  lawful to do on (the) Sabbath.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he
  said to them: Did ye not read what David did, having hungered, and they who
  were with him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> how he went into (the)
  house of God, and ate the shewbread, of which it was not right for him to
  eat, nor for them who were with him, but only for the priests? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Or did ye not read in the law, that on the
  Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and no sin attaches to
  them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But I say to you, that lo, (one)
  greater than the temple (is) in this place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> If ye were knowing what this meaneth, pity is what
  I wish for, and not sacrifice, ye would not have judged the sinless.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the lord of (the) Sabbath is (the)
  Son of (the) man.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having gone
  away from there, he came into their synagogue: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and lo, (there was) a man whose hand was (lit.
  is) withered, and they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the
  Sabbath?'that they might accuse him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And he said to them: What man who is among you, having a sheep, and (if) this
  fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not lay hold on it and raise it up?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> How much better then is a man than a
  sheep! So that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand.'
  And he stretched it forth, and it was cured as the other. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The Pharisees having come forth, took counsel
  against him, that they might destroy him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Jesus having known, went away from there; and
  great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He charged them that they should not make him
  known: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that it might be fulfilled
  which he spake by Esaias the prophet, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Behold my servant (lit. child), who was pleasing
  to me; my beloved, in whom my soul was well pleased: I shall put my Spirit
  upon him, he shall declare judgement to the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He shall not strive, nor shall he cry out; nor
  shall any one hear his voice in the streets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> A bruised reed he shall not break, smoking flax
  he shall ot quench, until he send forth the judgement to victory.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Gentiles shall hope in his
  name.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Then they brought to him a
  blind man having (lit. being) a demon with him, and being dumb: and he healed
  him, so that the dumb spake and saw. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  But the multitudes were all amazed; they were saying: Is this (the) son of
  David?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But the Pharisees having
  heard said: This man was not casting out the demons by (lit. in, and thus
  again) any but by Belzeboul (the) ruler of the demons.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And having perceived their thoughts he said to
  them: Every kingdom, if it should be divided against itself, is brought to
  desolation; and every city or every house, if they should be divided against
  themselves, cannot stand: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and. if
  Satan cast out Satan, or was divided against himself, how then will his
  kingdom be able to stand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if I by
  Belzeboul cast out the demons, by whom did your sons cast out? therefore they
  shall be judges to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if by the
  (lit a) Spirit of God I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God reached
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Or how is it possible that one
  enter (the) house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, unless he bound the
  strong man first, and then spoiled his house? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> He who is not with me was against me; and he who
  gathereth not with me scattereth me away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Therefore I say to you, that every sin and every
  blasphemy shall be forgiven to [the] men; but the blasphemy against the Holy
  Spirit shall not be forgiven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he
  who will say a word at (the) Son of (the) man, it shall be forgiven him; but
  he who will speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him,
  neither in this age nor in that which cometh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or
  make the tree evil, and its fruit evil: for from the fruit they know the tree
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> [The] offspring of the vipers, how is
  it possible for you to speak good things, being evil? for out of (the)
  abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> The good man out of his good treasure sendeth
  forth the good (thing): and the man who is evil, out of his treasure which is
  evil, sendeth forth (things) which are evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And I say to you, that all vain words which [the]
  men will say, they will give account about them in (the) day of the
  judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For out of thy words thou
  shalt be justified, and out of thy words thou shah be judged.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Then some of the scribes and the Pharisees
  answered him, saying: Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But he answered, he said to them: The generation
  which is evil and adulterous seeketh for a sign; and a sign shall not be
  given to it except the sign of Jona the prophet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> For as Jona, who was in (the) belly of the whale
  three days and three nights; thus also (the) Son of (the) man shall be three
  days and three nights in (the) heart of (the) earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> The men of Ninevê shall rise up in the judgement
  with this generation, and shall judge it: because they repented at (the)
  preaching of Jona; and lo, greater than Jona (is) here. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> The queen of (the) south shall rise up in the
  judgement with this generation and shall judge it: because she came from
  (the) ends of (the) earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo, greater than
  Solomon (is) here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But if the unclean
  spirit come out of the man, he goeth forth to dry places, seeking for (a)
  resting-place, and findeth not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Then
  he saith: "I shall return into my house, the place from which I came; "and if
  he should come, and find it empty, swept and garnished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Then he goeth, and taketh with himself seven
  other spirits more evil than himself, and he cometh and dwelleth there: and
  the last (states) of that man are worse for him than his first. Thus it will
  be for this generation which is evil.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And while he is speaking with the multitudes, lo,
  his mother and his brothers were standing outside. seeking to speak with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And one of the disciples said to him:
  Behold thy mother and thy brothers outside seek for thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> But he answered, he said to him who told him: Who
  is my mother? or who are my brothers?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And he stretched out his hand upon his disciples,
  he said: Behold my mother and my brothers! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> For every one who will do the will of my Father
  who is in the heavens, he is my brother and my sister and my mother.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew13">13</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> On that day Jesus having come out of the house was
  sitting by (the) sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And great
  multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into (the) ship, and sat; and
  the whole multitude was standing on (the) sea (shore). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he was speaking with them many (things) in
  parables, saying: Lo, the sower came forth to sow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And in (the) sowing some indeed fell by the road,
  and the birds came and ate them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and
  others fell upon the rocky place, the place in which there was not depth of
  earth: and they grew up immediately, because they had not depth of earth:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and (the) sun having risen, they were
  scorched; and because they had not root there, they withered away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And others fell upon the thorns; and
  the thorns grew up, and choked them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  and others fell upon the good earth, and yielded fruit; one indeed produced a
  hundred, and another produced sixty, and another produced thirty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He who hath an ear to hear let him
  hear.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And his disciples having come
  to him, said to him:'Wherefore speakest thou with them in parables?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he answered, he said: To you it
  is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it
  is not given. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For to him who hath
  shall be given, and it shall be exceeding to him: but he who hath not, that
  which he hath shall be taken away from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore I speak with them in parables: because
  seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the prophecy of Esaias shall be
  fulfilled upon them, which saith: By hearing (lit. in a voice) ye shall hear
  and shall not understand; and by (lit. in) seeing ye shall see and shall not
  see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For (the) heart of this people
  thickened, and they were heavy in their ears for (the) hearing, and they shut
  their eyes; lest haply they should see with their eyes, and hear in their
  ears, and understand in their heart, and return, and I should cure them."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But blessed are your eyes, because
  they see; and your ears, because they hear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Verily I say to you, that many prophets and
  righteous (men) desired to see the things which ye see, and they saw them
  not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and they heard them not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Hear ye then the parable of the
  sower. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> When any one (lit. every one
  who) heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, the evil
  (one) cometh and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he
  who was sown by the road. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he who
  was sown upon the rocky place, this is he who heareth the word, and
  immediately receiveth it with joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He
  hath no root in him, but is (only) for a time; and if there should be
  tribulation or persecution because of the word, immediately he is offended.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he who was sown upon the thorns,
  this is he who heareth the word; and (the) care of this age, and the deceit
  of [the] riches, choke the word in him, and he becometh unfruitful.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he who fell upon the good earth,
  this is he who heareth the word, and who understandeth it; and this (one)
  yieldeth fruit; and one indeed produceth a hundred; and one produceth sixty;
  and one produceth thirty.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He set
  before them another parable, saying: The kingdom of the heavens is like a
  man, who sowed good seed in his field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But the men having slept, his enemy came, he
  sowed tares in (the) midst of the wheat, and went (away). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But when the wheat grew up, and yielded fruit,
  then the tares also appeared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the
  servants of the owner-of-the-field came and said: "Our lord, sowedst thou not
  good seed in thy field? whence (lit. where) then found they these tares
  also?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said to them: "A man
  (that is) an enemy did this." And they said to him: "Wishest thou that we go
  and gather them up?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But he said:
  "Nay, lest haply gathering up the tares, ye pluck up also the wheat with
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Rather leave them, let them
  grow up together until (the) time of (the) harvest: and in (the) time of
  (the) harvest I shall say to the reapers: Gather up the tares first, and bind
  them in bundles for (the) burning them in the fire: but gather the wheat into
  my barn.'"' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> He set before them
  another parable, saying: The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of
  mustard seed; which a man took, he sowed it in his field: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> which indeed is small among all seeds; but if it
  should be grown, it is greatest of the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the
  birds of (the) heaven come and lodge upon its branches.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Another parable he spake to them: The kingdom of
  the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took, she hid it in three measures
  of meal, until all the dough was leavened.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> All these things said Jesus to the multitudes in
  parables; and without parable he was not speaking with them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> that it might be fulfilled which he spake by the
  prophet, saying: I am to open my mouth in parables; and speak the things
  which were hidden from (the) foundation of the world.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Then he sent away the multitudes, he came into
  the house: and his disciples came to him, saying: Explain to us the parable
  of the tares of the field.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he
  answered, he said: He who sowed the good seed is (the) Son of (the) man;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> and the field is the world; the good
  seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the
  evil (one); <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and the enemy who sowed
  them is the devil: and the harvest (the) end of this age; and the reapers the
  angels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> As, then, they gather up the
  tares first, and burn them in the fire; thus it will be in (the) end of this
  age. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> (The) Son of (the) man shall
  send his angels, and they shall gather up out of his kingdom all the
  offences, and them who do [the] iniquity; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> and shall cast them to the furnace of fire: the
  place in which will be (the) weeping and (the) gnashing of the teeth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> not listed <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid
  in a field; which a man found, he hid it; and for [the] joy he went, he sold
  what he had, and bought that field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchantman seeking for good
  pearls: <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> having found a pearl of great
  price, he went, he sold what he had, and bought it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net,
  which was cast into (the) sea, and it gathered of every kind: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> which having been filled, they drew to the shore,
  and having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they
  cast away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> This is as it will be in
  (the) end of this age: the angels shall come forth, and shall separate the
  wicked from (the) midst of the good: <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>
  and shall cast them down to the furnace of fire: the place in which will be
  (the) weeping and the gnashing of the teeth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Understood ye all these things?' They said to
  him: Yea, Lord.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> He said to
  them:'Therefore every scribe who is instructed for the kingdom of the heavens
  is like an owner-of-a-field, who bringeth forth from his treasure things new
  and old.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And it came to pass (that)
  Jesus having quite finished these parables, went away from there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And having come into his city, he was
  teaching them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: 'Whence
  found this (man) this teaching, and these mighty works? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> Is this (the) son of the carpenter? Is not his
  mother Mary? and his brothers James, and Josê, and Simon, and Judas?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And his sisters, are not they all
  with us? Whence then found this (man) all these things? ' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to
  them: There is not a prophet despised in any place except in his city and his
  house.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And he did not many mighty
  works there because of their unbelief.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew14">14</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And at that time Herod the tetrarch heard of (the)
  fame of Jesus <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and said to his servants
  (lit. children): This is John the Baptist; for he rose from the dead; and
  therefore the powers work in him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, he put him in the prison because
  of Herodias, (the) wife of Philip his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For John was saying to him: It is not lawful for
  thee to take her.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And wishing to kill
  him, he feared the multitude, because he was to them as a prophet.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Herod's birthday having come, the
  daughter of Herodias danced in (the) midst, and was pleasing to Herod.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thereupon he took an oath, promising
  to give her what she will ask. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  she,--her mother instructed her,--said: Give to me (the) head of John the
  Baptist in a dish.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And (the) heart of
  (the) king was grieved, but because of the oaths, and them who sat at meat
  with him, he commanded to give it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And he sent, he took off (the) head of John in the prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it was brought in the dish, it was given to
  the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And his disciples came, they took up the corpse,
  they buried it; and they went, they told Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Jesus having heard, went from there in a ship
  to a desert place: and the multitudes having heard, followed him, they walked
  on foot from the cities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And having
  come forth, he saw a great multitude, and he had compassion upon them; and he
  healed them who were sick among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And evening having come, his disciples came to him, saying: The place is
  desert, and the hour passed away; send the multitudes then away, that they
  may go to the villages, and buy victuals for themselves.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he said: They have not need to go: give ye to
  them; let them eat.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they said to
  him: We have not here but five loaves, and two fishes.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to them: Bring them to me hither.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he commanded the multitudes to
  sit down to meat upon the grass; and having taken the five loaves and the two
  fishes, he looked up to (the) heaven, he blessed them, and brake them, and
  gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they all ate, and were satisfied;
  and they took up that which remained over of the fragments, they filled
  twelve baskets full. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they who ate
  were five thousand men, without children and women. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And immediately he constrained his disciples to
  enter into (the) ship, and to go (lit. draw) before him across, until he sent
  away the multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And having sent
  away the multitudes, he went up on a mountain apart alone to pray: and
  evening having come, he was there alone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But the ship was at a distance from the land
  about twenty-five stadia, the waves being against it, for the wind was
  against it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And in the fourth watch
  of the night he came to them, walking upon (the) sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And having seen him walking upon (the) sea, they
  were troubled, saying: It is an apparition.' And they cried out for [the]
  fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But immediately he spoke with
  them, saying: of good cheer (lit. find courage); it is I; fear not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Peter answered, he said to him:
  Lord, if it is thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he said: Come.' And Peter having
  come down from the ship, walked upon the waters, to come to Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But he saw the wind, he feared, and
  having begun to sink, he cried out, saying: `Lord, save me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And immediately Jesus having stretched out his
  hand, took hold of him, and said to him: (Thou) of [the] little faith,
  wherefore doubtedst thou. (lit. makest two hearts)?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he having entered into the ship, the wind
  ceased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they who were in the ship
  worshipped him, saying: Truly thou art (the) Sou of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And having crossed over, they came into (the)
  land of Gennesareth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the men of
  that place having known him, sent forth in all that region round about; and
  they brought to him all who were afflicted; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> and they were beseeching him that they might only
  touch (the) hem of his garments: and all who touched were saved.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew15">15</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and
  scribes, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Wherefore do thy
  disciples transgress the traditions of the elders? for they wash not their
  hands, being about to eat bread.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  he said to them: Wherefore do ye also transgress the commandment of God
  because of your tradition? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For God
  said: "Honour thy father and thy mother: and he who will say an evil word at
  his father and his mother, he shall die (the) death." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But ye say that he who will say to his father or
  his mother: "A gift, thou wilt gain it by me;" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> he shall not honour his father and his mother. And
  ye made void the word of God because of your traditions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> [The] hypocrites, well prophesied about you Esaias
  the prophet, saying:" <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> This people
  honoureth me with their lips, but their heart (is) far away from me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They shall worship me in vain,
  teaching for doctrines orders of men."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And having called the multitude, he said to them:
  Hear, and understand: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> that which
  goeth into the mouth of the man (is) not that which defileth him; but that
  which cometh from the mouth, this is that which defileth the man.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then came to him his disciples, they
  said to him: Knowest thou that the Pharisees having heard this word were
  offended?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But he answered, he said:
  All trees which my Father, who is in the heavens, planted not, will be cut
  off with their root. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Leave them: they
  are blind guides: for a blind man guiding a blind man, they both Fall into a
  pit.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Peter answered, he said to
  him Exlpain the parable to us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  he said: (Are) ye also even yet without understanding? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Know ye not yet, that all things which go into
  the mouth of the man, go to the belly, and are cast to the draught?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But the things which come out of the
  mouth, came out of the heart; these are (they) which defile the man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For out of the heart come the evil
  reasonings, the murders, the adulteries, the fornications, the thefts, the
  false witnessings, the blasphemies: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  these are they which defile the man; but the eating without washing thyself
  defileth not the man.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jesus
  having come from there, went to the parts of Tyre and Sidon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And lo, a Canaanitish woman came out of those
  boundaries, she was crying out, saying: Pity me, my Lord, (the) son of David;
  my daughter (is) afflicted, there is a demon with her.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples
  came, they besought him, saying: Send this woman away; because she crieth out
  behind us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But he answered, he said:
  I was not sent to any except the stray sheep of (the) house of Israel.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But she worshipped him, saying My
  Lord, help me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he answered, he
  said: It is not good to take away (the) bread of the sons, to give it to the
  dogs.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But she said: Yea, my Lord:
  for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their
  masters.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Then Jesus answered, he
  said to her: O [the] woman, great is thy faith: it shall be to thee as thou
  wishest.' And her daughter was cured from that hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Jesus having gone away from there, came by
  (the) sea of Galilee; and he went upon a mountain, he was sitting there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And great multitudes came to him,
  having (lit. being) with them lame and blind and deaf and maimed and many
  others; they threw them down at his feet, and he healed them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> so that the multitudes wondered, seeing the dumb
  speaking, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and the deaf hearing;
  and they were glorifying (the) God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Jesus having called to his disciples, said to
  them: I have compassion upon this multitude, because lo, three days they are
  here with me, and there is not that which they will eat; and I wish not to
  send them away without eating; that they shall not faint on the road.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The disciples said: Whence are we to
  find this number of loaves on this desert place, so as to satisfy this
  multitude? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus said to them:
  How many loaves have ye? And they said: Seven, and a, few fishes.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he ordered the multitudes to sit
  down to meat upon the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> He took
  the seven loaves and the fishes, and having blessed them, he brake them, and
  gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And they all ate, they were
  satisfied: and they took up that which remained over of the fragments, they
  filled seven baskets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And they who
  were eating were four thousand men, without children and women. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having sent away the multitude, he entered
  into the ship, and came to the boundaries of Magdalan.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew16">16</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Pharisees and the Sadducees came, tempting
  him, they were asking him to show them a sign from (the) heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But he answered, he said to them: 'If evening
  should come ye say, that (the) heaven (will be) calm, being red. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And in the morning ye say, that to-day (will be
  the) storm, because of the redness of (the) heaven and its gloom. [The]
  hypocrites, ye know how to discern (the) heaven; and (the) peace of this time
  ye know not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he answered, he said
  to them: The generation which is evil and adulterous seeketh for a sign; and
  a sign shall not be given it, except the sign of Jona the prophet.' And
  having left them, he went (away). <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  his disciples having come across, forgot to take bread for them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Jesus said to them: Take heed and beware of
  (the) leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they were reasoning in themselves, saying: We
  took not bread with us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Jesus
  having known (it), said to them: Wherefore reason ye among yourselves, ye of
  the little faith, because ye have not bread? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Know ye not yet, nor remember ye the five loaves
  of the five thousand, (and) that ye took how many baskets? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, (and)
  that ye took how many baskets? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> How
  understand ye not that I was speaking to you not concerning (the) bread? but
  beware of (the) leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then they understood that he said not to them:
  Beware of (the) leaven of the loaves; but of the doctrine of the Pharisees
  and the Sadducees.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now Jesus having
  come to the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he was asking his disciples: Who,
  said [the] men, is (the) Son of (the) man?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they said: Some indeed, "John the Baptist:"
  and others, "Elias:" and others, "Jeremias or one from the prophets."'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He said to them: But whom (are) ye
  saying that I (am)?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Simon Peter
  answered, he said: Thou (art) Christ, (the) Son of (the) living God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Jesus answered, he said to him:
  Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood revealed not this to
  thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I say to thee, that thou art Peter, I shall build
  my church upon this rock: and the gates of Amenti shall not have power
  against it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I shall give thee the
  keys of the kingdom of the heavens: that which thou wilt bind upon the earth
  shall be bound in the heavens: and that which thou wilt loose upon the earth
  shall be loosed in the heavens.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Then
  he ordered his disciples that they should not say to any one that he is Jesus
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> From that time Jesus Christ
  began to shew to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many
  things by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed,
  and after three days rise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Peter
  laid hold on him, he began to rebuke him, saying: (God) have mercy on thee,
  my Lord: this shall not be to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  But he said to Peter: Go behind me, Satan: because thou art an offence to me:
  because thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of [the] men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Then said Jesus to his disciples: He
  who wisheth to walk after me, let him deny himself, and let him take up his
  cross, and walk after me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For he who
  wisheth to save his life (lit. soul, thus again) shall destroy it: and he who
  will destroy his life because of me shall find it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For what will [the] man gain, if he should gain
  the whole world, and forfeit his soul? otherwise, what will [the] man give in
  exchange for his soul? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For (the) Son
  of (the) man (is) coming in (the) glory of his Father and his angels: then he
  will give to each one according to his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Verily I say to you, that there are some among
  them who stand here, (who) will not taste of (the) death, until they see
  (the) Son of (the) man coming in (the) glory of his Father.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew17">17</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after six days Jesus, having taken away Peter,
  and James, and John his brother, led them upon a high mountain apart alone:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and he changed himself in form before
  them: and his face gave light as (the) sun, and his clothes were white as the
  light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And lo, Moses and Elias
  manifested themselves to them, speaking to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Peter answered, he said to Jesus: 'My Lord, it is
  good for us that we are here: wishest thou that we make three tabernacles
  here? one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> When he (is) speaking, lo, a cloud of light
  shadowed over them: and lo, there was a voice out of the cloud, saying: This
  is my son, my beloved, he, in whom my soul was well pleased; hearken to him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the disciples having heard (it),
  fell upon their face, and feared greatly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jesus came to them, he touched them, he said:
  Rise, fear not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And having lifted up
  their eyes they saw not any one except Jesus alone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And (as they are) coining down from upon the
  mountain, Jesus ordered them, saying: Tell not any one the vision, until
  (the) Son of (the) man rise from the dead.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the disciples asked him, saying: Wherefore
  say the scribes that Elias cometh first?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he answered, he said: `Elias indeed (is)
  coming, and will shew you everything: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  but I say to you, that Elias already came, and they knew him not, but did to
  him everything which they willed. Thus also (the) Son of (the) man will
  receive pain from them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then his
  disciples understood that he spake to them concerning John the Baptist.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they having come to the
  multitude, a man came to him, throwing himself upon his knees, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and saying: Pity my son: because he is epileptic
  and is afflicted greatly: for many times he falleth into the fire, and many
  times he falleth into (the) water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Then Jesus answered he said to him: O
  [the] faithless generation and which is perverse, how long will I be with
  you? how long will I have patience with you? bring him to me hither.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon
  came out of him: and the child was cured from that hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then the disciples came to Jesus apart alone, and
  said to him: Wherefore could we not cast him out?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said to them: Because of your little
  faith: verily I say to you, that if ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed,
  ye shall say to this mountain, "Go away from here thither," and it shall go
  away; and nothing shall be impossible for you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they
  having returned up to Galilee, Jesus said to them: (The) Son of (the) man
  will be given into (the) hands of [the] men; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and they will kill him, and after three days he
  shall rise.' And their heart was greatly grieved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having come up to Kapharnaum, they who
  received tribute came to Peter, and said to him: Doth not your master pay
  tribute?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He said: Yea.' And having
  come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What thinkest thou, Simon?
  the kings of (the) earth--from whom (are) they taking toll or tax? from the
  sons, or from the strangers?' And he said: From the strangers.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he having said: From the strangers,' Jesus
  answered him: The sons then are free. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  That ye may not offend them, go to (the) sea, cast thy hook, and the first
  fish which will come up, take it; and if thou should open the mouth, thou
  shalt find a stater: take it, give it to them for me and thee.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew18">18</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And in that hour the disciples came to Jesus,
  saying: Who then is the great in the kingdom of the heavens?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he called a little child, and made him stand
  in their midst, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and said: Verily I say
  to you, that unless ye turn yourselves, and become as this child, ye shall
  not come into the kingdom of the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He then who will humiliate himself as this child,
  this is the great in the kingdom of the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he who will to him such a child in my name
  receiveth me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but he who will offend
  one of these little ones who believe me, it is profitable for him that a
  millstone be hanged to him, and that he be drowned in (the) sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Woe to the world because of the offences! for it
  is necessary that the offences come; but woe to the man by whom the offence
  cometh! <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If thy hand or thy foot offend
  thee, cut them off, cast them from thee: it is good for thee that thou come
  into the life being lame or being maimed, than having two hands or two feet
  that thou be cast into the eternal fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out,
  cast it from thee: for it is good for thee that thou come into the life
  having (one) eye, than having two eyes that thou be cast into the Gehenna of
  [the] fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Take heed then! despise
  not one of these little (ones); for I say to you, that their angels in the
  heavens always see (the) face of my Father who is in the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And what think ye? if a man should have a hundred
  sheep, and one of them go astray, leaveth he not the ninety-nine upon the
  mountain, and goeth, and seeketh for that which went astray? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if it should happen that he find it, verily I
  say to you, that he rejoiceth over it more than the ninety-nine which go not
  astray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus it is not (the) wish of
  my Father, who is in the heavens, that one of these little (ones) perish.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if thy brother should sin against
  thee, go and convict him between thee and him alone: if he should willhearken
  to thee, thou shalt gain thy brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  But if he should not hearken to thee, take another or two also with thee,
  that out of the mouth of two or three witnesses all words may be established.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if he should not hearken to them,
  tell it to the church: and if he should not hearken to the church, he shall
  be to thee as a Gentile and a publican. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Verily I say to you, that the things which ye
  will bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens: and the things which
  ye will loose upon the earth shall be loosed in the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Again I say to you, that if two among you should
  agree upon the earth concerning all things which they ask for, it shall be
  done for them of my Father who is in the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the place in which two or three are gathered
  together in my name, I am there in their midst.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Then Peter came to him, he said to him: My Lord,
  if my brother should sin against me, and I forgive him, until how many times?
  until seven times?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Jesus said to
  him: say to thee not until seven times, but seven seventy times. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Therefore the kingdom of the heavens is like a
  man, a king who wished to reckon with his servants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having begun to reckon, one was brought to
  him, who owed many talents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But he
  hath not (wherewith) to give them; and his lord commanded to sell him, and
  his wife, and his sons, and everything which he had, and to pay them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Having thrown himself down then, that
  servant was worshipping him, saying: "My lord, (have) patience with me, and I
  will pay them to thee all." <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the
  lord of that servant having compassion released him, and forgave him all his
  debt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But that servant having come
  forth, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred staters: and
  having laid hold on him, he took him by the throat, saying: "Give (me) thy
  debt." <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Having thrown him-elf down
  then, his fellow-servant was beseeching him, saying: "(Have) patience with
  me, and I will pay them to thee all." <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And he wished not: but he went, he threw him to the prison, until he gave his
  debt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> So his fellow-servants having
  seen the things which were done, their heart was greatly grieved, and having
  come, they told their lord all things which were done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Then his lord called him, he said to him: "[The]
  wicked servant, I forgave thee all thy debt, because thou besoughtest me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Was it not right that thou shouldest
  have pity upon thy fellow-servant, as they had pity for thee?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And having been angry, his lord gave him to the
  tormentors, until he should pay all his debt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Thus will my Father which is in the heavens do to
  you, unless each of you forgive his brother with his whole heart.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew19">19</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass (that) Jesus having finished
  these sayings, went away from Galilee, he came to the boundaries of Judea
  beyond the Jordan; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and great
  multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Pharisees came to him, tempting him, saying:
  'Is it lawful for the man to put away his wife for every sin?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he said: Did ye not read, from (the) beginning
  male and female he created them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  he said: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall join
  himself to his wife: and they two shall become one flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> So that they are no longer two, but it is one
  flesh. That then which God joined, let not (the) man separate.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They said to him: Wherefore then did Moses order
  to give (a) writing of divorcement, and to put them away?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He said to them: Because of your hardness of heart
  did Moses command you to put away your wives: but from (the) beginning it was
  not thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I say to you, that he
  who will put away his wife, without word of fornication, causeth her to
  commit adultery; and he who will marry her who is put away committeth
  adultery.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> His disciples said to him:
  If thus is (the) case of the man with the wife, it is profitable not to
  marry.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But he said to them It is not
  every one (who) receiveth this word, but only they to whom it is given.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For there are eunuchs, who were born
  from their mother's womb: there are other eunuchs, whom [the] men made
  eunuchs: and there are other eunuchs, who made themselves eunuchs because of
  the kingdom of the heavens. He for whom it is possible to receive (it) to
  him, let him receive (it).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then they
  brought to him children, that he should lay hand upon them, and pray over
  (lit. upon) them: and the disciples rebuked them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Jesus said to them: Permit the children,
  forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And having laid hand upon them, he
  went from there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And lo, one came to
  him, he said to him: (The) teacher, what good (thing) wilt I do, that I may
  inherit eternal life? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said to
  him: ':Wherefore askest thou me concerning the good? one is the good, God:
  but if thou wishest to come into the life, keep the commandments.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He said to him: What are (they)?'And
  Jesus said to him: Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou
  shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Honour thy father and thy mother: and thou shalt
  love thy neighbour as thyself.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The
  young man said to him: All these I kept from my youth, what further lack I?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Jesus answered him: If thou wishest
  to be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, give them to the poor, and thou
  shalt get for thee a treasure in (the) heaven: and come, follow me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But the young man having heard the
  word went (away with) his heart grieving: for he had many possessions.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus said to his disciples:
  Verily I say to you, that it is difficult that a rich man come into the
  kingdom of the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Again I say
  to you, that it is easier that a camel enter in (the) eye of a needle, than
  that a rich man enter into the kingdom of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the disciples having heard, wondered greatly,
  saying: For whom then is it possible to be saved?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Jesus having looked (upon them), said to
  them: 'For men impossible is this; but for God everything is possible.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then Peter answered, he said to him:
  we left everything and we followed thee: what then will be to us?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Jesus said to them: Verily I say
  to you, that ye of those who walked after me, in the re-creation if (the) Son
  of (the) man should sit on (the) throne of his glory, they shall seat you
  also on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And every one who left brother, or sister, or
  father, or mother, or wife, or son, or land, or house, because of my name,
  shall receive a hundredfold, and he shall inherit the eternal life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For there are many first about to be
  last; and last about to be first.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew20">20</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The kingdom of the heavens is like a man,--owner
  of land,--who came out in the morning to hire labourers to his vineyard.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he settled with the labourers to
  give to them on the day a stater for each, and he sent them to his vineyard.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And having come out at (the) third
  hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he said to these others: "Go ye also to (the)
  vineyard, and that which is right I will give to you." And they went.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Again he came out at (the) sixth hour
  and (the) ninth hour, he did again thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And having come out at (the) eleventh hour, he
  found others standing; and he said to them: "Why stand ye here all the day
  idle?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They said to him: "Because no
  one hired us for (the) hire." He said to them: Go ye also to (the) vineyard."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And evening having come, the lord of
  (the) vineyard said to his steward: "Call the labourers, give their hire to
  them, having begun from the last unto the first <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they of the eleventh hour having come,
  received a stater for each. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the
  first having come, were thinking that they will receive more; and they also
  received a stater for each. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  having received, they murmured at the owner of land, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> saying. "These last did (but) an hour of work,
  and thou madest them equal with us (being) of them, who bore (the) burden of
  the day, and the scorching heat." <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  he answered, he said to one of them: "My friend, I treat thee not with
  violence: was it not a stater which I settled with thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Take that which is thine (and) go: and I wish to
  give to this last, as to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Is it
  not lawful for me to do what I will with (lit. in) the things which are mine?
  Is thine eye evil because I am good?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Thus the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Jesus, being about to go up to Jerusalem, took to
  him the twelve by (lit. between him and them) themselves, and said to them on
  the road: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Lo, we will go up to
  Jerusalem; and (the) Son of (the) man will be delivered into (the) hands of
  the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn him to (the) death,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and they will deliver him to the
  Gentiles to mock him, and they will scourge him and crucify him: and after
  three days he shall rise.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Then came
  to him (the) mother of the (sons) of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping him,
  and asking him for a thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he
  said to her: What wishest thou?' She said to him: Command, that my two sons
  may sit, one of them on thy right hand, one of them on thy left hand, in thy
  kingdom.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Jesus answered, he
  said: Ye know not concerning what ye asked. Is it possible for you to drink
  the cup which I will drink?'They said to him It is possible for us.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus said to them: The cup
  indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand or my left hand is not
  mine to give, but it belongs to them for whom my Father, who is in the
  heavens, prepared it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the ten
  other disciples having heard, murmured because of the two brothers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Jesus called, he said to them: Ye
  know that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords of them, and their great
  (ones) also are in authority over them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thus it will not be among you; but he who
  wishes to be great among you shall be minister to you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and he who wishes to be first among you shall be
  servant to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> as also (the) Son of
  (the) man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life
  a redemption for many.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And (as he
  is) coming out of Jericho, a great multitude walked after him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And lo, two blind men sat by the road; having
  heard that Jesus will pass by, they cried out, saying: Our Lord, pity us,
  Jesus, (the) son of David.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the
  multitude was rebuking them, that they should hold their peace: but they
  cried out more, saying: Our Lord, pity us, (the) son of David.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Jesus having stood, called them, and said to
  them:'What will ye wish that I should do to you?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> They said to him: Our Lord, that our eyes may
  open.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus having compassion,
  touched their eyes: immediately they saw, and followed him.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew21">21</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when they approached Jerusalem, they came to
  Bethphage, at the mountain of the Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> saying to them: Go to this village
  which is in front of you, and ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
  loose them, bring them to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And if
  any one should speak to you, say, that the Lord has need of them; and he will
  send them immediately.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Now this was
  done, that it might be fulfilled which he spoke by the prophet, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Say to (the) daughter of Sion, that
  lo, thy King cometh, being meek, mounted on an ass, and a colt (the) foal of
  an ass.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And his disciples having
  gone, and having done according as Jesus commanded them, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> brought the ass, and the colt, and placed on them
  their garments; and made him sit above them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the most part of the multitudes spread their
  garments on the road; others cut branches from the trees, they spread them on
  the road. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the multitudes walked
  before him, and they who were walking after him, were crying out, saying:
  Osanna, (the) son of David, blessed is he who cometh in (the) name of the
  Lord; Osanna in the highest.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  having come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying: Who is this?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the multitudes said, that this is
  the prophet. Jesus, the Nazarene of Galilee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Jesus went into the temple, and cast out all
  who sold in the temple and them who bought, and the tables of the
  money-changers he overthrew, and the seats of them who sold doves,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and he said to them: It is written,
  that my house shall be called "a house of prayer;" but ye make it a den of
  robbers.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And blind and lame having
  come to him in the temple, he healed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the chief priests and the scribes having seen
  the wonders which he did, and the children who cried out in the temple,
  saying: Osanna, (the) son of David,' murmured, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and said to him: Hearest thou not what these
  say?' And Jesus said to them: Yea: did ye never read in the Scriptures, that
  out of the mouths of little children and sucklings thou preparedst the
  praise?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having left them, he
  came outside of the city to Bethany; he slept there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Now morning having come, he returned to the city,
  he hungered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having seen a
  fig-tree on the road, and having come to it, he found not anything upon it
  except leaves only: and he said to it: Fruit shall not come from thee for
  ever.' And the fig-tree withered away from that hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the disciples having seen, wondered, saying:
  How this fig-tree withered away in this hour !' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to them: Verily I say
  to you, that if ye have faith, and doubt not, not only will ye do this which
  is done to this fig-tree, but if ye should say to this mountain, "Lift
  thyself up, and go into the sea," it shall be done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And everything which ye will ask in prayer,
  believing, ye shall receive.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  having come to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people
  came to him teaching, saying: With what authority didst thou these things?
  and who gave to thee this authority? ' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Jesus answered, he said to them: I will also ask
  of you a word: if ye should tell me it, I also will tell you with what
  authority I did these things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The
  baptism of John, whence was it from? from (the) heaven or from [the] men is
  it?'And they reasoned in themselves, saying: If we should say, that it is
  from (the) heaven, he will say to us: "Wherefore did ye not believe him?"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But if we should say, that (it is)
  from [the] men; we fear the multitude; for John is to them as a prophet.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they answered, they said to
  Jesus: We know not.' And he said to them: Neither will I also tell you with
  what authority I did these things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  But what think ye? There was a man who had two sons: he came to the first, he
  said to him: "My son, go to-day, work in the vineyard." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he answered, he said: "I (go), my lord." And
  he went not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> He came to the second,
  he said to him again thus. And he answered, he said: "I wish not:" but at
  last having repented, he went. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Which
  of the two did the will of his father?'They said: The last.' Jesus said to
  them: Verily I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots will go before
  you into the kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For John
  came to you in the road of [the] righteousness, and ye believed him not: but
  the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye saw, and ye did not repent
  at last for (the) believing him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Hear
  another parable. There was a man, an owner of land, who planted a vineyard,
  and set a hedge round it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower in
  it, and delivered it to husbandmen, and went into (the) foreign (land).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And when (the) time of the fruits
  approached, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the husbandmen took his servants,
  one indeed they beat, and another they killed, and another they stoned.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Again, he sent other servants 'more
  in number than the first: and they did to them again thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But at last he sent his son to them, saying:
  "They will reverence my son." <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But the
  husbandmen having seen the son, said in themselves: "This is the heir; come,
  let is kill him, and take his inheritance." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And they took him, they cast him outside of the
  vineyard, and killed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> If the lord
  of the vineyard should come, what will he do to those husbandmen?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> They said to him: He shall miserably
  destroy the miserable men, and he shall deliver the vineyard to other
  husbandmen, who will give his fruits to him in their time.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And Jesus said to them: Did ye never read in the
  Scriptures, that the stone which the builders rejected, this was made for
  completion of (the) corner: this having been done by the Lord, and it is
  wonderful in our eyes? <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Therefore I
  say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall
  be given to another nation, which will produce its fruits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And he who will fall upon this stone, it shall
  break him to pieces; and he indeed upon whom it will fall, it shall scatter
  him as dust.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And the chief priests
  and the Pharisees having heard his parables, knew that he spoke (lit. said
  it) concerning them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And they were
  seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the multitude, because he was to them
  as a prophet.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew22">22</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jesus answered them in parables, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The kingdom of the heavens is like a
  man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and sent his servants to call for them who were
  invited into the marriage feast: and they wished not to come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Again he sent servants. saying: "Say to them who
  were invited, that, lo, I prepared my dinner: my calves and the fatlings are
  killed. all (things) are prepared: come into the marriage feast.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But they having made light (of it),
  went, one indeed to his land; and another to his merchandise: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and (the) rest laid hold on his servants, they
  reviled them, and killed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But the
  king was angry; and sent his army, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt
  their city with [the] fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then he
  said to his servants: "The marriage feast indeed is prepared, but they who
  were invited were not worthy: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but go
  forth to the crossings (lit. places of walking) of the roads, and them whom
  ye will find invite into the marriage feast." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And those servants having come forth on the
  roads, gathered all whom they found, them who were bad and them who were
  good: and the marriage feast was filled with the guests. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the king having come in to see the guests,
  saw a man there not clothed with (the) raiment of the marriage feast:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and he said to him: "My friend, how
  camest thou in hither, not clothed with (the) raiment of the marriage feast?"
  And he was speechless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then the king
  said to the ministers: "Bind this (one), hand and foot, cast him to the outer
  darkness; the place in which will be (the) weeping and (the) gnashing of the
  teeth." <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For there are many invited;
  few are the chosen.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Then the
  Pharisees went, they took counsel against him, that they might ensnare him by
  word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they sent their disciples
  to him with the Herodians, saying: (The) teacher, we know that thou (art)
  true, and the road of God thou (art) teaching in truth, and carest not for
  any one: for thou regardest not (the) person of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Say then to us, what thinkest thou? is it lawful
  to give tax to (the) king or not?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  But Jesus having known their wickedness, said: Wherefore tempt ye me, [the]
  hypocrites? <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Shew me (the) coin of the
  tax.' And they brought to him a stater. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jesus said to them: Whose is this image and
  these writings?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They said to him:
  (The) king's are they.' Then he said to them: Give (the) king's (things) to
  (the) king, and give God's (things) to God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And having heard they wondered, and they left
  him, they went (away). <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And in that
  day came to him Sadducees, who say that there is not to be resurrection: and
  they asked him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> saying. (The)
  teacher, Moses said to us, that if one should die, having no son, that his
  brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> There were, then, seven brothers with us: and the
  first, having taken (a wife), died, and he had no seed, he left his wife to
  his brother; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> thus again the second,
  and the third, unto the seventh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And
  at (the) end of them all, died the woman also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In the resurrection, then, of whom is she to be
  wife among the seven? for they all took her.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But Jesus answered, he said to them: Ye err, ye
  know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For in the resurrection they take not, nor are
  taken (to wife), but they are to be as the angels of God in (the) heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But concerning the resurrection of
  the dead, did ye not read that which was said to you by God, saying:"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> I am God of Abraham and God of Isaac
  and God of Jacob?" God is not (the God) of the dead, but of the living.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the multitudes indeed having
  heard, wondered at his teaching. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But
  the Pharisees having heard that he put the Sadducees to silence, gathered
  together. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And one of them being a
  lawyer, asked him, tempting him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  (The) teacher, what is the great commandment which is in. the law?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he said to him: Thou shalt love
  the Lord thy God from all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy thoughts.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> This is the great and first
  commandment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> The second is like to
  this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> On these two commandments the law and the
  prophets were hung.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And the
  Pharisees having gathered together, Jesus asked them:' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> What think ye concerning Christ? of whom is he
  (the) son?'They said to him:'(The) son of David.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Jesus said to them: How then doth David in the
  Spirit call him "my Lord," saying:" <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span>
  The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I put thine
  enemies below thy feet?'" <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> If then
  David call him "my Lord," how is he his son?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And no one could answer him a word, nor did any
  one venture to ask him (a question) from that day.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew23">23</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Jesus spake to the multitudes and his
  disciples, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The scribes and the
  Pharisees sat in the seat of Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  All things which they will say to you, do them, and keep them: but do not
  according to their works; for they say them, and they do them not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yea, they bind heavy burdens and place
  them upon (the) shoulder of [the] men; but they (themselves) wish not to move
  them with their finger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But all their
  works they do that [the] men may see them: for they broaden their
  phylacteries, and they make (the) hems of their garments to be enlarged,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and they love the first places in the
  feasts, and the first places on the seats in the synagogues, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and the salutations in the market-places, that
  [the] men may call them "Rabbi." <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  be not ye called "Rabbi:" for one is your teacher, and ye all are brothers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And call not (any) as father to you
  upon the earth: for one is your father, who is in the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Nor call (any) scribe to you: for one is your
  scribe, Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the great (one)
  who is among you shall be minister to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he who will exalt himself will be humiliated,
  and he who will humiliate himself will be exalted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And woe
  to you [the] scribes and [the] Pharisees, [the] hypocrites! because ye shut
  the kingdom of the heavens before [the] men: for ye come not in (yourselves),
  nor they who come, do you permit them to come in. * So through out
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
  hypocrites! because ye go round (the) sea, and that which is dry, to make a
  proselyte; and if he should be made, ye make him son of Geenna twofold (more)
  than yourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Woe to you, [the]
  blind guides, who say, that he who will swear by the temple, it is nothing;
  but he who will swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> [The] fools and blind: for which is greater, the
  gold, or the temple which halloweth the gold? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he who will swear by the altar, it is
  nothing; but he who will swear by the gift which is upon it, he is a debtor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> [The] fools and blind: for what is
  greater, the gift, or the altar which halloweth the gift? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He, then, who sweareth by the altar, swore by it,
  and everything which is upon it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  he who sweareth by the temple, swore by it, and him who dwelleth in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he who sweareth by (the) heaven,
  swore by the throne of God, and him who sitteth upon it <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
  Because ye give (the) tithe of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and ye
  left (out) the weighty things of the law --[the] judgement and [the] pity and
  [the] faith: these it was right that ye should do, and the others that ye
  should not leave (out). <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> [The] blind
  guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
  Because ye cleanse outside of the cup and the platter, but inside of them
  (is) full of extortion and uncleanness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> [The] blind Pharisee, cleanse inside of the cup
  first, and the platter, that outside of them may be cleansed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites Ye
  are like to sepulchres smeared with lime: outside of them, indeed, they
  appear beautiful, but inside of them (is) full of bones of dead (men) and all
  uncleanness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Thus ye also, outside of
  you, indeed, ye appear before [the] men as righteous, but inside of you (is)
  full of hypocrisy and all iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye build the
  sepulchres of the prophets, and ye garnish the caves of the righteous,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> and ye say, that if we had been in
  the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the
  blood of the prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> So that ye
  bear witness against yourselves, that ye (are the) sons of them who slew the
  prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And ye also, fill (ye) up
  (the) measure of your fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> [The]
  serpents, offspring of [the] vipers! How will ye be able to flee from the
  judgement of the Geenna? <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Therefore
  lo, I will send to you prophets and wise scribes: and ye shall kill (some) of
  them; and ye shall crucify (them), scourging them in your synagogues, and ye
  shall persecute them from city to city: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> that all righteous blood which was shed upon the
  earth may come upon you, from (the) blood of Abel the righteous, unto (the)
  blood of Zacharias (the) son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
  and the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Verily I say to you,
  that all these things shall come upon this generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who killeth the prophets,
  and who stoneth them who were sent to her! Many times I wished to gather thy
  sons as a bird gathereth in his brood under his wings, and ye wished not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Lo, I will leave your house to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> For I say to you, that ye shall not
  see me from now, until ye say, that blessed is he who cometh in (the) name of
  the Lord.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew24">24</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jesus having come out of the temple was
  walking (away); and his disciples came to him, shewing him the buildings of
  the temple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But he answered, he said
  to them: Ye see all these things: verily I say to you, that a stone shall not
  be left upon a stone here, (which) will not be pulled down.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And (as he is) sitting upon the mountain of the
  Olives, his disciples came to him apart alone, saying:'Say to us, when these
  things shall be? and what is the sign of thy coining, and (the) end of this
  age?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to
  them: Take heed, let it not (be) that one lead you astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For many shall come in my name, saying, that I am
  Christ; and shall lead many astray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And ye hearing of wars and rumours of war, take heed, be not troubled: for it
  is necessary that they happen; but (the) end is not yet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For nation shall rise upon nation, and kingdom
  upon kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes and famines and deaths in
  different places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But all these things
  are (the) beginning of the pangs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then
  shall they deliver you into tribulation, and they shall kill you: and ye
  shall become hated by all the nations because of my name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then shall many be deserted, and they shall
  deliver (up) one another, and they shall hate one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And many false prophets shall rise, and shall
  lead many astray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And because of
  (the) abundance of [the] iniquity (the) love of many shall be weighed down.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But he who will hold on until the end
  (lit. out), this (one) will be saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a
  witness to all the nations; then shall come the end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if ye see the abomination of (the) desert,
  which he said by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place--he who
  readeth, let him understand <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> then they
  who are in Judea, let them flee upon the mountains: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and he who is upon (the) housetop, make him not
  come down to take away the things which are in his house: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and he who is in (the) field, make him not return
  back to take away his garment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But
  woe to them who are with child, and them who give suck in those days!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And pray that your flight may not be
  in (the) winter, nor on (the) sabbath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For there (shall) be great tribulation in that
  time: there was not like it from (the) beginning of the world until now, nor
  shall there be again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And except that
  those days became few no flesh would have been saved: but because of the
  chosen those days shall become few. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  Then if one should say to you that, lo, Christ is here, or he is there,
  believe them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For false Christs
  shall rise, and false prophets, and they shall show (lit. give) great signs
  and wonders: so that, if it were possible, even my chosen might be led
  astray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Behold, I said to you before.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> If, then, they should say to you
  that, lo, he is in (the) desert, go not forth: lo, he is in the chambers,
  believe them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For as the
  lightning which cometh forth in the east, and manifesteth itself in the west,
  this is as (the) coming of (the) Son of (the) man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The place in which the carcase is, the eagles
  assemble thither. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But immediately
  after the tribulation of those days, (the) sun shall be darkened, and the
  moon shall not give his light, and the stars shall fall down from (the)
  heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Then shall appear the sign of (the) Son of (the)
  man in (the) heaven: and then all the tribes of (the) earth shall wail, and
  they shall see (the) Son of (the) man coming upon the clouds of (the) heaven
  with power and great glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he
  shall send his angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather his chosen
  from the four winds, from one end (lit. their ends) of the heavens unto the
  other (lit. their ends). <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> From the
  fig-tree learn the parable: if now her branches are tender, and her leaves
  unloose, ye know that the summer approacheth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> thus ye also, if ye should see all these things,
  know that it approacheth at the doors. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Verily I say to you, that this generation shall
  not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> (The) heaven and the earth will pass away, but my
  words shall not pass away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Concerning
  that day and the hour no one knoweth, nor the angels of the heavens, except
  (the) Father alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For as the days
  of Noe, thus will it be in (the) coming of (the) Son of (the) man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> For as they were in the days which
  were before the flood: eating and drinking, taking wives and taking husbands,
  until the day in which Noe went into the ark, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and they knew not until the flood came, and took
  away every one: thus will it be in (the) coining of (the) Son of (the) man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Then two being in (the) field; one
  shall be taken away, and one shall be left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Two women grinding in a mill: one shall be taken
  away, and one shall be left. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Watch
  then: because ye know not in what day your Lord shall come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But this know, that if the owner-of-a-house had
  known in what hour the robber is coining to him, he would have watched, that
  he should not permit him to take his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Therefore be ye also prepared, because in the
  hour which ye know not the Son of man is coining. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Who then is the faithful servant and wise, whom
  his Lord will set over his servants, to give to them their food in (the) time
  of giving it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Blessed is that
  servant, if his Lord should come and find him doing thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Verily I say to you, that he will set him over
  all which he hath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> If that wicked
  servant should say in his heart: "My Lord will delay;" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> and he begin to beat his fellow servants, and eat
  and drink with the drunken: <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> the Lord
  of that servant shall come in the day which he expects not, and in the hour
  which he knows not, <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> and he shall cut
  him asunder, and he shall set his portion with the hypocrites, the place in
  which will be (the) weeping and (the) gnashing of the teeth.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew25">25</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then the kingdom of the heavens is like to ten
  virgins, who took their lamps, they came forth to meet the bridegroom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And there were five foolish among
  them, and five wise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the foolish
  having taken their lamps took not away oil with them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but the wise took away oil in their vessels with
  their lamps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Now the bridegroom having
  delayed, they all slumbered and they slept. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But midnight having come, there was a cry: "Lo,
  the bridegroom! Rise, come forth to meet him." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then all those virgins rose and they trimmed their
  lamps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the foolish said to the
  wise: "Give to us of your oil, otherwise our lamps will be quenched."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But the wise answered, saying: (Not
  so), lest haply it should not suffice for us and you: go ye rather to them
  who sell, and buy for yourselves." <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And having gone that they might buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were
  prepared went with him into the marriage feast: and the door was shut.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And at last came (the) rest of the
  virgins, saying:"Our Lord, our Lord, open to us." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But he answered, he said: "Verily I say to you,
  that I know you not." <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Watch then,
  because ye know not the day, nor the hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For as a man being about to go to (the) foreign
  (land), called his servants, and delivered what he had to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> To one indeed he gave five talents, and to one he
  gave two, and to another he gave one; each according to his power; and he
  went to (the) foreign (land). <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he
  who received the five talents went, he worked with them, and got other five.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thus again he who received the two
  got other two. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But he who received
  the one, having gone, dug the (lit. an) earth, and hid (the) silver of his
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Now after a long time came the
  Lord of those servants, and reckoned with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he who received the five talents came, he
  brought other five talents, saying: "my Lord, thou gavest to me five talents:
  lo, I got other five talents." <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  his Lord said to him: "Well, [the] good and faithful servant, since thou wast
  faithful in few things, I shall set thee over great things: go into (the) joy
  of thy Lord." <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he who received the
  two talents came, he said: "my Lord, two talents it is which thou gavest to
  me: lo, I got other two." <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And his
  Lord said to him: "Well, [the] good and faithful servant, since thou wast
  faithful in few things, I shall set thee over great things: go into (the) joy
  of thy Lord." <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he also who
  received the (one) talent came, he said: "my Lord, I knew thee, that thou
  (art) a hard man, reaping that which thou sowedst not, and gathering in that
  which thou scatteredst not: <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and I
  feared, I went, I hid thy talent in the earth: lo, (here is) that which is
  thine from me." <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> His Lord answered, he
  said: "[The] wicked and slothful servant, if thou knowest that I reap that
  which I sowed not, and gather in that which I scattered not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> was it not right then for thee to deliver my
  silver to the bankers, and if I should come I should have received that which
  is mine with its increase? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Take away
  then the talent from this (one), and give it to him of the ten talents.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For to every one who hath shall be
  given, and it shall be exceeding to him: but he who hath not, that which he
  hath shall be taken away from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And cast that unprofitable servant to the outer darkness, the place in which
  will be (the) weeping and (the) gnashing of the teeth." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But if (the) Son of (the) man should come in his
  glory, and all his angels with him, then he shall sit upon (the) throne of
  his glory: <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> and they shall gather
  before him all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as
  the shepherd who separateth the sheep from the goats: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> and the sheep indeed he shall set on his right
  hand, but the goats on his left hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  Then (the) king shall say to them who are on his right hand: "Come to me, ye
  (lit. they) who are blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom which is
  prepared for you from (the) foundation of the world: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> for I hungered, and ye fed me: I thirsted, and ye
  gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye received me to you: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> I was naked, and ye covered me: I was sick, and
  ye visited me: I was in the prison, and ye came unto me." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying "Our
  Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and we fed thee? or thirsty, and we gave thee
  to drink? <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> or when saw we thee a
  stranger, and we received thee to us? or naked, and we covered thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> or when saw we thee sick, or being in
  the prison, and we came unto thee?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span>
  And the king shall answer , he shall say to them: "Verily I say to you, that
  inasmuch as ye did them to one of these least--my brothers, to me ye did
  them." <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Then he shall say to the
  wicked who are on his left hand: "Go from me, [the] cursed, to the eternal
  fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> For I hungered, and ye fed me not: I thirsted,
  and ye gave me not to drink: <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> I was a
  stranger, and ye received me not to you: I was naked, and ye covered me not:
  I was sick, and ye visited me not: I was in the prison, ye came not unto me."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Then they shall also answer, saying:
  "Our Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or
  sick, or being in the prison, and we ministered not to thee?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Then he shall answer them, saying: "Verily I say
  to you, that inasmuch as ye did them not to one of these least, neither to me
  did ye them." <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And these shall go to
  eternal punishment; but the righteous to eternal life.'
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew26">26</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass (that) Jesus having finished
  all these words, said to his disciples: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Ye know that after two more days the Passover will
  be, and (the) Son of (the) man will be delivered to be crucified.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Then the chief priests and the elders
  of the people assembled into the court of the chief priest whom they call
  Caiaphas;' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and they took counsel that
  they might lay hold on Jesus with subtilty, and kill him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They were saying: Let us not do it in (the) feast,
  that there shall not be a tumult among the people.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now Jesus being in Bethany, in (the) house of
  Simon the leper, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> a woman came to him,
  having a vessel of ointment, of great price, and she poured it upon his head,
  sitting at meat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the disciples
  having seen, murmured, saying: What is this waste? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For it was possible to sell this for much, and to
  give them to the poor.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But Jesus
  having known (it), said to them: Wherefore trouble ye the woman? a good work
  she did to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the poor are with
  you always, but I am not with you always. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For this (woman) cast this ointment upon my body
  for my burying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Verily I say to you,
  that where this gospel will be preached in the whole world, that also which
  this woman did shall be spoken of for a memorial to her.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then went one of the twelve, whom they call Judas
  (the) Iscariot,' to the chief priests, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> he said to them: What will ye give me, and I
  myself will deliver him to you? And they settled with him to give him thirty
  (pieces) of silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And from that
  time he was seeking for an opportunity that he might deliver him to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Now on the first day of (the)
  unleavened (bread) his disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where didst thou wish
  (us) to prepare the Passover for thee, to eat it?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to them: Go to this city to such a
  man, and say to him, that the Teacher said: "My time approached; I am to keep
  my Passover at thy house with my disciples."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the disciples did as Jesus said to them; and
  they prepared the Passover. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Now
  evening having come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and (as they are) eating, he said to
  them: Verily I say to you, that one of you will deliver me (up).'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And their heart being greatly
  grieved, they began, each of them, (to say): Is it I, my Lord?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he answered, he said: He who clipped his hand
  with me in the dish, this (one) will deliver me (up). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> (The) Son of (the) man indeed will go, according
  as it is written concerning him: but woe to the man by whom (the) Son of
  (the) man will be delivered (up)! it were good for him (if) that man had not
  been born.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Judas, who was to deliver
  him (up), answered him and said: Is it I, Rabbi?'He said to him: Thou
  saidst.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And (as they are) eating,
  Jesus took bread, and having blessed it, he brake it; and having given it to
  his disciples, he said: Take, eat; for this is my body.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And having taken a cup, and having given thanks,
  he gave it to them, saying: Take, drink of this, all; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> for this is my blood of the new testament, which
  will be shed for many, for (the) forgiveness of their sins to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But I say to you: that I shall not
  drink henceforth of (the) fruit of this vine, until that day when I should
  drink it with you in the kingdom of my Father.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And having blessed, they came out to the mountain
  of the Olives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Then said Jesus to
  them: All ye will be offended in me this night: it is written, that I shall
  smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But after my rising I will go before
  you to Galilee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But Peter answered,
  he said to him: If all will be offended in thee, I, however, shall not be
  offended.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus said to him:
  Verily I say to thee, that in this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt
  deny me three times.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Peter said
  to him: Even if it should come about that I die with thee, I shall not deny
  thee.' And thus were saying all the other disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Then he came with them to a field called
  Gethsemani,' and he said to his disciples: Sit here, until I go yonder and
  pray.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he took away Peter with
  him, and (the) two sons of Zebedee, and he began to be grieved and to be
  dismayed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Then he said to them: My
  soul is grieved unto (the) death: abide here, and watch with me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having gone forward a little, he
  threw himself upon his face, praying, and saying: 'My Father, if it is
  possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
  wilt.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And having come to his
  disciples, he found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: Thus, could ye not
  watch with me for an hour? <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Watch
  then, and pray, that ye come not into temptation: the spirit indeed is ready,
  (but) the flesh is weak.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Again he
  went, he prayed (the) second time, saying: My Father, if it is possible that
  this cup should (not) pass from me except I drink it, let thy will be done.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And he came again to his disciples,
  he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And he left them again, he went, he prayed the
  third time, saying this same word again. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Then he came to his disciples, he said to them:
  Sleep then, and rest yourselves: behold, the hour approached, and (the) Son
  of (the) man will be delivered into (the) hands of [the] sinners.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Rise, let us go; lo, he who will
  deliver me (up) approached.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And he
  having spoken, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came with a great multitude,
  with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Now he who was to deliver him (up)
  gave to them a sign, saying: He whose mouth I will kiss is he, lay hold on
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And immediately he came to
  Jesus, he said to him: Hail, Rabbi;'and he kissed his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And Jesus said to him: `My friend, (do) that
  concerning which thou camest.' Then putting forth their hands upon Jesus they
  laid hold on him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And lo, one of them
  who were with Jesus, stretched out his hand, he drew his sword, and struck at
  (the) servant of the high priest, he cut off his right ear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Then said Jesus therefore to him: Put up again
  the sword into its place: for all who took sword will perish by (the) sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Or thoughtest thou, that it is
  possible for me to pray to my Father, and he would cause more than twelve
  legions of angels to come to me hither, now? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> How then would the Scripture be fulfilled, that
  thus it must be? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> In that hour Jesus
  said to the multitudes: Came ye out as coming after a robber with swords and
  staves to lay hold on me? Was I not sitting daily in the temple to teach, and
  ye laid not hold on me? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> But all
  this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
  all the disciples left him, they fled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And they laid hold on Jesus, they brought him to
  Caiaphas the chief priest, (to) the place whither the scribes and the elders
  of the people were assembling. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> But
  Peter was walking after him afar off, unto the court of the chief priest, and
  having gone in, was sitting with the officers to see the end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Now the chief priests and the whole council were
  seeking for false witness against Jesus, that they might kill him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> and they found not, many false
  witnesses having come. But at last two came, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(61)</span> saying This (man) said that it is possible for me
  to pull down the temple of God, and to build it in three days.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And the chief priest arose, he said to him:
  Answerest thou nothing as to what these bear witness against thee?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> But Jesus was holding his peace. And
  the chief priest said to him: adjure thee by (the) living God, that thou say
  to us, that thou art Christ, (the) Son of (the) living God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Jesus said to him: Thou saidst: nevertheless I
  say to you, that henceforth ye shall see (the) Son of (the) man sitting at
  (the) right hand of [the] power, and coming upon the clouds of (the) heaven.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(65)</span> Then the chief priest rent his
  garments, saying He blasphemed; we have not further need of witness: lo, now
  ye heard the blasphemy: <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> what then
  think ye?' And they answered, they said: 'He is worthy of (the) death.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> Then they spat in his face, and
  struck him, and beat him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> saying:
  'Prophesy to us, Christ, who beat thee?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(69)</span> Now Peter was sitting outside in the court: and a
  maidservant came to him, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> But he was denying before them all,
  saying: 'I know not what thou saidst.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(71)</span> And he having come out to the porch another
  (woman) saw him, and said to them who were there: 'He also was with Jesus of
  Nazareth (lit. the Nazôreos).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(72)</span> Again
  he denied with an oath: 'I know not this man.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(73)</span> And after another little (time) they who stood
  (by) came, they said to Peter: 'Truly thou also (art) one of them; for thy
  speech manifesteth thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(74)</span> Then he
  began to curse and to swear: I know not this man.' And immediately a cock
  crew. <span style="color:#b00e23">(75)</span> And Peter remembered the word
  which Jesus said to him: Before a cock crow thou wilt deny me three times.'
  And having come out he wept a bitter weeping.
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew27">27</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now morning having come, all the chief priests and
  the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so that they might kill
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And having bound him, they took
  him away, they delivered him to Pilate the governor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Then Judas, who delivered him (up), having seen
  that he was condemned, having repented, returned the thirty (pieces) of
  silver to the chief priests and the elders, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> saying: I sinned, because I delivered (up)
  righteous blood.' But they said: What (is that) to us? thou shalt suffice for
  (it).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he cast forth the silver
  (pieces) into the temple, he went, he strangled himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the chief priests, having taken the silver
  (pieces), said: It is not lawful to cast them to the sacred-treasury, because
  it is (the) price of blood.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter, for a
  burial place for the strangers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Therefore they called (the) name of that field: (The) field of the blood'
  until to-day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then was fulfilled that
  which he spake by Jeremias the prophet, saying: They took the thirty (pieces)
  of silver, the price of him whom (the) sons of Israel priced, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and they gave them for (the) field of the potter,
  according as the Lord commanded me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying: Art
  thou (the) king of the Jews? 'And Jesus said: Thou saidst.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And while the chief priests and the elders were
  causing him to be accused, he answered not anything. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then Pilate said to him: Hearest thou not how
  much witness is borne against thee?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And he answered him not with any word; so that the governor wondered greatly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Now at (the) feast it was (the)
  custom of the governor to release one of them who were bound to the
  multitude, him whom they wish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  they had one bound at that time, who was (lit. is) a robber, called
  Barabbas.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They having assembled
  together, Pilate said to them: Whom wish ye that I release to you? Barabbas
  or Jesus who is called "Christ?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For
  he was knowing that they delivered him (up) because of envy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And (as he is) sitting on the judgement seat, his
  wife sent to him, saying: Do nothing to that righteous man, for I suffered
  much because of him this night in (the) dream.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded
  the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The governor then answered, he said
  to them: Whom wish ye that I release to you of these two?'And they said:
  Barabbas.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Pilate said to them: What
  shall (lit. will) I do to Jesus who is called "Christ?" 'They all said: Let
  him be crucified.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The governor said
  to them: Why, what evil did he?' But they were crying out the more, saying:
  Crucify him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> So Pilate having seen
  that he will gain nothing, but rather (that) a tumult will be made, took
  water, washed his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent from
  (the) blood of this righteous (man): ye shall suffice for (it).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And all the people answered, they (lit. he) said:
  `His blood (shall be) upon us, and upon our sons.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then he released Barabbas to them: but having
  scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took away Jesus
  into the Prætorium; they gathered the whole band upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And having stripped him, they clothed him with a
  scarlet robe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they plaited a
  crown of thorns, they placed it upon his head, and they put a reed in his
  right hand; and they threw themselves upon their knees before him, mocking
  him, saying: Hail, (the) king of the Jews!' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And having spit in his face, they took away the
  reed, they struck his head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And
  having finished mocking him, they stripped him of the robe, they clothed him
  with his garments, and took him away to be crucified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And coming out they found a man--a Cyrenian whose
  name was (lit. is) Simon: this (one) they compelled to go (with them) that he
  might take up his cross. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And having
  come to a place which they call Golgotha,' which is the place of the skull,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> they gave wine to him mingled with
  gall: and having tasted he wished not to drink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And having crucified him, they divided his
  garments among them, having cast lot for them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And they were sitting, guarding him there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And they wrote his accusation above
  his head, written thus: 'This is (the) king of the Jews.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Then they crucified two robbers also with him,
  one on his right hand, and one on his left hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And they who passed by were blaspheming him,
  shaking their head, <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> saying: Thou
  (lit. he) who will destroy the temple of God, and build it in three
  days,--save thyself. If thou art (the) Son of God come down from the tree
  (lit. wood).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> This is how (lit. as)
  the chief priests with the scribes and the elders mocked him, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> He saved others; it is not possible
  for him to save himself. If (he) is (the) king of Israel, let him come down
  now from the tree, and let us believe him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> If he trusted in God, let him save him, if he
  wish (for) him: for he said that I am (the) Son of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And this the robbers also were saying, who were
  crucified with him, reproaching him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  From (the) sixth hour there was (the) darkness upon all (the) land until
  (the) ninth hour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And (the) ninth
  hour having come, Jesus cried out with a great cry, saying: Eloi eloi lema
  sabakthani? 'which is this, My God, my God, wherefore didst thou leave me?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And some of them who stood there,
  having heard, were saying: He called to Elias.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And immediately one of them ran, took a sponge,
  filled it with vinegar, and pierced (it) on (lit. to) a reed, they gave him
  to drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And (the) rest were saying:
  Let it (be); and let us see if (lit. that) Elias cometh and saveth him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And Jesus cried out again with a
  great cry, he gave (up) the spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span>
  And lo, the veil of the temple was broken from (the) top to (the) bottom; it
  (was) made two (pieces): and the earth quaked; and the rocks were broken;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> and the sepulchres opened; and many
  bodies of them who slept, of the saints, rose; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> and having come out of the sepulchres after his
  rising, went into the holy city, and manifested themselves to many.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> Now the centurion, and they who were
  with him, guarding Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things which
  were done, feared greatly, saying: Truly this was (the) Son of God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And many women were there, seeing
  afar off, these were they who walked after Jesus from Galilee, ministering to
  him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> these--among whom was Mary the
  Magdalene, and Mary of James, and (the) mother of Joseph, and (the) mother of
  (the) sons of Zebedee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And evening
  having come, a rich man from AriMatthewheas came, whose name was (lit. is)
  Joseph. This (man) also had been a disciple of Jesus: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> this (man) having come to Pilate, asked for the
  body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded to give it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean
  linen cloth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> and laid it in his new
  sepulchre, which he hewed-out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the
  mouth of the sepulchre, he departed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span>
  And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting before the
  sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> Now on the (lit. his)
  morrow, which is (the day) after the Preparation, the chief priests and the
  Pharisees assembled to Pilate, <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span>
  saying: Our lord, we remembered that that deceiver said, while living, that
  after three days I will rise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Command
  then, to make sure the sepulchre until the third day, lest his disciples come
  and take him away by stealth, and say to the people, that he rose from the
  dead: and the last error (will be) worse for us than the first.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And Pilate said to them: Ye have guards: go, make
  it sure as ye know (how to make) it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span>
  So they went, they made sure the sepulchre, they sealed it, the guard (being)
  with (them).
  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._matthew28">28</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now in the night (lit. Now evening) of the
  sabbaths, being morning of (the) first (lit, to (the) one) of the sabbaths,
  Mary the Magdalene came and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And lo, there was a great earthquake; an angel of
  the Lord came down from (the) heaven, and rolled the stone from the mouth of
  the sepulchre, and was sitting upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his form was (imperf.) as lightning, and his
  raiment white as snow: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and for fear of
  him (lit. his fear) they who guard quaked, and were as dead men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the angel answered, he said to the women:
  'Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek for Jesus who was crucified.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He is not here; for he rose, as he
  said. Come see the place in which he was laid. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And quickly go, say to his disciples, that he rose
  from the dead; and lo, he will go before you to Galilee; ye will see him
  there: behold, I told (lit. said) you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they went quickly from the sepulchre in fear
  and great joy, and were running to tell his disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail!' And
  they laid hold on his feet, and worshipped him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then Jesus said to them: Fear not: go, tell my
  brothers, that they go to Galilee, and see me there.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They having gone, lo, some of the guards came to
  the city, they told the chief priests all things which were done.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And having assembled with the elders,
  and taking counsel, they took suitable money, they gave it (lit. them) to the
  soldiers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> (saying:) 'Say that his
  disciples having come by night, took him away by stealth, and while we sleep.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if the governor hear this word,
  we shall persuade him, and shall rid you of care.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So they having taken the silver pieces, did as
  they were taught: and this word spread abroad among the Jews until to-day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The eleven disciples went up to
  Galilee, upon the mountain which Jesus appointed to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having seen him, they worshipped him: but
  some doubted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jesus having come,
  spake to them, saying: All authority was given me in (the) heaven and on the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Go then, teach all nations,
  baptising them into (the) name of (the) Father and (the) Son and the Holy
  Spirit: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> teaching them to keep all
  things which I ordered you: and behold, I am with you all the days unto (the)
  end of the ages.'
