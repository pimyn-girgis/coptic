  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> That which was (ET) from (the)
  beginning, that which we heard, that which we saw with our eyes, that which
  we gazed at, and our hands handled, concerning the word of (the) life:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and the life was manifested, and we
  saw it, and we witness, and we show to you the eternal life, that which was
  with the Father, and it was manifested to us; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> that which we saw and we heard we proclaim to you,
  that ye also--that there may be a fellowship to you with us; but our
  fellowship is with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And these things we write to you, that your joy
  may be complete. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And this is the
  promise which we heard from him; we proclaim it to you, that God is [a]
  light, and there is not any darkness in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> If we should say that we have a fellowship with
  him, and are walking in the darkness, we are saying false, and we do not
  (the) truth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> if we should walk in the
  light, as he also walketh in the light, we have a fellowship with one
  another, and (the) blood of Jesus his Son will cleanse us from all sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If we should say that we have not sin,
  we deceive ourselves, and (the) truth is not in us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If we should confess our sins, he is faithful and
  is righteous that he should forgive us our sins, and he will cleanse us from
  all wrongdoing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> If we should say that
  we sinned not, we make him false, and his word is not in us.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._john2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My children, these things I write
  to you, that ye may not sin. And if one should sin, we have the paraclete
  with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and he is (the) redemption of our sins; but not
  concerning ours only, but also concerning those of the whole world.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And in this we shall (lit. will) know
  that we knew him, if we should keep his commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He who saith: I knew him,' and kept not his
  commandments is false, and (the) truth is not in this (one): <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> he who will keep his word, truly the love of God
  was completed in this (one). In this we shall (lit. will) know that we are in
  him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> he who saith: 'I abide (son) in
  him,' ought as he walked to walk also thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> My beloved, (it is) not a new commandment which I
  write to you, but it is an old commandment, this which ye were having from
  (the) beginning, the old commandment, the word which ye heard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Again, (it is) a new commandment which I write to
  you, this in which there is [a] truth and in you, because the darkness will
  pass away, the true light now shineth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  He who saith: I am in the light,' and he hateth his brother was in the
  darkness until now. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He who loveth his
  brother abode (on) in the light, and there is not occasion of stumbling in
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He who hateth his brother was in
  the darkness, and he walked in the darkness, and he knoweth not whither he
  walked. Because the darkness blinded his eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I write to you, [the] children, because your sins
  will be forgiven you because of his name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I write to you, [the] fathers, because ye know
  him who is from (the) beginning. I write to you, [the] young men, because ye
  conquer the evil (one). <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I wrote to
  you, [the] children, because ye know the Father. I wrote to you, [the]
  fathers, because ye know him who is from (the) beginning. I wrote to you,
  [the] young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth (in you,
  and ye conquered the evil (one). <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Love
  not the world, nor the things which are in the world. But if one should love
  the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because everything which is in the world, the
  lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the arrogancy of this life,
  these are not from the Father, but they are from the world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the world will pass away, and its lust; but
  he who doeth (the) wish of God will abide for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> [The] children, it is (the) last hour: and
  according as ye heard that the antichrist is coming, now, lo, many
  antichrists came; in this we shall (lit. will) know, that it is (the) last
  hour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They came from us, but they are
  not from us; had they been from us, they would have abode with us: but that
  they might be manifested that all are not from us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And ye also have an anointing from the holy
  (one), and ye know all things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I
  wrote not to you, because ye know not (the) truth, but because ye know it,
  that all false (ones) are not from (the) truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Who is the false (one) except him who denieth
  that Jesus is [not] Christ? This is the antichrist, because he who denieth
  (the) Father, denieth also the Son.christ, that denieth the Father and the
  Son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And every one who denieth the
  Son hath not the Father also: he who confesseth the Son hath the Father also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Ye also--let that which ye heard,
  from (the) beginning abide in you. But if that which ye heard from (the)
  beginning should abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son and the Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> This is the promise which he himself
  promised to us, the eternal life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  These things I wrote to you concerning them who lead you astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And ye--the anointing which ye received of him
  abideth in you; and ye need not (me) to write to you; or that one should
  teach you; but as the same spirit teacheth you concerning all things, and is
  true; it is not false: according as it instructed you, abide in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And now also, my children, abide in
  him; that, if he should be manifested, ye will have [a] boldness, and will
  not be ashamed from him in his coming. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> If ye should see that he is righteous, know that
  every one who doeth [the] righteousness was born from him.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._john3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> See how great love the Father gave
  to us, that we should be called The children of God': we are such (lit.
  some). Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew not him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> My beloved, now we (are) children of
  God, and it is not yet manifested of what kind we were to be; but we know
  that, should he be manifested, we shall (lit. will) be like him; because we
  see him according as he is. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Every one
  who hath this hope, purifieth himself in him, according as he is pure.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Every one who doeth (the) sin, doeth
  also [the] lawlessness: for (the) sin is (the) lawlessness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And we know that he was manifested, that he might
  take away the sins; and (the) sin is not in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Every one who abideth in him sinneth not: every
  one who doeth (the) sin saw not him, nor knew him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> [The] children, let not any one lead you astray:
  he who doeth [the] righteousness is righteous, according as he is righteous.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But he who doeth (the) sin is from the
  devil; because the devil sinneth from (the) beginning. Therefore (the) Son of
  God was manifested, that he might pull clown the works of the devil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Every one who was born from God
  sinneth not, because there is a seed of his abiding in him: and it is not
  possible for him to sin, because he was born from God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> In this are manifested the children of God, and
  the children of the devil. Every one who doeth not (the) righteousness is not
  from God, and he who loveth not his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Because this is the promise which ye heard from
  (the) beginning, that ye should love one another: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> not according as Kain, who was from the evil
  (one), and he killed his brother. Why killed he him? Because his works were
  being evil, but those of his brother were righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But wonder not, my brethren, if the world hateth
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> We (pron.) know that we removed
  from (the) death into (the) life because we love the brethren. He who loveth
  not abode in (the) death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Every one
  who hateth his brother is a murderer: and we know that no murderers haves
  eternal life abiding in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> In this
  we knew [the] love, that he laid (down) his life for us: and we also ought to
  lay (down) our lives for one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  But he who hath a life of this world, and seeth his brother having need, and
  shutteth up his tender mercies from him, how will the love of God abide in
  him <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> My children, let us not love in
  (the) word, nor in (the) tongue; but in (the) deed and [the] truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> In this we shall (lit. will) know
  that we (are) from [the] truth, and we shall (lit. will) persuade ourselves
  before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Because if our heart
  should condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and he knoweth all things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> My beloved, if our heart should not
  condemn, us, we have [a] boldness with God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and that which we shall (lit. will) ask, we shall
  (lit. will) receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and we do that
  which is pleasing before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  this is his commandment, that we should believe (the) name of his Son Jesus
  Christ, and love one another, according as he gave commandment to us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he who will keep his commandments
  abideth in him; and he also abideth in him. And in this we shall (lit. will)
  know that he abideth in us through the spirit which he gave to us.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._john4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My beloved, believe not every
  spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God: because many false
  prophets went to the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In this we
  shall (lit. will) know the spirit of God: Every spirit which confesseth that
  Jesus Christ came in (the) flesh is of God: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and every spirit which confesseth not Jesus is not
  of God. And this is the antichrist whom ye heard that he cometh; and now he
  is in the world already. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye are
  children from God, and ye conquered them: because greater is he who is in
  you, than he who is in the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They
  (are) from the world: therefore they speak from the world, and the world
  heareth them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> We are of God: he who
  knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth not us. In this we shall
  (lit. will) know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> My beloved, let us love one another:
  because the love is of God; every one who loveth was born from God, and he
  knoweth God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He who loveth not knew
  not God; because God is [a] love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> In
  this the love of God was manifested in us, because God sent his only Son to
  the world, that we might live through him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The love is in this. Not that we (pron.) loved
  God, but that he (pron.) loved us, and he sent his Son for a redemption of
  our sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> My beloved, if God loved us
  thus, we also ought to love one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> God no one saw ever: if we should love one
  another, God abideth in us, and his love is completed in us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> In this we shall (lit. will) know that we abide
  in him, and he also abideth in us, because he gave to us from his spirit.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And we (pron.) saw and we witness
  that the Father sent his Son for [a] salvation of the world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He who will confess that Jesus is (the) Son of
  God, God abideth in him, and he also abideth in God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And we (pron.) knew and we believed the love of
  God, which is in us. God is [a] love; and he who abideth in [the] love
  abideth in God, and God abideth in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> In this [the] love was completed with us, that we
  might find [a] boldness in the day of the judgement; because according as he
  is thus we also (are) in the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  There is not fear in [the] love: but the completed love casteth [the] fear
  out, because [the] fear hath [a] punishment; but he who feareth is not
  completed in [the] love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> We (pron.)
  love God, because he (pron.) loved us first. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But if one saith: love God,' and is hating his
  brother, he is false: for he who loveth not his brother whom he seeth, God
  whom he saw not, how will he be able to love him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And this commandment we have from him, that he
  who loveth God should love his brother also.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_of_st._john5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Every one who believeth that Jesus
  (is) Christ is born from God: and every one who loveth him who begat loveth
  also him who was begotten from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In
  this we shall (lit. will) know that we love the children of God: If we should
  love God, and do his commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  this is [the] love of God, that we should keep his commandments; and his
  commandments are not burdensome. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Because every one who was born from God conquereth the world: and this is the
  conquest which conquered the world, even our faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But who is he who is conquering the world, except
  him who believeth that Jesus is (the) Son of God? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This is he who came through [a] water and [a]
  blood and [a] spirit, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but also in the
  water and in the blood. And the spirit is (that) which witnesseth, because
  the spirit is the truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Because three
  are they who witness, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> the spirit and
  the water and the blood: and the three are in one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If we receive the witness of [the] men, the
  witness of God is greater: because this is the witness of God, that he
  witnessed of his Son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He who
  believeth (the) Son of God, the witness of God is in him: he who believeth
  not (the) Son of God made him false; because he believed not the witness,
  which God witnessed of his Son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  this is the witness, that God gave to us an eternal life, and this life was
  in his Son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He who hath (the) Son
  hath (the) life; he who hath not (the) Son of God hath not (the) life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> These things I wrote to you, that ye
  might know that ye have an eternal life, ye (lit. they) who believe (the)
  name of the Son of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And this is
  the boldness which we have toward him, that, (of) that which we shall (lit.
  will) ask according to his wish, he heareth us: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and if we should see that he heareth us, of that
  which we shall (lit. will) ask, we know that we have our petitions which we
  shall (lit. will) ask of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> If one
  see his brother sinning a sin which is not unto (the) death, let him ask, and
  [a] life shall be given to him (for) those who sin not of (the sin unto the)
  death. There is sin leading to (the) death: I was not meaning that (sin),
  that he should pray concerning it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  All wrongdoing is (the) sin, and there is sin not leading to (the) death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> We know that every one who was born
  from God sinneth not; but the being born from God keepeth him, and the evil
  (one) toucheth him not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But we know
  that we are from God, and the whole world lay under the evil (one).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But we know that (the) Son of God
  came, and he gave to us a knowledge, that we might know the true God; and we
  are in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and the eternal life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> My children, keep yourselves from the
  idols.</p>
