  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Blessed is the man who has not
  walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of
  sinners, and has not sat in the seat of evil men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But his pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in
  his law will he meditate day and night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of
  waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not
  fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Not so the ungodly; —not so: but rather as the
  chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment,
  nor sinners in the counsel of the just. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but
  the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Wherefore did the heathen rage, and
  the nations imagine vain things? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The
  kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together,
  against the Lord, and against his Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> saying, Let us break through their bonds, and cast
  away their yoke from us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He that
  dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Then shall he speak to them in
  his anger, and trouble them in his fury. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But I have been made king by him on Sion his holy
  mountain, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> declaring the ordinance of
  the Lord: the Lord said to me, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Ask of me, and I will give thee the
  heathen for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thou shalt rule them with a rod of
  iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potter’s vessel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now therefore understand, ye kings: be
  instructed, all ye that judge the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with
  trembling. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Accept correction, lest at
  any time the Lord be angry, and ye should perish from the righteous way:
  whensoever his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that
  trust in him.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">A Psalm of David, when he fled from the
  presence of his son Abessalom.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Many say concerning my soul, There is
  no deliverance for him in his God. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the
  one that lifts up my head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I cried to
  the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I lay down and slept; I awaked; for
  the Lord will help me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I will not be
  afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast
  smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth
  of sinners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Deliverance is the Lord’s,
  and thy blessing is upon thy people.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">For the End, a Song of David among the
  Psalms.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> When I called upon him,
  the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in
  tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> O ye sons on men, how long will ye be slow of
  heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things
  for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon
  your beds for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Many say, Who will shew us
  good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested
  towards us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou hast put gladness
  into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine
  and oil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I will both lie down in peace
  and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her
  that inherits.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hearken to my
  words, O Lord, attend to my cry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O
  Lord, will I pray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> In the morning thou
  shalt hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For thou art not a god that desires
  iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Neither shall the transgressors
  continue in thy sight: thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thou wilt destroy all that speak
  falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I will enter into thine house in the multitude
  of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of
  mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart
  is vain; their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used
  deceit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Judge them, O God; let them
  fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their
  ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee:
  they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all that love
  thy name shall rejoice in thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For
  thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast compassed us as with a
  shield of favour.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">For the End, a Psalm of David among the Hymns
  for the eighth.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord, rebuke
  me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord;
  for my bones are vexed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My soul also
  is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy
  mercy’s sake. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For in death no man
  remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed
  every night; I shall water my couch with tears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am
  worn out because of all my enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice
  of my weeping. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Lord has hearkened
  to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore
  troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord
  because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite.</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord my God, in thee have I trusted: save me
  from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Lest at any time the enemy seize my soul as a
  lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is
  unrighteousness in my hands;) <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> if I
  have requited with evil those who requited me with good; may I then perish
  empty by means of my enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Let the
  enemy persecute my soul, an take it; and let him trample my life on the
  ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath; be exalted in the
  utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the
  decree which thou didst command. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  the congregation of the nations shall compass thee: and for this cause do
  thou return on high. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The Lord shall
  judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and
  according to my innocence that is in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end;
  and then thou shalt direct the righteous, O God that searchest the hearts and
  reins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> My help is righteous, coming
  from God who saves the upright in heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> God is a righteous judge, and strong, and
  patient, not inflicting vengeance every day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If ye will not repent, he will furbish his sword;
  he has bent his bow, and made it ready. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And on it he has fitted the instruments of death;
  he has completed his arrows for the raging ones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he
  has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall
  fall into the ditch which he has made. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> His trouble shall return on his own head, and his
  unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I will give thanks to the Lord according to his
  righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a
  Psalm of David.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord, our
  Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is
  exalted above the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Out of the
  mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine
  enemies; that thou mightest put down the enemy and avenger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I will regard the heavens, the work of thy
  fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the
  son of man, that thou visitest him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory
  and honour; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and thou hast set him over
  the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> sheep and all oxen, yea and the cattle of the
  field; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> the birds of the sky, and the
  fish of the sea, the creatures passing through the paths of the sea.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy
  name in all the earth!</p>

  <h3 id="psalms9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the
  secrets of the Son.</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will give
  thanks to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will recount all thy wonderful
  works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I will be glad and exult in
  thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou Most High. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be
  feeble and perish at thy presence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For
  thou hast maintained my cause and my right; thou satest on the throne, that
  judgest righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thou hast
  rebuked the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; thou hast blotted out
  their name for ever, even for ever and ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and
  thou hast destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but the Lord endures for ever: he has
  prepared his throne for judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  he will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in
  uprightness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Lord also is become a
  refuge for the poor, a seasonable help, in affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And let them that know thy name hope in thee: for
  thou, O Lord, hast not failed them that diligently seek thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion:
  declare his dealings among the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For he remembered them, in making inquisition for
  blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my
  affliction which I suffer of mine enemies, thou that liftest me up from the
  gates of death: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that I may declare
  all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in thy
  salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The heathen are caught in
  the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their
  foot taken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The Lord is known as
  executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. A song of
  Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let sinners be driven away
  into Hades, even all the nations that forget God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the
  patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the
  heathen be judged before thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are
  men. Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Why standest thou afar
  off, O Lord? why dost thou overlook us in times of need, in affliction?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> While the ungodly one acts proudly,
  the poor is hotly pursued: the wicked are taken in the crafty counsels which
  they imagine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Because the sinner
  praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses
  himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The sinner has provoked the
  Lord: according to the abundance of his pride he will not seek after him: God
  is not before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> His ways are
  profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before him: he will gain
  the mastery over all his enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For
  he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, continuing without evil from
  generation to generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Whose mouth
  is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble
  and pain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He lies in wait with rich
  men in secret places, in order to slay the innocent: his eyes are set against
  the poor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> He lies in wait in secret
  as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor
  when he draws him after him: he will bring him down in his snare.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> He will bow down and fall when he has
  mastered the poor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For he has said in
  his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to
  look. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand
  be lifted up: forget not the poor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  Wherefore, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will
  not require it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Thou seest it; for
  thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into thy hands: the poor
  has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the orphan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Break thou the arm of the sinner and wicked man:
  his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and
  ever: ye Gentiles shall perish out his land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine
  ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man
  may no more boast upon the earth.</p>

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In
  the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the
  mountains as a sparrow? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For behold the
  sinners have bent their bow, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver,
  to shoot privily at the upright in heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For they have pulled down what thou didst frame,
  but what has the righteous done? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The
  Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his
  eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and
  he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and
  brimstone, and a stormy blast shall be the portion of their cup. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the Lord is righteous, and loves
  righteousness; his face beholds uprightness.</p>

  <p>For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for
  truth is diminished from among the children of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour:
  their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and
  the tongue that speaks great words: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord
  of us? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because of the misery of the
  poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the
  Lord, I will set them in safety; I will speak to them thereof openly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The oracles of the Lord are pure
  oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved in a furnace of earth, purified
  seven times. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou, O Lord, shalt keep
  us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. <span style=

  greatness thou has greatly exalted the sons of men.</p>

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> How

  counsel in my soul, having sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy
  be exalted over me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Look on me,
  hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> lest at any time mine enemy say, I
  have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be
  moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But I have hoped in thy mercy;
  my heart shall exult in thy salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing
  psalms to the name of the Lord most high.</p>

  <p>For the end, Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The
  fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted themselves,
  and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness,
  there is not even so much as one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The
  Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any
  that understood, or sought after god. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing,
  there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre;
  with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their
  lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to
  shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace
  they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat
  up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> There were they alarmed with fear,
  where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because
  the Lord is his hope. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Who will bring
  the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity
  of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad.</p>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord, who shall

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He that walks blameless, and works
  righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Who has not spoken craftily with is tongue,
  neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them
  that dwelt nearest to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In his
  sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the
  Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints him not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He has not lent his money on usury, and has not
  received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never
  be moved.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms15">15</h3>

  <p>A writing of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Keep me, O
  Lord; for I have hoped in thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I said
  to the Lord, Thou art my Lord; for thou has no need of my goodness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> On behalf of the saints that are in
  his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward
  they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will
  I make mention of their names with my lips. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of
  my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The lines have fallen to me in the best places,
  yea, I have a most excellent heritage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me
  even till night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I foresaw the Lord
  always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be
  moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore my heart rejoiced an
  my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
  neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou
  wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand there are
  delights for ever.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms16">16</h3>

  <p>A prayer of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hearken, O Lord
  of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not uttered
  with deceitful lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let my judgment
  come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast
  visited me by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has
  not been found in me: I am purposed that my mouth shall not speak amiss.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> As for the works of men, by the words
  of thy lips I have guarded myself from hard ways. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I have cried, for thou heardest
  me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest
  them that hope in thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Keep me as the
  apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me
  by the covering of thy wings, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> from the
  face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about
  my soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They have enclosed
  themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They have now cast me out and compassed me round
  about: they have set their eyes so as to bow them down to the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They laid wait for me as a lion ready
  for prey, and like a lion’s whelp dwelling in secret places. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down:
  deliver my soul from the ungodly: draw thy sword, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord,
  destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly
  has been filled with thy hidden treasures: they have been satisfied with
  uncleanness, and have left the remnant of their possessions to their babes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I shall appear in righteousness
  before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms17">17</h3>

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord; the words which he
  spoke to the Lord, even the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord
  delivered him out the hand of all his enemies, and out the hand of Saul: and
  he said: <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will love thee, O Lord, my
  strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The Lord is my firm support,
  and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; he
  is my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I
  shall be saved from mine enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The
  pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me
  exceedingly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The pangs of hell came
  round about me: the snares of death prevented me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord,
  and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry
  shall enter before him, even into his ears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then the earth shook and quaked, and the
  foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was
  angry with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> There went up a smoke
  in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled
  at it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he bowed the heaven, and
  came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on
  the wings of winds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he made
  darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark
  water in the clouds of the air. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> At
  the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The Lord also thundered from heaven,
  and the Highest uttered his voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And he sent forth his weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings,
  and routed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the springs of
  waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy
  rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to
  himself out of many waters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He will
  deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are
  stronger than I. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They prevented me in
  the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was my stay against them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he brought me out into a wide
  place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord will recompense me according to my
  righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For I have kept the way of the
  Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For all his judgments were before me, and his
  ordinances departed not from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Lord shall recompense me
  according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before
  his eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> With the holy thou wilt be
  holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And with the excellent man thou wilt be
  excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt
  humble the eyes of the proud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For
  thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten my darkness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For by thee shall I be delivered from
  a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of
  the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For who is God but the Lord? and
  who is a God except our God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> It is
  God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> who strengthens my feet as hart’s feet, and sets
  me upon high places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> He instructs my
  hands for war: and thou hast made my arms as a brazen bow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And thou hast made me secure in my salvation: and
  thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me to the end;
  yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Thou has made room for my goings under me, and by
  footsteps did not fail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> I will pursue
  mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are
  consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> I will dash them to pieces
  and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> For thou hast girded me with strength
  for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And thou has made mine enemies turn
  their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> They cried, but there was no
  deliverer: even to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and
  I will beat them small as dust before the wind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people:
  thou shalt make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> at the hearing of the ear they obeyed
  me: the strange children lied to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through
  lameness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> The Lord lives; and blessed
  be my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> It is God that avenges me, and has subdued the
  nations under me; <span style="color:#b00e23">​(48)</span> my deliverer from
  angry enemies: thou shalt set me on high above them that rise up against me:
  thou shalt deliver me from the unrighteous man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among
  the Gentiles, and sing to thy name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>

  thee, and were not ashamed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But I am a
  worm, and not a man; a reproach of men, and scorn of the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> All that saw me mocked me: they spoke with their
  lips, they shook the head, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He
  hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, let him save him, because he takes
  pleasure in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For thou art he that
  drew me out of the womb; my hope from my mother’s breasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I was cast on thee from the womb: thou art my God
  from my mother’s belly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Stand not
  aloof from me; for affliction is near; for there is no helper. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Many bullocks have compassed me: fat bulls have
  beset me round. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They have opened
  their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are
  loosened: my heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My strength is dried up, like a
  potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and thou hast brought me down
  to the dust of death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For many dogs
  have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: they
  pierced my hands and my feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They
  counted all my bones; and they observed and looked upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They parted my garments among themselves, and
  cast lots upon my raiment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But thou,
  O Lord, remove not my help afar off: be ready for mine aid. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Deliver my soul from the sword; my only-begotten
  one from the power of the dog. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Save
  me from the lion’s mouth; and regard my lowliness from the horns of the
  unicorns. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I will declare thy name to
  my brethren: in the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Ye that fear the Lord, praise him;
  all ye seed of Jacob, glorify him: let all the seed of Israel fear him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For he has not despised nor been
  angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but
  when I cried to him, he heard me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> My
  praise is of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them
  that fear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The poor shall eat and
  be satisfied; and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their heart shall
  live for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> All the ends of the
  earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindreds of the
  nations shall worship before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For
  the kingdom is the Lord’s; and he is the governor of the nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> All the fat ones of the earth have
  eaten and worshipped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before
  him: my soul also lives to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And
  my seed shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be reported to
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they shall report his
  righteousness to the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made.</p>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Lord tends me

  paths of righteousness, for his name’s sake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yea, even if I should walk in the midst of the
  shadow of death, I will not be afraid of evils: for thou art with me; thy rod

  them that afflict me: thou hast thoroughly anointed my head with oil; and thy
  cup cheers me like the best wine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thy
  mercy also shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling shall be
  in the house of the Lord for a very long time.</p>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> To thee, O Lord,

  have trusted in thee: let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies
  laugh me to scorn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For none of them
  that wait on thee shall in any wise be ashamed: let them be ashamed that
  transgress without cause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Shew me thy
  ways, O Lord; and teach me thy paths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art God my Saviour: and I have

  thy compassions, O Lord, and thy mercies, for they are from everlasting.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor
  my sins of ignorance: remember me according to thy mercy, for thy goodness’

  Lord: therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The meek will he guide in judgment: the meek will

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I have hated the assembly of wicked

  <h3 id="psalms26">26</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of David, before he was anointed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Lord is my light and my Saviour; whom shall I
  fear? the Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> When evil-doers drew nigh against me
  to eat up my flesh, my persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Though an army should set itself in
  array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up
  against me, in this am I confident. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: that I should
  dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, that I should behold
  the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For in the day of mine afflictions he hid me in
  his tabernacle: he sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; he set me up
  on a rock. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And now, behold, he has
  lifted up mine head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his
  tabernacle the sacrifice of joy; I will sing even sing psalms to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have
  uttered aloud: pity me, and hearken to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> My heart said to thee, I have diligently sought
  thy face: thy face, O Lord, I will seek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Turn not thy face away from me, turn not thou away
  from thy servant in anger: be thou my helper, forsake me not; and, O God my
  Saviour, overlook me not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For my
  father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me to himself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Teach me, O Lord, in thy way, and
  guide me in a right path, because of mine enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Deliver me not over to the desire of them that
  afflict me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has
  lied within herself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I believe that I
  shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. <span style=

  give them according to the works of their hands; render their recompense unto
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because they have not attended

  with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones

  among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to
  mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. <span style=

  I am become as a broken vessel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For I
  heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered
  together against me, they took counsel to take my life. <span style=

  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My lots are in thy hands:
  deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and from them that persecute me. Make thy face to
  shine upon thy servant: save me in thy mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called
  upon thee: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Let the deceitful lips become dumb,
  which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> How abundant is the multitude of thy goodness, O
  Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! thou hast wrought it
  out for them that hope on thee, in the presence of the sons of men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou wilt hide them in the secret of
  thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle
  from the contradiction of tongues. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But I said in my extreme fear, I am
  cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord,
  to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord
  seeks for truth, and renders a reward to them that deal very proudly.

  reasonings of the peoples, and brings to nought the counsels of princes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the counsel of the Lord endures
  for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is
  the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The Lord looks out of heaven; he beholds all the
  sons of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He looks from his
  prepared habitation on all the dwellers on the earth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> who fashioned their hearts alone; who understands
  all their works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A king is not saved
  by reason of a great host; and a giant shall not be delivered by the
  greatness of his strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A horse is
  vain for safety; neither shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on
  them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> to deliver their souls from death, and to keep
  them alive in famine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Our soul waits
  on the Lord; for he is our helper and defender. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him, and we have
  hoped in his holy name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let thy
  mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms33">33</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech; and he
  let him go, and he departed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will
  bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall be continually in my mouth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> My soul shall boast herself in the
  Lord: let the meek hear, and rejoice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Magnify ye the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I sought the Lord diligently, and he hearkened to
  me, and delivered me from all my sojournings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Draw near to him, and be enlightened: and your
  faces shall not by any means be ashamed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This poor man cried, and the Lord hearkened to
  him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The angel of the Lord will encamp round about them
  that fear him, and will deliver them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man who hopes in him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: for
  there is no want to them that fear him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The rich have become poor and hungry: but they
  that seek the Lord diligently shall not want any good thing. Pause.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Come, ye children, hear me: I will
  teach you the fear of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> What
  man is there that desires life, loving to see good days? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from
  speaking guile. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Turn away from evil,
  and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and
  his ears are open to their prayer: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to destroy their
  memorial from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord hearkened to them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and delivered them out of all their
  afflictions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Lord is near to them
  that are of a contrite heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but
  out of them all Lord will deliver them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He keeps all their bones: not one of them shall
  be broken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The death of sinners is
  evil: and they that hate righteousness will go wrong. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants:
  and none of those that hope in him shall go wrong.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms34">34</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Judge thou, O
  Lord, them that injure me, fight against them that fight against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Take hold of shield and buckler, and
  arise for my help. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Bring forth a
  sword, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am
  thy salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Let them that seek my
  soul be ashamed and confounded: let them that devise evils against me be
  turned back and put to shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Let them
  be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Let their way be dark and slippery,
  and an angel of the Lord persecuting them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For without cause they have hid for me their
  destructive snare: without a cause they have reproached my soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Let a snare which they know not come upon them;
  and the gin which they hid take them; and let them fall into the very same
  snare. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But my soul shall exult in the
  Lord: it shall delight in his salvation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like to
  thee? delivering the poor out of the hand of them that are stronger than he,
  yea, the poor and needy one from them that spoil him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Unjust witnesses arose, and asked me of things I
  new not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They rewarded me evil for
  good, and bereavement to my soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  I, when they troubled me, put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting:
  and my prayer shall return to my own bosom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I behaved agreeably towards them as if it had
  been our neighbour or brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of
  countenance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Yet they rejoiced
  against me, and plagues were plentifully brought against me, and I knew it
  not: they were scattered, but repented not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They tempted me, they sneered at me most
  contemptuously, they gnashed their teeth upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? Deliver my
  soul from their mischief, mine only-begotten one from the lions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I will give thanks to thee even in a great
  congregation: in an abundant people I will praise thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Let not them that are mine enemies without a
  cause rejoice against me; who hate me for nothing, and wink with their eyes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For to me they spoke peaceably, but
  imagined deceits in their anger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  they opened wide their mouth upon me; they said Aha, aha, our eyes have seen
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou hast seen it, O Lord: keep
  not silence: O Lord, withdraw not thyself from me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Awake, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, even to
  my cause, my God and my Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Judge
  me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not
  rejoice against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let them not say
  in their hearts, Aha, aha, it is pleasing to our soul: neither let them say,
  We have devoured him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Let them be
  confounded and ashamed together that rejoice at my afflictions: let them be
  clothed with shame and confusion that speak great swelling words against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Let them that rejoice in my
  righteousness exult and be glad: and let them say continually, The Lord be
  magnified, who desire the peace of his servant. <span style=

  <p>For the end, by David the servant of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The transgressor, that he may sin, says within
  himself, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For he has dealt craftily before him, to discover
  his iniquity and hate it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The words of
  his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand how
  to do good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He devises iniquity on his
  bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> O Lord, thy mercy is in the heaven;
  and thy truth reaches to the clouds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are as a great
  deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! so the
  children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of
  thine house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of thy
  delights. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For with thee is the
  fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Extend thy mercy to them that know thee; and thy
  righteousness to the upright in heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and
  let not the hand of sinners move me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast out, and shall
  not be able to stand.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms36">36</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Fret not thyself
  because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For they shall soon be withered as the
  grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the
  land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall grant
  thee the requests of thine heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he shall bring forth thy
  righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him:
  fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that
  does unlawful deeds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> ease from anger,
  and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that
  wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not
  be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
  delight themselves in the abundance of peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The sinner will watch for the righteous, and
  gnash his teeth upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the
  Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent
  their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, and to slay the upright in
  heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let their sword enter into
  their own heart, and their bows be broken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A little is better to the righteous than abundant
  wealth of sinners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the arms of
  sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their
  inheritance shall be for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They
  shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be
  satisfied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the sinners shall
  perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and
  exalted have utterly vanished like smoke. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but
  the righteous has compassion, and gives. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For they that bless him shall inherit the earth;
  and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the
  Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the
  Lord supports his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> I was once
  young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
  his seed seeking bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He is
  merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be blessed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For the Lord loves judgment,
  and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the
  blameless shall be avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly
  destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But the righteous shall
  inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom,
  and his tongue will speak of judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps
  shall not slide. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The sinner watches
  the righteous, and seeks to slay him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him
  when he is judged. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Wait on the Lord,
  and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the
  wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself,
  and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought
  him, but his place was not found. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the
  peaceable man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But the transgressors
  shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be
  utterly destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But the salvation
  of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of
  affliction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And the Lord shall help
  them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them,
  because they have hoped in him.</p>

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For my transgressions have gone over

  deceits all the day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But I, as a deaf
  man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. <span style=

  denounced a wicked word against me, saying, Now that he lies, shall he not
  rise up again? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For even the man of my
  peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But thou, O Lord, have compassion
  upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> By this I know that thou hast delighted in me,
  because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> My soul has thirsted for the living God: when
  shall I come and appear before God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My
  tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where
  is thy God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I remembered these things,
  and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of thy wondrous
  tabernacle, even to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and
  thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and
  wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him;
  he is the salvation of my countenance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember thee
  from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy
  cataracts: all thy billows and thy waves have gone over me. <span style=

  manifest it by night: with me is prayer to the God of my life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast
  thou forgotten me? wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy
  oppresses me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> While my bones were
  breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily,
  Where is thy God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Wherefore art thou
  very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I
  will give thanks to him; he is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Judge me, o God,

  countenance, while the enemy oppresses me? <span style=

  me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles. <span style=

  gladdens my youth: I will give thanks to thee on the harp, O God, my God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Wherefore art thou very sad, O my

  <p>For the end, a Psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers
  have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of
  old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thine hand utterly destroyed the
  heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the nations, and cast
  them out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For they inherited not the
  land by their own sword, and their own arm did not deliver them; but thy
  right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
  wert well pleased in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thou art
  indeed my King and my God, who commandest deliverances for Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In thee will we push down our enemies,
  and in thy name will we bring to nought them that rise up against us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For I will not trust in my bow, and my
  sword shall not save me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For thou hast
  saved us from them that afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated
  us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In God will we make our boast all
  the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But now thou hast cast off, and put us to shame;
  and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou hast turned us back before our enemies; and
  they that hated us spoiled for themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou madest us as sheep for meat; and thou
  scatteredst us among the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit by their
  exchange. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou hast made us a
  reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision them that are round about
  us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou hast made us a proverb among
  the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> All the day my shame is before me, and the
  confusion of my face has covered me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and
  avenger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> All these things are come
  upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously
  in thy covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And our heart has
  not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For thou hast laid us low in a place
  of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if
  we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these
  things out? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for he knows the secrets
  of the heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For, for thy sake we
  are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Awake, wherefore sleepest thou, O
  Lord? arise, and do not cast us off for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Wherefore turnest thou thy face away, and
  forgettest our poverty and our affliction? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For our soul has been brought down to the dust;
  our belly has cleaved to the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name’s sake.</p>

  pen of a quick writer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thou art more
  beautiful than the sons of men: grace has been shed forth on thy lips:
  therefore God has blessed thee for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty One, in
  thy comeliness, and in thy beauty; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
  ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity:
  therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy

  forget also thy people, and thy father’s house. <span style=

  fringed garments, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> in embroidered

  be brought to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They shall be
  brought with gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the king’s
  temple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Instead of thy fathers
  children are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They shall make mention of thy name

  behold the kings of the earth were assembled, they came together.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They saw, and so they wondered: they
  were troubled, they were moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Trembling took hold on them: there were the pangs as of a woman in travail.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis

  afterwards men will commend their sayings. Pause. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and
  my mouth shall declare thy praise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given it: thou wilt not take

  Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not

  righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold the man who made not God his help; but
  trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his
  vanity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I am as a fruitful olive
  in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for
  evermore. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I will give thanks to thee
  for ever, for thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good
  before the saints.</p>

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.
  They have corrupted themselves, and become abominable in iniquities: there is
  none that does good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> God looked down
  from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood,
  or sought after God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They have all
  gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none
  that does good, there is not even one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Will none of the workers of iniquity know, who devour my people as they would
  eat bread? they have not called upon God. There were they greatly afraid,
  where there was no fear: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> or God has
  scattered the bones of the men-pleasers; they were ashamed, for God despised
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Who will bring the salvation of
  Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turns the captivity of his people, Jacob
  shall exult, and Israel shall be glad.</p>

  <p>For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David, when the Ziphites came
  and said to Saul, Lo, is not David hid with us? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy
  might. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> O God, hear my prayer; hearken
  to the words of my mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they
  have not set God before them. Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For lo! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly
  destroy them in thy truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I will
  willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for it
  is good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For thou hast delivered me
  out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms54">54</h3>

  <p>For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and disregard not my
  supplication. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Attend to me, and
  hearken to me: I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> because of the voice of the enemy, and because of
  the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were
  wrathfully angry with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> My heart was
  troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness
  covered me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I said, O that I had
  wings as those of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged
  in the wilderness. Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I waited for
  him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I
  have seen iniquity and gain saying in the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Day and night he shall go round about it upon its
  walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness are in the midst of it;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and usury and craft have not failed
  from its streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For if an enemy had
  reproached me, I would have endured it; and if one who hated me had spoken
  vauntingly against me, I would have hid myself from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But thou, O man like minded, my guide, and my
  acquaintance, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> who in companionship
  with me sweetened our food: we walked in the house of God in concord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let death come upon them, and let
  them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the
  midst of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I cried to God, and
  the Lord hearkened to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Evening,
  and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known my wants: and he shall
  hear my voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He shall deliver my
  soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for they were with me in many
  cases. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> God shall hear, and bring them
  low, even he that has existed from eternity. Pause. For they suffer no
  reverse, and therefore they have not feared God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He has reached forth his hand for retribution;
  they have profaned his covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They
  were scattered at the anger of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh them.
  His words were smoother than oil, yet are they darts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain
  thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit
  of destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but
  I will hope in thee, O Lord.</p>

  trodden me down; all the day long he warring has afflicted me. <span style=

  the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They shall be afraid, but I will trust in thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In God I will praise my words; all the

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> All the day long they have abominated
  my words; all their devices are against me for evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They will dwell near and hide themselves; they
  will watch my steps, accordingly as I have waited patiently in my soul.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou wilt on no account save them;
  thou wilt bring down the people in wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> O God, I have declared my life to thee; thou has
  set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise. <span style=

  wherein I shall call upon thee; behold, I know that thou art my God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> In God, will I praise his word; in
  the Lord will I praise his saying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I
  have hoped in God; I will not be afraid of what man shall do to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The vows of thy praise, O God, which
  I will pay, are upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For thou
  hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from sliding, that I should be
  well-pleasing before God in the land of the living.</p>

  and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed

  God who has benefited me. Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He
  sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me:
  God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and he has delivered my soul from the midst of
  lions’whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men,
  their teeth are arms and missile weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Be thou exalted, O God, above the
  heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. <span style=

  bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it

  awake early. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> O Lord, I will give

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For thy mercy has been magnified even

  like water running through: he shall bend his bow till they shall fail.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They shall be destroyed as melted wax:

  For, behold, they have hunted after my soul; violent men have set upon me:
  neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord. <span style=

  Behold, they shall utter a voice with their mouth, and a sword is in their

  But thou, Lord, wilt laugh them to scorn; thou wilt utterly set at nought all
  the heathen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> will keep my strength,

  destruction be denounced: they shall fall by the wrath of utter destruction,

  return at evening, and be hungry as a dog, and go round about the city.

  Thou hast shewn thy people hard things: thou has made us drink the wine of

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David, for alternate strains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Save me, O God; for the waters have come in to my
  soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I am stuck fast in deep mire,
  and there is no standing: I am come in to the depths of the sea, and a storm
  has overwhelmed me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I am weary of
  crying, my throat has become hoarse; mine eyes have failed by my waiting on
  my God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They that hate me without a
  cause are more than the hairs of my head: my enemies that persecute me
  unrighteously are strengthened: then I restored that which I took not away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> O God, thou knowest my foolishness;
  and my transgressions are not hidden from thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord of hosts,
  be ashamed on my account: let not them that seek thee, be ashamed on my
  account, O God of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For I have
  suffered reproach for thy sake; shame has covered my face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I became strange to my brethren, and a stranger to
  my mother’s children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For the zeal of
  thine house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee
  are fallen upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I bowed down
  my soul with fasting, and that was made my reproach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I put on sackcloth for my covering; and I
  became a proverb to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They that
  sit in the gate talked against me, and they that drank wine sang against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But I will cry to thee, O Lord, in my
  prayer; O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of thy mercy hear
  me, in the truth of thy salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Save me from the mire, that I stick not in it: let me be delivered from them
  that hate me, and from the deep waters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let not the waterflood drown me, nor let the deep
  swallow me up; neither let the well shut its mouth upon me. <span style=

  to the multitude of thy compassions look upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And turn not away thy face from thy servant; for
  I am afflicted: hear me speedily. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Draw nigh to my soul and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For thou knowest my reproach, and my
  shame, and my confusion; all that afflict me are before thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> My soul has waited for reproach and misery; and I
  waited for one to grieve with me, but there was none; and for one to comfort
  me, but I found none. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They gave me
  also gall for my food, and made me drink vinegar for my thirst. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let their table before them be for a snare, and
  for a recompense, and for a stumbling-block. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Let their eyes be darkened that they should not
  see; and bow down their back continually. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Pour out thy wrath upon them, and let the fury of
  thine anger take hold on them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let
  their habitation be made desolate; and let there be no inhabitant in their
  tents: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Because they persecuted him
  whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Add iniquity to their iniquity; and
  let them not come into thy righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of the
  living, and let them not be written with the righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> I am poor and sorrowful; but the salvation of thy
  countenance has helped me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I will
  praise the name of my God with a song, I will magnify him with praise;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and this shall please God more than a
  young calf having horns and hoofs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Let the poor see and rejoice; seek the Lord diligently, and ye shall live.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> For the Lord hears the poor, and does
  not set at nought his fettered ones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  Let the heavens and the earth raise him, the sea, and all things moving in
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> For God will save Sion, and the
  cities of Judea shall be built; and men shall dwell there, and inherit it.

  from the hand of the transgressor and unjust man. <span style=

  my hope from my youth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> On thee have I
  been stayed from the womb: from the belly of my mother thou art my protector:
  of thee is my praise continually. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I am
  become as it were a wonder to many: but thou art my strong helper.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Let my mouth be filled with praise,
  that I may hymn thy glory, and thy majesty all the day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Cast me not off at the time of old age; forsake me
  not when my strength fails. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For mine
  enemies have spoken against me; and they that lay wait for my soul have taken
  counsel together, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> saying, God has
  forsaken him: persecute ye and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> O God, go not far from me, O my God,
  draw nigh to my help. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let those that
  plot against my soul be ashamed and utterly fail: let those that seek my hurt
  be clothed with shame and dishonour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  But I will hope continually, and will praise thee more and more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly,
  and thy salvation all the day; for I am not acquainted with the affairs of
  men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I will go on in the might of the
  Lord: O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness only. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, and
  until now will I declare thy wonders; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  even until I am old and advanced in years. O God, forsake me not; until I
  shall have declared thine arm to all the generation that is to come:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> even thy power and thy righteousness,
  O God, up to the highest heavens, even the mighty works which thou has done:
  O God, who is like to thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> What
  afflictions many and sore hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn and
  quicken me, and broughtest me again from the depths of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou didst multiply thy
  righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, and broughtest me again out of
  the depths of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I will also
  therefore give thanks to thee, O God, because of thy truth, on an instrument
  of psalmody: I will sing psalms to thee on the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> My lips shall rejoice when I sing to
  thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. <span style=

  to Israel, to the upright in heart! <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I was jealous of the
  transgressors, beholding the tranquility of sinners. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For there is no sign of reluctance in their death:
  and they have firmness under their affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They are not in the troubles of other men; and
  they shall not be scourged with other men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore pride has possessed them; they have
  clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness:
  they have fulfilled their intention. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered
  unrighteousness loftily. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They have set
  their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore shall my people return
  hither: and full days shall be found with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they said, How does God know? and is there
  knowledge in the Most High? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Behold,
  these are the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed
  wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I said, Verily in vain
  have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof was
  every morning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If I said, I will
  speak thus; behold, I should have broken covenant with the generation of thy
  children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I undertook to
  understand this, but it is too hard for me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> until I go into the sanctuary of God; and so
  understand the latter end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Surely
  thou hast appointed judgments to them because of their crafty dealings: thou
  hast cast them down when they were lifted up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> How have they become desolate! suddenly they have
  failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in thy

  For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been gladdened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But I was vile and knew not: I became brutish

  taken me to thyself with glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For
  what have I in heaven but thee? and what have I desired upon the earth beside
  thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> My heart and my flesh have
  failed: but God is the strength of my heart, and God is my portion for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For, behold, they that remove
  themselves far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed every one that
  goes a whoring from thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But it is
  good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may
  proclaim all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>

  this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwelt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Lift up thine hands against their pride
  continually; because of all that the enemy has done wickedly in thy holy

  boasted in the midst of thy feast; they have set up their standards for
  signs, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> ignorantly as it were in the
  entrance above; (6) they cut down its doors at once with axes as in a wood of
  trees; they have broken it down with hatchet and stone cutter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They have burnt thy sanctuary with fire to the
  ground; they have profaned the habitation of thy name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They have said in their heart, even all their
  kindred together, Come, let us abolish the feasts of the Lord from the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> We have not seen our signs; there is
  no longer a prophet; and God will not know us any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? shall
  the enemy provoke thy name forever? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Wherefore turnest thou away thine hand, and thy right hand from the midst of
  thy bosom for ever? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But God is our
  King of old; he has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou didst establish the sea, in thy might, thou
  didst break to pieces the heads of the dragons in the water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou didst break to pieces the heads of the
  dragon; thou didst give him for meat to the Ethiopian nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thou didst cleave fountains and torrents; thou
  driedst up mighty rivers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The day is
  thine, and the night is thine; thou hast prepared the sun and the moon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou hast made all the borders of the
  earth; thou hast made summer and spring. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Remember this thy creation: an enemy has
  reproached the Lord, and a foolish people has provoked thy name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Deliver not to the wild beasts a soul that gives
  praise to thee: forget not for ever the souls of thy poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Look upon thy covenant: for the dark places of
  the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> let not the afflicted and shamed one be rejected:
  the poor and needy shall praise thy name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Arise, O God, plead thy cause: remember thy
  reproaches that come from the foolish one all the day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Forget not the voice of thy suppliants: let the
  pride of them that hate thee continually ascend before thee.</p>

  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou art terrible; and who shall withstand thee,

  <p>For the end, for Idithun, a Psalm of Asaph. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I cried to the Lord with my voice, yea, my voice
  was addressed to God; and he gave heed to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In the day of mine affliction I earnestly sought
  the Lord; even with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my

  remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted.
  Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> All mine enemies set a watch

  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I considered the days of old, and remembered

  communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and
  will he be well pleased no more? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Will
  he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever? <span style=

  of waters: the clouds uttered a voice; for thine arrows went abroad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The voice of thy thunder was abroad,
  and around thy lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths

  <h3 id="psalms77">77</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of instruction for Asaph. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I will open my mouth in parables: I
  will utter dark sayings which have been from the beginning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> All which we have heard and known, and our fathers
  have declared to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They were not hid
  from their children to a second generations; the fathers declaring the
  praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he raised up a testimony in Jacob,
  and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it
  known to their children: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> that another
  generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should
  arise and declare them to their children. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> That they might set their hope on God, and not
  forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> That they should not be as their fathers, a
  perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart
  aright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting with
  the bow, turned back in the day of battle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and would not
  walk in his law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they forgot his
  benefits, and his miracles which he had shewed them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> the miracles which he wrought before their
  fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He clave the sea, and led them through: he made
  the waters to stand as in a bottle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of
  fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> he clave a rock in the
  wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he brought water out of the rock, and caused
  waters to flow down as rivers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And
  they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the
  wilderness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they tempted God in
  their hearts, in asking meat for the desire of their souls. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They spoke also against God, and said, Will God
  be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters
  flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread,
  or prepare a table for his people? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob,
  and wrath went up against Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Yet he commanded the clouds from
  above, and opened the doors of heaven, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them
  the bread of heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Man ate angels’
  bread; he sent them provision to the full. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his
  might he brought in the south-west wind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and
  feathered birds like the sand of the seas. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they fell into the midst of their camp, round
  about their tents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> So they ate, and
  were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> They were not disappointed of their desire: but
  when their food was yet in their mouth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> then the indignation of God rose up against them,
  and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> In the midst of all this they sinned
  yet more, and believed not his miracles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And their days were consumed in vanity, and their
  years with anxiety. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> When he slew
  them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they remembered that God was
  their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Yet they loved him only with their mouth, and
  lied to him with their tongue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For
  their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his
  covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But he is compassionate,
  and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy them: yea, he will
  frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he remembered that they are
  flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> How often did they provoke him in the wilderness,
  and anger him in a dry land! <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Yea,
  they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> They remembered not his hand, the day
  in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his
  wonders in the field of Tanes: <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and
  had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not
  drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> He sent against them the
  dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And he gave their fruit to the canker
  worm, and their labours to the locust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> He killed their vines with hail, and their
  sycamores with frost. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And he gave up
  their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> He sent out against them the fury of his anger,
  wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> He made a way for his wrath; he
  spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> and smote every first-born in the
  land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And he removed his people like sheep;
  he led them as a flock in the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And he guided them with hope, and they feared
  not: but the sea covered their enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And he brought them in to the mountain of his
  sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And he cast out the nations from before them, and
  made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel
  to dwell in their tents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Yet they
  tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And they turned back, and broke
  covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And they provoked him with their high
  places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> God heard and lightly regarded them, and greatly
  despised Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And he rejected the
  tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And he gave their strength into captivity, and
  their beauty into the enemy’s hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span>
  And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> Fire devoured their young men; and
  their virgins mourned not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Their
  priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(65)</span> So the Lord awaked as one out of
  sleep, and as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he
  brought on them a perpetual reproach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span>
  And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> but chose the tribe of Juda, the
  mount Sion which he loved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> And he
  built his sanctuary as the place of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> He chose David also his
  servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(71)</span> He took him from following the ewes great with
  young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(72)</span> So he tended them in the innocency of
  his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>

  Israel gave no heed to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So I let

  I should have put down their enemies very quickly, and should have laid my

  The Lord’s enemies should have lied to him: but their time shall be for ever.

  any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. <span style=

  thou shalt trample on the lion and dragon. <span style=

  will protect him, because he has known my name. <span style=

  <p>A Psalm of a Song for the Sabbath-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, and
  to sing praises to thy name, O thou Most High; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to proclaim thy mercy in the morning, and thy
  truth by night, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> on a psaltery of ten
  strings, with a song on the harp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For
  thou, O Lord, hast made me glad with thy work: and in the operations of thy
  hands will I exult. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> How have thy works
  been magnified, O Lord! thy thoughts are very deep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> A foolish man will not know, and a senseless man
  will not understand this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> When the
  sinners spring up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity have watched;
  it is that they may be utterly destroyed for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But thou, O Lord, art most high for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For, behold, thine enemies shall
  perish; and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But my horn shall be exalted as the horn of a
  unicorn; and mine old age with rich mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And mine eye has seen mine enemies, and mine ear
  shall hear the wicked that rise up against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The righteous shall flourish as a palm-tree: he
  shall be increased as the cedar in Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They that are planted in the house of the Lord
  shall flourish in the courts of our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then shall they be increased in a fine old age;
  and they shall be prosperous; that they may declare <span style=

  no iniquity in him.</p>

  himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be
  moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thy throne is prepared of old:
  thou art from everlasting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The rivers

  sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places. <span style=

  becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever.</p>

  <h3 id="psalms93">93</h3>

  <p>A Psalm of David for the fourth day of the week. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Lord is a God of vengeance; the God of
  vengeance has declared himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Be
  thou exalted, thou that judgest the earth: render a reward to the proud.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> How long shall sinners, O Lord, how
  long shall sinners boast? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They will
  utter and speak unrighteousness; all the workers of iniquity will speak so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They have afflicted thy people, O
  Lord, and hurt thine heritage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They
  have slain the widow and fatherless, and murdered the stranger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither
  shall the God of Jacob understand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Understand now, ye simple among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He that planted the ear, does he not
  hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He that chastises the heathen, shall not he
  punish, even he that teaches man knowledge? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are
  vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Blessed is the man whomsoever
  thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and shalt teach him out of thy law; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> to give him rest from evil days, until a pit be
  digged for the sinful one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the
  Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> until righteousness return to
  judgment, and all the upright in heart shall follow it. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Who will rise up for me against the
  transgressors? or who will stand up with me against the workers of iniquity?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If the Lord had not helped me, my
  soul had almost sojourned in Hades. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  If I said, My foot has been moved; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  thy mercy, O Lord, helped me. O Lord, according to the multitude of my griefs
  within my heart, thy consolation have soothed my soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with
  thee, which frames mischief by an ordinance? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They will hunt for the soul of the righteous, and
  condemn innocent blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But the Lord
  was my refuge; and my God the helper of my hope. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he will recompense to them their iniquity and
  their wickedness: the Lord our God shall utterly destroy them.</p>

  among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They shall give drink to all the wild beasts of
  the field: the wild asses shall take of them to quench their thirst.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> By them shall the birds of the sky
  lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He waters the mountains from his chambers: the
  earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He makes grass to grow for the cattle, and green
  herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his
  face cheerful with oil: and bread strengthens man’s heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The trees of the plain shall be full of sap; even
  the cedars of Libanus which he has planted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> There the sparrows will build their nests; and
  the house of the heron takes the lead among them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The high mountains are a refuge for the stags,
  and the rock for the rabbits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He
  appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it
  all the wild beasts of the forest will be abroad: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> even young lions roaring for prey, and to seek
  meat for themselves from God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The sun
  arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their
  dens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Man shall go forth to his work,
  and to his labour till evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> How
  great are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou wrought them all: the earth
  is filled with thy creation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So is
  this great and wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, small animals
  and great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> There go the ships; and
  this dragon whom thou hast made to play in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> All wait upon thee, to give them their food in
  due season. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> When thou hast given it
  them, they will gather it; and when thou hast opened thine hand, they shall
  all be filled with good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But when
  thou hast turned away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou wilt take away
  their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, and they shall
  be created; and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Let the glory of the Lord be for ever: the Lord
  shall rejoice in his works; <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> who looks
  upon the earth, and makes it tremble; who touches the mountains, and they
  smoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> I will sing to the Lord while
  I live; I will sing praise to my God while I exist. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Let my meditation be sweet to him: and I will
  rejoice in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Let the sinners
  fail from off the earth, and transgressors, so that they shall be no more.
  Bless the Lord, O my soul.</p>

  servants, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He has remembered his
  covenant for ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generation:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> which he established as a covenant to
  Abraam, and he remembered his oath to Isaac. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he established it to Jacob for an ordinance,
  and to Israel for an everlasting covenant; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> saying To thee will I give the land of Chanaan,
  the line of your inheritance: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> when
  they were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they went from nation to nation, and from one
  kingdom to another people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He
  suffered no man to wrong them; and he rebuked kings for their sakes:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> saying, Touch not my anointed ones;
  and do my prophets no harm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Moreover
  he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He sent a man before them; Joseph was
  sold for a slave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They hurt his feet
  with fetters; his soul passed into iron, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> until the time that his cause came on; the word
  of the Lord tried him as fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The
  king sent and loosed him; even the prince of the people, and let him go free.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He made him Lord over his house, and
  ruler of all his substance; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> to
  chastise his rulers at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Israel also came into Egypt, and
  Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their
  enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he turned their heart to
  hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He sent fort Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he
  had chosen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He established among them
  his signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He sent forth darkness, and made it dark; yet
  they rebelled against his words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> He
  turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the
  chambers of their kings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> He spoke,
  and the dog-fly came, and lice in all their coasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> He turned their rain into hail, and sent flaming
  fire in their land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he smote
  their vines and their fig trees; and broke every tree of their coast.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> He spoke, and the locust came, and
  caterpillars innumerable, <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> and
  devoured all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> He smote also every first-born of
  their land, the first-fruits of all their labour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he brought them out with silver and gold; and
  there was not a feeble one among their tribes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for the fear
  of them fell upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> He spread out
  a cloud for a covering to them, and fire to give them light by night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> They asked, and the quail came, and
  he satisfied them with the bread of heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> He clave the rock, and the waters flowed, rivers
  ran in dry places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> For he remembered
  his holy word, which he promised to Abraam his servant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And he brought out his people with exultation,
  and his chosen with joy; <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and gave
  them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labours of the people;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> that they might keep his ordinances,

  shall cause all his praises to be heard? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do

  may glory with thine inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> We
  have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have done
  unrighteously. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Our fathers in Egypt
  understood not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy;
  but provoked him as they went up by the Red Sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he
  might cause his mighty power to be known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up:
  so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he saved them out of the hand of them that
  hated them, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The water covered those that oppressed them:
  there was not one of them left. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then
  they believed his words, and celebrated his praise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They made haste, they forgot his works; they
  waited not for his counsel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they
  lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he gave them their request, and
  sent fullness into their souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They
  provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The earth opened and swallowed up
  Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and
  a flame burnt up the sinners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and they changed their glory into the similitude
  of a calf that feeds on grass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They
  forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> wondrous works in the land of Cham,
  and terrible things at the Red Sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
  before him in the breach, to turn him away from the fierceness of his anger,
  so that he should not destroy them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they murmured in their tents:
  they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast
  them down in the wilderness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and to
  cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> They were joined also to Beelphegor,
  and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and destruction, was multiplied among
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Then Phinees stood up, and made
  atonement: and the plague ceased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And
  it was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> They provoked him also at the water
  of Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> for they provoked his spirit, and he spoke
  unadvisedly with his lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> They
  destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them to destroy; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> but were mingled with the heathen, and learned
  their works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And they served their
  graven images; and it became an offence to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And they sacrificed their sons and their
  daughters to devils, <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> and shed
  innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed
  to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was defiled with blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and was polluted with their works; and they went
  a whoring with their own devices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> So
  the Lord was very angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he delivered them into the hands
  of their enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Ands their enemies oppressed them, and they were
  brought down under their hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Many
  a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they
  were brought low by their iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span>
  Ye the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their petition.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And he remembered his covenant, and
  repented according to the multitude of his mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And he caused them to be pitied in the sight of
  all who carried them captive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Save
  us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give
  thanks to thy holy name, that we may glory in thy praise. <span style=

  They wandered in the wilderness in a dry land; they found no way to a city of
  habitation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Hungry and thirsty, their

  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So their heart was brought low with troubles;
  they were weak, and there was no helper. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction,

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Their soul abhorred all meat; and
  they drew near to the gates of death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he saved them out of

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> They are troubled, they stagger as a

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> He turns rivers into a desert, and

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> He turns a wilderness into pools of

  <p>For the end, a Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O

  crafty man have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a
  crafty tongue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they have compassed
  me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but
  I continued to pray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they rewarded
  me evil for good, and hatred for my love. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Set thou a sinner against him; and let the devil
  stand at his right hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> When he is
  judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Let his days be few: and let another
  take his office of overseer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Let his
  children be orphans, and his wife a widow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let his children wander without a dwelling-place,
  and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let his creditor exact all that belongs to him:
  and let strangers spoil his labours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on
  his fatherless children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let his
  children be given up to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be
  blotted out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Let the iniquity of his
  fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be
  blotted out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let them be before the
  Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because he remembered not to shew
  mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and that to slay him that was
  pricked in the heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He loved
  cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in
  blessing, so it shall be removed far from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is
  come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on,
  and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> This is the dealing of the Lord with those who
  falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me,
  for thy name’s sake: for thy mercy is good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart
  is troubled within me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I am removed
  as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> My knees are weakened through
  fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of the want of oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> I became also a reproach to them: when they saw
  me they shook their heads. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Help me, O
  Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And let them know that this is thy hand; and that
  thou, Lord, hast wrought it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Let them
  curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but
  let thy servant rejoice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Let those
  that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves
  with their shame as with a mantle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I
  will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of
  many I will praise him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For he stood
  on the right hand of the poor, to save me from them that persecute my
  soul.</p>

  <p>A Psalm of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Lord said to

  repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The Lord at thy right hand has dashed
  in pieces kings in the day of his wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up
  the number of corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth.

  not thy law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> At midnight I arose, to
  give thanks to thee for the judgments of thy righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and
  of them that keep thy commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> O
  Lord, the earth is full of thy mercy: teach me thine ordinances. 9
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(65)</span> Thou hast wrought kindly with thy
  servant, o Lord, according to thy word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(66)</span> Teach me kindness, and instruction, and
  knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(67)</span> Before I was afflicted, I transgressed; therefore
  have I kept thy word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> Good art thou,
  O Lord; therefore in thy goodness teach me thine ordinances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(69)</span> The injustice of the proud has been multiplied
  against me: but I will search out thy commandments with all my heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> Their heart has been curdled like
  milk; but I have meditated on thy law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(71)</span> It is good for me that thou hast afflicted me;
  that I might learn thine ordinances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(72)</span>
  The law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver. 10
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(73)</span> Thy hands have made me, and fashioned
  me: instruct me, that I may learn thy commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(74)</span> They that fear thee will see me and rejoice: for
  I have hoped in thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(75)</span> I know, O
  Lord, that thy judgments are righteousness, and that thou in truthfulness
  hast afflicted me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(76)</span> Let, I pray thee,
  thy mercy be to comfort me, according to thy word to thy servant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(77)</span> Let thy compassions come to me, that
  I may live: for thy law is my meditation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(78)</span> Let the proud be ashamed; for they transgressed
  against me unjustly: but I will meditate in thy commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(79)</span> Let those that fear thee, and those that know thy
  testimonies, turn to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(80)</span> Let mine
  heart be blameless in thine ordinances, that I may not be ashamed. 11
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(81)</span> My soul faints for thy salvation: I
  have hoped in thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(82)</span> Mine eyes
  failed in waiting for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(83)</span> For I am become as a bottle in the
  frost: yet I have not forgotten thine ordinances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(84)</span> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt
  thou execute judgment for me on them that persecute me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(85)</span> Transgressors told me idle tales; but not
  according to thy law, O Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(86)</span> All thy
  commandments are truth; they persecuted me unjustly; help thou me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(87)</span> They nearly made an end of me in the
  earth; but I forsook not thy commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(88)</span> Quicken me according to thy mercy; so shall I
  keep the testimonies of thy mouth. 12 <span style="color:#b00e23">(89)</span>
  Thy word, O Lord, abides in heaven for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(90)</span> Thy truth endures to all generations; thou hast
  founded the earth, and it abides. <span style="color:#b00e23">(91)</span> The
  day continues by thy arrangement; for all things are thy servants.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(92)</span> Were it not that thy law is my
  meditation, then I should have perished in mine affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(93)</span> I will never forget thine ordinances; for with
  them thou hast quickened me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(94)</span> I am
  thine, save me; for I have sought out thine ordinances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(95)</span> Sinners laid wait for me to destroy me; but I
  understood thy testimonies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(96)</span> have seen
  an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is very broad. 13 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(97)</span> How I have loved thy law, O Lord! it is my
  meditation all the day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(98)</span> Thou hast
  made me wiser than mine enemies in thy commandment; for it is mine for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(99)</span> I have more understanding than all my
  teachers; for thy testimonies are my medication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(100)</span> I understand more that the aged; because I have
  sought out thy commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(101)</span> I have
  kept back my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy words.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(102)</span> I have not declined from thy
  judgments; for thou hast instructed me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(103)</span> How sweet are thine oracles to my throat! more
  so than honey to my mouth! <span style="color:#b00e23">(104)</span> I gain
  understanding by thy commandments: therefore I have hated every way of
  unrighteousness. 14 <span style="color:#b00e23">(105)</span> Thy law is a
  lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(106)</span> I have sworn and determined to keep the
  judgments of thy righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(107)</span> I
  have been very greatly afflicted, O Lord: quicken me, according to thy word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(108)</span> Accept, I pray thee, O Lord, the
  freewill-offerings of my mouth, and teach me thy judgments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(109)</span> My soul is continually in thine hands; and I
  have not forgotten thy law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(110)</span> Sinners
  spread a snare for me; but I erred not from thy commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(111)</span> I have inherited thy testimonies for ever; for
  they are the joy of my heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(112)</span> I have
  inclined my heart to perform thine ordinances for ever, in return for thy
  mercies. 15 <span style="color:#b00e23">(113)</span> I have hated
  transgressors; but I have loved thy law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(114)</span> Thou art my helper and my supporter; I have
  hoped in thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(115)</span> Depart from me,
  ye evil-doers; for I will search out the commandments of my God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(116)</span> Uphold me according to thy word, and quicken me;
  and make me not ashamed of my expectation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(117)</span> Help me, and I shall be saved; and I will
  meditate in thine ordinances continually. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(118)</span> Thou hast brought to nought all that depart from
  thine ordinances; for their inward thought is unrighteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(119)</span> I have reckoned all the sinners of the earth as
  transgressors; therefore have I loved thy testimonies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(120)</span> Penetrate my flesh with thy fear; for I am
  afraid of thy judgments. 16 <span style="color:#b00e23">(121)</span> I have
  done judgment and justice; deliver me not up to them that injure me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(122)</span> Receive thy servant for good: let
  not the proud accuse me falsely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(123)</span>
  Mine eyes have failed for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(124)</span> Deal with thy servant
  according to thy mercy, and teach me thine ordinances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(125)</span> I am thy servant; instruct me, and I shall know
  thy testimonies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(126)</span> It is time for the
  Lord to work: they have utterly broken thy law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(127)</span> Therefore have I loved thy commandments more
  than gold, or the topaz. <span style="color:#b00e23">(128)</span> Therefore I
  directed myself according to all thy commandments: I have hated every unjust
  way. 17 <span style="color:#b00e23">(129)</span> Thy testimonies are
  wonderful: therefore my soul has sought them out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(130)</span> The manifestation of thy words will enlighten,
  and instruct the simple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(131)</span> I opened my
  mouth, and drew breath: for I earnestly longed after thy commandments.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(132)</span> Look upon me and have mercy upon me,
  after the manner of them that love thy name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(133)</span> Order my steps according to thy word: and let
  not any iniquity have dominion over me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(134)</span> Deliver me from the false accusation of men: so
  will I keep thy commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(135)</span> Cause
  thy face to shine upon thy servant: and teach me thine ordinances.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(136)</span> Mine eyes have been bathed in
  streams of water, because I kept not thy law. 18 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(137)</span> Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy
  judgments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(138)</span> Thou has commanded
  righteousness and perfect truth, as thy testimonies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(139)</span> Thy zeal has quite wasted me: because mine
  enemies have forgotten thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(140)</span>
  Thy word has been very fully tried; and thy servant loves it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(141)</span> I am young and despised: yet I have not
  forgotten thine ordinances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(142)</span> Thy
  righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(143)</span> Afflictions and distresses found me:
  but thy commandments were my meditation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(144)</span> Thy testimonies are an everlasting
  righteousness: instruct me, and I shall live. 19 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(145)</span> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I
  will search out thine ordinances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(146)</span> I
  cried to thee; save me, and I will keep thy testimonies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(147)</span> I arose before the dawn, and cried: I hoped in
  thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(148)</span> Mine eyes prevented the
  dawn, that I might meditate on thine oracles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(149)</span> Hear my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy;
  quicken me according to thy judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(150)</span> They have drawn nigh who persecuted me
  unlawfully; and they are far removed from thy law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(151)</span> Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy ways are
  truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(152)</span> I have known of old
  concerning thy testimonies, that thou hast founded them for ever. 20
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(153)</span> Look upon mine affliction, and
  rescue me; for I have not forgotten thy law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(154)</span> Plead my cause, and ransom me: quicken me
  because of thy word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(155)</span> Salvation is
  far from sinners: for they have not searched out thine ordinances.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(156)</span> Thy mercies, O Lord, are many:
  quicken me according to thy judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(157)</span> Many are they that persecute me and oppress me:
  but I have not declined from thy testimonies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(158)</span> I beheld men acting foolishly, and I pined away;
  for they kept not thine oracles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(159)</span>
  Behold, I have loved thy commandments, O Lord: quicken me in thy mercy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(160)</span> The beginning of thy words is truth;
  and all the judgments of thy righteousness endure for ever. 21 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(161)</span> Princes persecuted me without a cause, but my
  heart feared because of thy words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(162)</span> I
  will exult because of thine oracles, as one that finds much spoil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(163)</span> I hate and abhor unrighteousness;
  but I love thy law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(164)</span> Seven times in a
  day have I praised thee because of the judgments of thy righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(165)</span> Great peace have they that love thy
  law: and there is no stumbling-block to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(166)</span> I waited for thy salvation, O Lord, and have
  loved thy commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(167)</span> My soul has
  kept thy testimonies, and loved them exceedingly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(168)</span> I have kept thy commandments and thy
  testimonies; for all my ways are before thee, O Lord. 22 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(169)</span> Let my supplication come near before thee, o
  Lord; instruct me according to thine oracle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(170)</span> Let my petition come in before thee, O Lord;
  deliver me according to thine oracle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(171)</span> Let my lips utter a hymn, when thou shalt have
  taught me thine ordinances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(172)</span> Let my
  tongue utter thine oracles; for all thy commandments are righteous.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(173)</span> Let thine hand be prompt to save me;
  for I have chosen thy commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(174)</span>
  I have longed after thy salvation, O Lord; and thy law is my meditation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(175)</span> My soul shall live, and shall praise
  thee; and thy judgments shall help me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(176)</span> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy
  servant; for I have not forgotten thy commandments.</p>

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Jerusalem is built as a city whose

  the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to
  give thanks unto the name of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  For there are set thrones for judgment, even thrones for the house of David.

  <p>A Song of Degrees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord, my heart
  is not exalted, neither have mine eyes been haughtily raised: neither have I
  exercised myself in great matters, nor in things too wonderful for me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I shall have sinned if I have not been
  humble, but have exulted my soul: according to the relation of a weaned child

  <p>A Song of Degrees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Lord, remember
  David, and all his meekness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> how he
  sware to the Lord, and vowed to the God of Jacob, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will not go into the tabernacle of my house; I
  will not go up to the couch of my bed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to
  my temples, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> until I find a place for
  the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Behold, we heard of it in Ephratha; we found it in
  the fields of the wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Let us enter
  into his tabernacles: let us worship at the place where his feet stood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou,
  and the ark of thine holiness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thy
  priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; and thy saints shall
  exult. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the sake of thy servant
  David turn not away the face of thine anointed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Lord sware in truth to David, and he will not
  annul it, saying, Of the fruit of thy body will I set a king upon thy throne.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If thy children will deep my
  covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them, their children
  also shall sit upon thy throne for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For the Lord has elected Sion, he has chosen her
  for a habitation for himself, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have chosen it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I will surely bless her provision: I
  will satisfy her poor with bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I
  will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall greatly exult.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> There will I cause to spring up a
  horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> His enemies will I clothe with a shame; but upon
  himself shall my holiness flourish.</p>

  the beard, even the beard of Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his

  <p>For David, a Psalm of Jeremias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> By

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> We hung our harps on the willows in
  the midst of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For there they that
  had taken us captive asked of us the words of a song; and they that had
  carried us away asked a hymn, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> How should we sing the Lord’s song in
  a strange land? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If I forget thee, O
  Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. <span style=

  remember thee; if I do not prefer Jerusalem as the chief of my joy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom
  in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to its foundations.

  fashioned me, and laid thine hand upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The knowledge of thee is too wonderful for me; it
  is very difficult, I cannot attain to it. <span style=

  vain, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for even there thy hand would

  reins; thou hast helped me from my mother’s womb. <span style=

  wondrous; wondrous are thy works; and my soul knows it well. <span style=

  hidden from thee, nor my substance, in the lowest parts of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thine eyes saw my unwrought
  substance, and all men shall be written in thy book; they shall be formed by
  day, though there should for a time be no one among them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But thy friends, O God, have been greatly
  honoured by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I will number them, and they shall be multiplied
  beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O God;
  depart from me, ye men of blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For
  thou wilt say concerning their thought, that they shall take thy cities in
  vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Have I not hated them, O Lord,
  that hate thee? and wasted away because of thine enemies? <span style=

  <p>David’s Psalm of praise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will
  exalt thee, my God, my king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Every day will I bless thee, and I
  will praise thy name for ever and ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and
  there is no end to his greatness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Generation after generation shall praise thy works, and tell of thy power.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they shall speak of the glorious
  majesty of thy holiness, and recount thy wonders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they shall speak of the power of thy terrible
  acts; and recount thy greatness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They
  shall utter the memory of the abundance of thy goodness, and shall exult in
  thy righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The Lord is
  compassionate, and merciful; long suffering, and abundant in mercy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Lord is good to those that wait on
  him; and his compassions are over all his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let all thy works, O Lord, give thanks to thee;
  and let thy saints bless thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They
  shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy dominion;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> to make known to the sons of men thy
  power, and the glorious majesty of thy kingdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy
  dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is faithful in his words,
  and holy in all his works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The Lord
  supports all that are falling, and sets up all that are broken down.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and
  thou givest them their food in due season. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thou openest thine hands, and fillest every
  living thing with pleasure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The Lord
  is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to
  all that call upon him in truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He
  will perform the desire of them that fear him: and he will hear their
  supplication, and save them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The Lord
  preserves all that love him: but all sinners he will utterly destroy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of
  the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#000000">This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I was small among my brethren, and
  youngest in my father’s house: I tended my father’s sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> My hands formed a musical instrument, and my
  fingers tuned a psaltery. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And who
  shall tell my Lord? the Lord himself, he himself hears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He sent forth his angel, and took me from my
  father’s sheep, and he anointed me with the oil of his anointing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> My brothers were handsome and tall;
  but the Lord did not take pleasure in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I went forth to meet the Philistine; and he cursed
  me by his idols. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I drew his own

  Israel.</p>
