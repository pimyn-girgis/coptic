  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> (The) beginning of the Gospel of
  Jesus Christ, (the) Son of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  According as it is written in Esaias the prophet: Lo, I will send (the)
  messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy road before thee;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> (the) cry of him who crieth out in
  (the) desert: "Prepare (the) road of the Lord, make straight his paths."'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And John the Baptist was in (the)
  desert, and preaching a baptism of repentance for (lit. in) a forgiveness of
  sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And there were coining forth to
  him they of all Judea-country, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were being
  baptised by him in the Jordan-river, confessing their sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And John was (imperf.) clothed with camel's hair,
  and girt with a girdle of leather upon his loins, and he ate (imperf.) locust
  and honey of (the) field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he was
  preaching, saying: He who is stronger than I cometh after me, he (of) whom I
  am not worthy to stoop down to unloose a latchet of his shoe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I baptised you in water: but he will baptise you
  in the (lit. a) Holy Spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it
  came to pass in those days, (that) Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and
  was baptised in the Jordan by John. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens rent, and the
  Spirit came down upon him as a dove: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  and there was (imperf.) a voice from the heavens:'Thou art my Son, my
  beloved, in whom I was well pleased.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And immediately the Spirit drove him forth to (the) desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he was (imperf.) in (the) desert forty days
  and nights, Satan tempting him; and he was (imperf.) with the wild beasts;
  and the angels were ministering to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Now after that John was delivered (up), Jesus
  came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and saying: 'The time was fulfilled, and the
  kingdom of God approached: repent, and believe the gospel.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And having passed by (the) sea of Galilee, he saw
  Simon and Andrew (the) brother of Simon casting net into the sea: because
  they were fishers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jesus said to
  them: Come, walk after me, and I (will) make you fishers, catchers of men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they left the nets, they
  immediately walked after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  having passed on a little further, he saw James (the) son of Zebedee, and
  John his brother; and they also being in the ship, preparing their nets.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And immediately he called them: and
  they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired-servants, they went
  (away), they walked after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  they went into Kapharnaum; and he was teaching immediately on the sabbaths in
  the synagogues. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they were
  wondering at his teaching: for he was teaching them as having his authority,
  and not as the scribes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  immediately there was (imperf.) a man in the synagogue, being with (lit. in)
  an unclean spirit; and he cried out, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  saying: What (hast) thou with us, Jesus the Nazarene? camest thou to destroy
  us? We know thee who thou (art), the Holy (One) of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silenced, and
  come out of him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the unclean
  spirit convulsed him, and cried out with a great cry, he came from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they all feared, so that they
  sought with one another, saying: What is this? it is a new teaching; because
  with authority he commandeth the unclean spirits, they obey him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And his fame spread abroad in all the
  region of Galilee round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  immediately having come from the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon
  and Andrew, James and John being with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Now (the) mother-in-law of Simon was lying (lit.
  sleeping) sick-of-a-fever; and immediately they told him concerning her:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and he came, he raised her up, having
  taken hold of her hand; and the fever left her, and she was ministering to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And evening having come, when
  (the) sun set, they brought to him every one who was afflicted, and them with
  whom were the demons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the whole
  city assembled at the door. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he
  healed many who were afflicted in many kinds of sickness, and cast out many
  demons; and he was not permitting the demons to speak, because they were
  [not] knowing him that he was (lit. is) Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And having risen in the morning very early, he
  came forth to a desert place, and was praying there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Simon and they who were with him ran after
  him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and having found him, they said
  to him: They all seek for thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  he said to them: Let us go to another place, to the towns which are near to
  us, that we may preach there also; for I came to this thing.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he came to preach in their synagogues in all
  Galilee, and (is) casting (out) the demons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And a leper came to him, beseeching him, and
  throwing himself upon his knees, saying If thou wishest, it is possible for
  thee to cleanse me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he had
  compassion upon him, he stretched out his hand, he touched him, and said to
  him: I wish, be cleansed.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And
  immediately the leprosy went from him, and he was cleansed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And having sternly-charged him, immediately he
  sent him away, <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and said to him: Take
  heed, shew (it) not to any one: but go shew thyself to the priest, and offer
  the gift for thy cleansing which Moses commanded, for a witness to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> But he having come forth, began to
  publish (it) much, and to spread abroad his word, so that (Jesus) could not
  come into a city openly, but was (imperf.) in desert roads: and they were
  coming to him from all places.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he came again into Kapharnaum
  after some days. They heard that he is within a house: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and many assembled thither, so that the house no
  longer held (them), not even at the door: and he spake to them the word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they brought to him one,
  paralysed, four men carrying him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  having not been able, to bring him in because of the multitude, they went
  upon (the) housetop, they uncovered the roof of the house in which he was
  (imperf.): and having broken (it) up, they let down the bed on which the
  paralysed lay (lit. slept). <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Jesus,
  having seen their faith, said to the paralysed: My son, thy sins are forgiven
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But there were some of the
  scribes there sitting, and they were reasoning in their heart: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wherefore doth this (man) thus blaspheme? For whom
  is it possible to forgive sin except the one alone--God?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And immediately Jesus knew in his spirit, that
  they reason thus within themselves, he said to them: 'Wherefore reason ye
  these (things) in your hearts? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What is
  easy to say to the paralysed: "Thy sins are forgiven thee," or to say: "Rise,
  take up thy bed, and go?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> That ye may
  know that (the) Son of (the) man hath (the) authority upon the earth to
  forgive sin--he said to the paralysed <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  to thee I say: "Rise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And immediately he rose, he took up his bed, and
  came out before every one, so that they all wondered, and glorified God,
  saying: 'We never saw it (lit. being) thus.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he came forth to (the) sea; and all the
  multitude was coming to him, and he was teaching them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And passing by he saw Levi (the son) of Alpheus
  sitting at the custom-house, and he said to him: Walk after me.' And he rose,
  he walked after him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to
  pass, (as he is) sitting-at-meat in his house, (that) there were many
  publicans and sinners, they were sitting-at-meat with Jesus and his
  disciples, there were many. And the scribes and the Pharisees were walking
  after him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and having seen that he
  eateth with the publicans and the sinners, they were saying to his disciples:
  Wherefore doth your teacher eat and drink with the publicans and the sinners?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jesus having heard, said to them
  They who are strong have not need of the physician, but they who are
  diseased: for I came not to invite the righteous, but the sinners.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the disciples of John and those
  of the Pharisees were fasting: and they came, they said to him: Wherefore
  (do) the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, but thine fast
  not?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to
  them: Is it possible to make (the) sons of the bridegroom fast, while the
  bridegroom is with them? All (the) time that the bridegroom is with them, it
  is not possible for them to fast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But
  days come when the bridegroom should be taken away from them, then they will
  fast in those days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For no one
  putteth (lit. throweth) a piece of new cloth to an old garment: otherwise the
  new taketh away the filling-up of the old, and a rent becometh worse.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they do not put (lit. throw) new
  wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine rendeth the bottles, and the wine
  perisheth, and the bottles: but they put new wine into new bottles.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And it came to pass (that) he walked
  on the sabbaths through the cornfields; and his disciples began, (while)
  walking, to pluck ears-of-corn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  the Pharisees were saying to him: 'See, what do they on the sabbaths? it is
  not lawful to do it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he was
  saying to them: 'Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was
  hungry, and they who were with him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  How he went into the house of God, in time of Abiathar the chief priest, and
  ate the shewhread, which it was not lawful for him to cat except (for) the
  priests alone, and gave to them also who were (imperf) with him there.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he said to them: The sabbath was
  made because of the man, and not the man because of the sabbath <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> so that the Lord of the sabbath is (the) Son of
  (the) man.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he came again into their
  synagogue; and there was a man there whose hand was (lit. is) withered.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they were observing him, whether
  he will heal him on the sabbaths; that they might accuse him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said to the man whose hand was (lit. is)
  withered: Rise in (the) midst.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he
  said to them: 'Is it lawful to do good on the sabbaths, or to do evil? to
  save life (lit. a soul) or to kill?' But they held their peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having looked upon them with indignation,
  being grieved at the hardness of their heart, he said to the man: I Stretch
  out thy hand.' And having stretched it out, his hand was cured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the chief priests having come out immediately,
  took counsel with the Herodians against him, that they might destroy him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jesus and his disciples withdrew
  to (the) mountain: and a great multitude of Galilee, and Judea, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and Jerusalem, and Idumæa, and beyond the Jordan,
  and a great multitude also from them of Tyre and Sidon, hearing the things
  which he was doing, came to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  he said to his disciples, that a ship might wait on him because of the
  multitude, that they might not throng him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for he was healing many; so that all with whom
  were plagues came upon him and touched him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and the unclean spirits, if they see him, throw
  themselves down before him, and were crying out, saying: 'Thou art (the) Son
  of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he was charging them
  much, that they should not make him known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he went up on the mountain, and called whom
  he himself was wishing: and they went to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he appointed twelve, whom he named 'the
  Apostles,' that they might stay with him, and that he might send them to
  preach, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and to have (the) authority
  to cast out the demons: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and he gave a
  name to Simon: Peter;' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and James
  (the) son of Zebedee, and John (the) brother of James; and he gave names to
  them: Boanêrges; which is this: the sons of the thunder:' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Andrew, and Philip; Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
  Thomas, and James (the son) of Alphæus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Kananeos,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and Judas (the) Iscariot, who
  delivered him (up). <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he came into
  a house. And the multitude assembled again, so that they could not even eat
  bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And his (friends) having
  heard, came forth to lay hold on him: for they were saying, that he was mad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the scribes who came from
  Jerusalem were saying, that Belzebul is with him, and that by (lit. in the)
  ruler of the demons he cast out the demons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he called them, he was saying to them in
  parables: How is it possible that Satan cast out Satan? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, it is
  not possible that that kingdom stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And if a house be divided against itself, it is not possible that that house
  stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And if Satan rose upon
  himself, and was divided, it is not possible for him to stand, but he hath an
  end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But it is not possible that any
  one enter (the) house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he bind
  the strong man first; and then spoil his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Verily I say to you, that all things shall be
  forgiven the sons of [the] men, the sins and all the blasphemies which they
  will blaspheme: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> but he who will
  blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness for ever, but is in
  danger of eternal sin:' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> because they
  were saying, that there is an unclean spirit with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And his mother and his brothers came; and they
  stood outside, and they sent to him, calling him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the multitude was sitting around him; and
  they said to him: Lo, thy mother and thy brothers outside (are) seeking for
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And having answered them, he
  said: 'Lo, my mother and my brothers!' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And having looked upon them who sat around him,
  he said: 'Lo, my mother and my brothers! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> He who will do the will of God, this is my
  brother, and my sister, and my mother.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And again he began to teach by
  (the) sea. And a great multitude assembled to him, so that he entered into
  the ship, and sat in (the) sea by (lit. on) the shore. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he was teaching them many (things) in
  parables, and he was saying to them in his teaching: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Hear: lo, he who soweth came: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and it came to pass in his sowing, that (lit. and)
  one indeed fell by the road, and the birds came, they ate it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And another fell upon the rocky place, where there
  is not much earth; and immediately it grew up, because that it had not depth
  of earth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and when (the) sun sprang
  up, it was scorched; and because that it had not root it withered.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And another fell upon the thorns, and
  the thorns having come up, choked it, and it yielded not fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And others fell on good earth, and yielded fruit,
  coming up, it flourished; and one brought (forth) thirty, another sixty,
  another a hundred.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he was saying:
  He who hath an ear to hear, let him hear.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And having become alone, they who were around him
  were beseeching him, with the twelve, concerning the parables. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he was saying to them: 'To you are given the
  mysteries of the kingdom of God: but (as for) them who are outside, all is
  done to them in parables: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that seeing
  they may see, and not perceive (lit. see); and hearing they may hear, and not
  understand; lest haply they should return and be forgiven.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to them: 'Do ye not know this
  parable? and how will ye know all other parables? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He who sowed, sowed the word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And these are they who are by the road, the place
  in which the word was sown; and if they hear, then immediately Satan cometh,
  and taketh away the word which was sown in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And these, again thus, are they who were sown
  upon the rocky places, who, if they should hear the word, receive it with
  joy; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and there is not root in them,
  but they are (only) for a time; then, if there should be tribulation or
  persecution because of the word, immediately they are offended. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And others are they who were sown upon the
  thorns; these are they who heard the word, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and the care of this age, and the deceit of [the]
  riches, and the lusts of the rest of (things) also, in which they walk (lit.
  walking in them), choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they also who were sown upon the good earth,
  (are) they who, if they should hear the word, receive it to them, and they
  yield fruit, one thirty, one sixty, one a hundred.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he was saying to them: Do they light a lamp,
  that they may put it under the measurer, or under the bed, (and) not that
  they may put it upon the lampstand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  For there is not that which is hidden (so that) it should not appear; nor is
  it done, being hidden, except that it may come to be (lit. being) manifested.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He who hath an ear to hear, let him
  hear.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And be was saying to them
  again: 'Take heed, what ye hear: in the measure which ye measure, it will be
  measured to you: and it will be added to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For to him who hath shall be given: and from him
  who hath not, even that which he hath they take away.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he was saying: 'Thus is the kingdom of God,
  as a man casting his seed upon the earth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and he sleepeth, and he riseth in the night and
  the day, and the seed flourisheth and increaseth, he knoweth not how.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The earth of itself yieldeth fruit;
  first a blade, then an ear, then that which is in the ear fills <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But if the fruit should reach (Matthewurity),
  immediately he sendeth the sickle, because the harvest came.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he was saying: 'To what are we to liken the
  kingdom of God? or in what parable are we to set it (forth)? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> It was as a grain of mustard seed, which if it
  should be sown on the earth, being less than all the seeds which are upon the
  earth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> yet (lit. and) if it is sown,
  it cometh up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and maketh great
  branches; so that the birds of (the) heaven can lodge under its shadow.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he was speaking to them the word
  in parables thus, according as they were able to hear: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and without parable he was not speaking to them:
  but apart he was explaining all to his disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he said to them on that day, evening having
  come: Let us pass across.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And having
  left the multitude, they took him away with them, as he is in the ship. And
  there were other ships with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And
  there was a great wind, and the waves were casting themselves into the ship,
  so that the ship was now filling. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  he was sleeping behind upon the pillow: and they woke him, and said to him:
  Teacher, carest thou not that we shall (lit. will) perish?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having risen, he rebuked the wind, and said
  to (the) sea: 'Hold thy peace and be silenced.' And the wind ceased, and
  there was a great calm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And he said
  to them: Wherefore fear ye? is there not yet faith in you?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And they feared with a great fear, and were
  saying to one another: Who then is this, because the winds and (the) sea obey
  him? '</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he came across (the) sea to
  (the) country of the Gergesenes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  having come out of the ship, immediately there came to meet him out of the
  sepulchres a man with (lit. being in) an unclean spirit, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> whose dwelling was (imperf.) in the sepulchres:
  and neither even in the chains is it possible for any one to bind him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> because that he had been bound many
  times with fetters and chains, and he had burst the chains from him, and the
  fetters had been broken-inpieces: and it was not possible that any one should
  tame him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And always in the night and
  the day, he (is) being in the sepulchres, and he was (imperf.) in the
  mountains crying out, and cutting himself with stones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And having seen Jesus from afar off, he ran, and
  worshipped him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and having cried out
  with a great voice, [and] he said: 'What (hast) thou with me, thou Jesus
  (the) Son of God, who is high? I adjure thee by God, torture me not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For he was saying: Come out, unclean
  spirit, from (lit. in) the man.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  he was asking him: What is thy name?'And he said to him: 'Legion is my name,
  because we are many.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he was
  beseeching him much, that he should not send him outside of the country.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Now there was a great herd of swine
  there feeding by the mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  they were beseeching him, saying: Send us to the swine that we may enter
  them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he commanded them (to do
  so). And the unclean spirits having come out, went into the swine: and the
  herd fell down by the precipice into (the) sea, being two thousand; and they
  were choked in the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they who
  were feeding them fled, and told it in the city, and in (the) field. And they
  came to see what it is, which was done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they came to Jesus, they saw him, with whom
  were (imperf.) the demons, sitting, clothed, and having (lit. being) his mind
  (lit. heart) in him: and they feared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And they who saw (it) spake before them, how it was done to him, with whom
  were (imperf.) the demons, and concerning the swine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they began to beseech him, that he should go
  from their borders. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he entered
  into the ship. He who had been (possessed) with demons was beseeching him
  that he might stay with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he
  permitted him not, but said to him: 'Go into thy house to them who are thine,
  and shew to them the things, which the Lord did for thee, having pitied
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he departed, and began to
  publish in (the) Decapolis that which Jesus did for him: and they all were
  wondering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jesus having come
  again across in the ship, a great multitude assembled to him: and he was
  (iinperf.) by (the) sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And there
  came to him one of the rulers-of-the-synagogue, whose name is Jairus; and
  having seen him, he threw himself before his feet, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and was beseeching him much, saying My daughter
  approached to (the) death: (I pray thee) that thou come and lay thy hand upon
  her, that she may be saved, and may live.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he went with him; and a great multitude
  walked after him, and they were thronging him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And lo, a woman--she had been twelve years having
  an issue of blood, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and she suffered
  much from many physicians, and spent all which she had, and gained not
  anything, but rather became worse, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  and having heard concerning Jesus, she came in the multitude behind, she
  touched his garment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For she was
  saying: If I should but touch his garments, I shall (lit. will) be saved.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And immediately the fountain of her
  blood was dried; and she knew in her body that she was cured from the plague.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And immediately Jesus knew in himself
  the power which came out of him; having turned himself in the multitude, he
  was saying: Who touched my garments?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  And his disciples were saying to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging
  thee, and thou sayest: "Who touched me?"' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he was looking to see her who did this
  (thing). <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But the woman having feared,
  [and] trembled, knowing what was done to her, came and threw herself down
  before him, and told all the truth to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he said to her: My daughter, thy faith saved
  thee; go in peace, and be (it) for a curing from thy plague.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> (As he is) yet speaking, they came to the
  ruler-of-the-synagogue, saying: Thy daughter died: wherefore (art thou)
  troubling the Teacher?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But Jesus
  having heard the word which they say, said to the ruler-of-the-synagogue:
  'Fear not, only believe.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he
  permitted not any one with him, walking after him, except Peter, and James,
  and John (the) brother of James. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  they came to (the) house of the ruler-of-the-synagogue; and they saw them
  making-atumult, and weeping and lamenting much. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having entered, he said to them: 'Wherefore
  make-ye-a-tumult, and weep? the child died not, but she slept.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they were mocking him. But he, having put
  (lit. thrown) all out, took away with him (the) father of the child and her
  mother and them who were with him, and went into the place in which the child
  was (imperf.). <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And having laid hold
  on (the) hand of the child, he said to her: Talitha which is this: Child, I
  said to thee, rise.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And immediately
  the child rose, and walked; for she was (imperf.) [in] twelve years (old).
  And they were wondering immediately with great wonder. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And he ordered them much that no one should know
  this: and he said that they should give (lit. give eat) to her to eat.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having come from there, he came
  into his city; and his disciples walked after him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the (lit. a) sabbath having come, he began to
  teach in the synagogue: and many heard; they were wondering, saying: 'Whence
  (lit. where) found this (man) these (things)? and what is this wisdom which
  was given to this (man); and these mighty-works also of this kind which are
  done by his bands? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Is not this the
  carpenter, (the) son of Mary, and (the) brother of James, and Josetos, and
  Judas, and Simon? and his sisters were (imperf.) here with us.' And they were
  (imperf.) offended in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus
  was saying to them: 'There is not a prophet despised except in his city, and
  his kindred, and his house.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he
  could not there do even one mighty work, except having laid hand on many sick
  folk he healed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he wondered
  because of their unbelief. And he passed through the villages which were
  around, teaching. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he called the
  twelve, and began to send them, two-and-two; and he gave authority to them
  over the unclean spirits; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and he
  ordered them not to take away anything with them on (the) road, except a
  staff only; neither bread, nor scrip, nor brass in your girdles; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but your feet being shod with sandals: and clothe
  not yourselves with two coats. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he
  was saying to them: The place in which ye will enter a house, abide there
  until ye come from there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And every
  place which will not receive you to it, nor hear you, (as ye are) coming from
  there, shake off (the) dust which is underneath your feet for a witness to
  them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And having come out they
  preached that they should repent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  they cast out many demons. They were anointing with oil many sick folk, and
  were healing them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And (the) king
  Herod heard, for his name manifested itself; and he was saying, that John the
  Baptist rose from the dead, therefore the powers work in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But others were saying, that (it) is Elias. And
  others were saying, that (it is) a prophet, as one of the prophets
  of-old-time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But Herod having heard,
  was saying: '(It is) John, whom I beheaded; he rose (again).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him in
  the prison because of Herodias, (the) wife of Philip his brother, because he
  was taking her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For John was saying
  to Herod: 'It is not lawful for thee to take (the) wife of thy brother.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Herodias was (imperf.) indignant
  against him, and was wishing to kill him; and she was not able; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> for Herod feared John, knowing him that he is a
  righteous man, and is holy, and he was guarding him. And he was hearing much
  from him, and he was (import') doubtful; and gladly he was hearing him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And a convenient day having come,
  when Herod on his birthday made a supper to his great (men), and the
  chiliarchs, and the first (men) of Galilee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And (the) daughter of Herodias having come in,
  and having danced, was pleasing to Herod and them who sat at meat with him;
  and (the) king said to the damsel: Ask me for that which thou wishest, and I
  give it to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he sware to
  her: That for which thou wilt ask, I will give to thee, unto (the) half of my
  kingdom.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having come out, she
  said to her mother: For what shall (lit. will) I ask?' And she said: (The)
  head of John the Baptist.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And having
  come in with haste to (the) king, she asked, saying: wish that now thou give
  to me (the) head of John the Baptist on a dish.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And (the) heart of (the) king having been pained,
  because of the oaths, and them who sat at meat with him, he wished not to
  reject her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And immediately (the)
  king sent a soldier-of-his-guard. He commanded that he should bring his head
  on the dish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he gave it to the
  damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And his disciples having heard, came: they took
  away the body, and laid it within a sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the apostles assembled to Jesus; and they
  shewed him everything which they did, and that which they taught.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said to them: 'Come ye apart
  to a desert place, and rest yourselves for a little.' For they who came and
  they who went were (imperf.) many, and they were not finding leisure even to
  eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they went in the ship to a
  desert place apart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they saw them
  departing, and many knew them, and they ran there on foot from every city,
  and came before them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And having come
  out he saw a great multitude, and he had compassion upon them, because they
  were (imperf.) as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them
  much. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And now a late (lit. great)
  hour having come: his disciples having come to him were saying: The place is
  a desert, and now the hour (has) passed: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> send them away that they may go to the fields
  which are around, and the villages, and buy for them that which they will
  eat.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But he answered, he said to
  them: Give ye to them: let them eat.' And they said to him: Shall (]it. will)
  we go and buy two hundred staters-worth of bread, and give to them to eat?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he said to them: How many loaves
  have ye? Go, see.' And having known they said: Five loaves and two fishes.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he commanded them that they
  should sit clown to meat by companies upon the green grass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they all sat down to meat in ranks (lit. of
  place place), by hundreds and by fifties. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And having taken the five loaves and the two
  fishes, he looked to (the) heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and
  gave to the disciples, that they might set before them; and the two fishes
  also he brake among them all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And
  they all ate, and were satisfied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And
  they took up twelve baskets of fragments full, and from the fishes also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And they who were eating the loaves
  were (imperf.) five thousand men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And
  immediately he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship, and go (lit.
  draw) before him across to Bethsaida, until he sent away the multitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And having taken leave of them, he
  went to the mountain to pray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And
  evening having come, the ship was (imperf.) in (the) midst of (the) sea, and
  he alone was (imperf.) on the shore. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span>
  And he saw (or having seen) them distressed in (the) rowing (lit, drawing),
  for the wind was (imperf.) contrary to them. And in the fourth watch of the
  night he came to them, walking upon (the) sea; and he was wishing to pass by
  them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> but they, having seen him
  walking upon (the) sea, were thinking that it was (lit. is) an apparition,
  and they cried out: <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> for they had all
  seen him, and were troubled. But he immediately spake to them, and said to
  them: Be of good cheer: it is I; fear not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And he entered into the ship to them: and the
  wind ceased: and they were (imperf.) amazed greatly in themselves;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> for they understood not about the
  loaves, but their heart was (imperf.) hardened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And having crossed over, they came to
  Gennesareth, and moored (the ship). <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span>
  And having come up from the ship, (the people) knew him immediately.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> They ran, in all that region, and
  began to carry them who were afflicted, on beds, to where they hear that he
  is. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And the place into which he
  goeth, into the villages, or the cities, or the fields, (there) they were
  laying them who were sick in the market places, and they were beseeching him
  that they might but touch the hem of his garments; and all who touch him are
  cured.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And there assembled to him the
  Pharisees, and some of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and having seen some of his disciples that they
  eat bread (lit. the loaves), their hands being polluted, which is this:
  unwashen <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the Pharisees, and all
  the Jews, eat not, unless they washed (their hands) many times; holding the
  tradition of the elders: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and if they
  should not bathe themselves, (when they come) from the market place, they eat
  not. And there were many other (things) which they received, (and) which they
  held; washings (lit. bathings) of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Pharisees and the scribes
  asked him: Wherefore walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the
  elders, but with hands polluted they eat [the] bread?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to them: Well prophesied concerning
  you Isaiah, (ye) of the hypocrites, as it is written: "This people honoureth
  me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> worshipping me in vain, teaching (as) teachings
  precepts of man." <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Having left the
  commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of [the] men.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he was saying to them: Well ye reject the
  commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For Moses said: "Honour thy father and thy
  mother; and he who will speak evil at his father and his mother, let him die
  the (lit. a) death." <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But ye say, that
  if a man should say to his father and his mother, "Corban,--which is a
  gift,--if thou shouldest gain it from me;" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> ye permit not him to do anything for his father
  or his mother; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> making void the word
  of God by (lit. in) your tradition, which ye delivered: and many (things) of
  this kind like these ye do.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  having called again the multitude, he said to them: Hear me and understand:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> there is not anything outside of the
  man [for] which, going into the mouth, can (lit. it is possible to) defile
  him: but the things which come from the mouth of the man (defile him).'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Omitted <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And when they came into the house from the
  multitude, his disciples were asking him of the parable. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to them: Are ye thus without
  understanding? Understood ye not, that all things which are outside, going
  into the mouth of the man--it is not possible for them to defile him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> because they go not into his heart,
  but his belly, and go to the draught?' (This he said,) cleansing all meats.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he was saying: That which cometh
  from the mouth of the man, that (lit. he) defileth the man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For from within, out of the heart of the men,
  come out the evil reasonings, the fornications, the thefts, the murders, the
  adulteries, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> the violences, the
  wickednesses, the deceits, the defilements, the evil eyes, the blasphemies,
  pride, foolishness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> all these evil
  things (are) coming from within, and they defile the man.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having risen from there, he went to the parts
  of Tyre and Sidon; and having gone into a house, he was not wishing that any
  should know (it): and he could not be hid (lit. be forgotten). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And immediately a woman heard concerning him,
  (one,) with whose daughter was an unclean spirit. Having come in, she threw
  herself down at his feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Now the
  woman was Greek of Syria, her race is from Phoenice. And she was beseeching
  him that he would cast a demon out of her daughter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he was saying to her: 'Permit it first, that
  the sons should be satisfied: for it is not good to take away (the) bread of
  the sons to give it to the dogs.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But
  she answered, she said to him: Yea, my Lord: even the dogs eat under the
  table of the crumbs of the children.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And he said to her: Because of this word go (away); the demon went from thy
  daughter.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And having gone to her
  house, she found the child upon the bed, and the demon went from her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And having come again from the
  borders of Tyre, he was passing through Sidon to (the) sea of Galilee,
  between the borders of Decapolis. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  they brought to him a deaf-dumb (man); and besought him that he would lay
  hand upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he took him away
  apart from the multitude; he put (lit. threw) his fingers into his ears, and
  having spit, he touched his tongue; <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  and having looked up to (the) heaven, he sighed, and said to him: Epphatha,'
  which is this: 'Open.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And his ears
  opened, and the bond of his tongue unloosed, and he was speaking plain (lit.
  straight). <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he ordered them that
  they should not tell it to any one: but as (he commanded), rather they were
  publishing (it) the more: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> they were
  wondering, saying: He did all well, having made the deaf hear, and the
  speechless speak.'</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In those days again a great
  multitude being with him, and there is not that which they will eat, he
  called the disciples, he said to them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  I have compassion upon this multitude, because lo, three days they stay with
  me, and there is not that which they will eat: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and if I should send them away to their house
  without eating, they will faint on the road; and some also of them were
  (imperf.) from far. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the disciples
  answered him: For whom (and) whence here is it possible to satisfy these with
  bread on (the) desert?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he was
  asking them: How many loaves have ye?' And they said: Seven.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he ordered the multitude that they should sit
  down to meat upon the ground: and having taken the seven loaves, he gave
  thanks, he brake them, and gave to his disciples that they should set (them)
  before them: and they set (them) before the multitude. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they had also a few fishes: and he blessed
  them, he told them to set these also before them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up
  the abundance (plur.) of the fragments seven baskets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They were (imperf.) four thousand: and he sent
  them away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And immediately he entered
  into the ship, he came to the parts of Dalmanutha. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Pharisees came forth, they began to
  question with him, seeking for a sign from him from (the) heaven, tempting
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And having sighed in his spirit,
  he said: 'Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you: Will
  a sign be given to this generation?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And having sent them away, he entered into (a ship), he went across.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they forgot to take bread; and
  they had not any on the ship except one (lit. a) loaf only. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he was ordering them, saying: Take heed and
  beware of (the) leaven of the Pharisees, and (the) leaven of Herod.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they were reasoning with one
  another, saying that they have not bread. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having known, he said to them: 'Why reason
  ye, because ye have not bread? Know ye not yet, and do ye not understand? Is
  your heart hardened? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And ye have
  eyes, see ye not? and ye have ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> the five loaves which I brake for the
  five thousand, (and) that ye took up how many baskets full?' They said to
  him: Twelve.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the seven for the
  four thousand, (and) that ye took up how many baskets full?' They said to
  him: Seven.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he was saying to
  them: 'How (is it that) ye understand not?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to
  him a blind man, and they were beseeching him that he should touch him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he took hold of (the) hand of the
  blind man, and brought him outside of the village; and having spit in his
  eyes, he laid his hand upon him; he was asking: 'What seest thou?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having seen, he was saying: I see
  the men as trees, walking.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then
  again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he saw, and he was cured, he saw
  everything clearly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he sent him
  to his house, saying: Go not into the village.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Jesus came forth, and his disciples, to the
  villages of Caesarea Philippi: and in the road he was asking his disciples,
  saying to them: Whom said [the] men that I (am)'?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> They told him, saying: John the Baptist; and
  others: "Elias;" others: "One of the prophets."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he was asking them: But whom say ye that I
  (am)?' Peter answered and said: 'Thou art Christ.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he charged them that they should not say to
  any one concerning him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he began
  to teach them, that (the) Son of (the) man must suffer much, and be rejected
  by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and
  after three days rise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he was
  speaking the word openly. And Peter laid hold on him, he began to rebuke him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But he having turned himself, and
  having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said: Go behind me, Satan:
  because thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of [the] men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And having called the multitude and
  his disciples, he said to them: He who wisheth to come after me, let him deny
  himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> For he who will wish to save his life (lit. soul,
  thus again) shall lose it; and he who will lose his life because of me and
  because of the gospel, shall save it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  For what will the man gain, if he should gain the whole world, and forfeit
  his life? <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For (what is) that which
  the man will give in exchange for his life? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> For he who will be ashamed to confess me and my
  words in this generation adulterous and sinful, (the) Son of (the) man also
  will be ashamed of him, when he should come in (the) glory of his Father and
  his holy angels.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he was saying to them: Verily I
  say to you, that there are some among them who stand here, (who) will not
  taste of (the) death, until they see the kingdom of God come (lit. it came,
  or coming) with power.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And after six
  days Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, and took them away upon a high
  mountain apart alone. He changed himself before them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his garments became glistering as snow, and
  very white; as (lit. they which) it is not possible that a fuller who is upon
  the earth should make thus white. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  Elias and Moses manifested themselves to them: and they were speaking to
  Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And then Peter, having
  answered, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us that we be here, and make
  three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For he was not knowing what he will
  answer him; for they became full of fear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there was a cloud shadowing them: and there
  was a voice out of the cloud: This is my Son, my beloved: hearken to him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And having looked suddenly, they saw
  not any one, except Jesus alone with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And (as they are) coming down from the mountain,
  he ordered them that they should not speak before any one that which they
  saw, except (the) Son of (the) man rise from the dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they held the word among them, questioning
  with one another: What is the rising from the dead?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they asked him, saying Wherefore say the
  scribes that it is necessary that Elias come first?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said to them: Elias indeed cometh first,
  and will restore everything: and how (it is) written about (the) Son of (the)
  man, that he should suffer much, and should be despised. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But I say to you, that Elias came, and they did
  to him that which they wish, according as it is written about him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And having come to the disciples, he
  saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And immediately all the multitude,
  having seen him, feared, and having run, saluted him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he asked them:: For what sought ye from
  them?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And one from the multitude
  answered him: Teacher, I brought my son to thee, a speechless spirit being
  with him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and where it will catch
  him, it dasheth (lit. bringeth) him down: and his mouth foameth, (he is)
  grinding his teeth, and pineth away: and I told thy disciples that they might
  cast it out; and they could not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  he having answered, said to them: 'O [the] faithless generation, how long
  shall (lit. will) I be with you? how long shall (lit. will) I bear with you?
  bring him to me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the spirit
  having seen him, immediately convulsed him; and having fallen upon (the)
  earth, he was trembling, his mouth foaming. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And A d he asked his father: Lo, how much time
  (is it) since this happened to him?' And he said: From his childhood.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And many times it casteth him into
  the fire and the water, that it may destroy him: but as to that which is
  possible for thee help us, having compassion upon us.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus said to him: 'What, then, is (this,
  namely) as to that which is possible for thee? It is possible as to
  everything for him who believeth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Immediately cried out (the) father of the child, saying: I believe; help my
  unbelief.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Jesus having seen that the
  multitude ran (up), rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him: 'Speechless
  and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and no more enter him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And having cried out, and having
  convulsed him much, he came out; and he was as one dead; so that many said:
  He died.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But Jesus took hold of his
  hand, raised him, and he rose. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he
  went into his house. His disciples asked him apart: Wherefore could not we
  cast him out?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he said to them:
  It is not possible that this kind should come out with anything, except with
  prayer and fasting.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And having come
  from there, they were passing through Galilee; and he wished not that any one
  should know. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For he was teaching his
  disciples, and was saying to them: (The) Son of (the) man will be given into
  (the) hands of [the] men, and they will kill him; after three days he will
  rise.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But they were (imperf)
  ignorant of the word, and were fearing to ask him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he came into Kapharnaum: and having come into
  the house, he was asking them: What were ye reasoning [them] on (the) road? '
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But they held their peace: for they
  were speaking to one another on (the) road, who of them is the great.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And having sat down, he called the
  twelve; and said to them: 'He who wisheth to be first, shall be last of every
  one, and minister of every one.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And
  having taken a child, he made him stand in their midst; and having taken hold
  of him, he said to them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> He who will
  receive one of these children of this kind in my name, receiveth me: and he
  who receiveth me, receiveth not me, but he received him who sent me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> John said to him: Teacher, we saw one
  casting out demons in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followeth us
  not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But Jesus said to him: Forbid
  him not: for there is not any one, who will do a mighty work in my name, and
  could quickly speak evil against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span>
  For he who is not against us, was for us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> For he who will give you a cup of water to drink
  in my name, because ye belong to Christ; verily I say to you, that his reward
  shall not perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he who will
  offend one of these little ones who believe, it is good for him, rather to
  hang a millstone to him, and to be cast into (the) sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is
  good for thee that thou come into the life being maimed, than with two hands
  that thou go to the Geenna, to the unquenchable fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Omitted <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  And if thy foot offend thee, cut it (off), cast it away: it is good for thee
  that thou come into the life being lame, than having two feet that thou be
  cast to the Geenna. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Omitted
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck
  it out: it is good for thee that thou come into the kingdom of God with only
  thy (one) eye, than having two eyes that thou be cast to the Geenna,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> where their worm dieth not., and
  their fire is not quenched. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Every one
  they salt with the fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> [The] salt
  is good: but if the salt become saltless, with (lit. in) what do they salt
  it? Let there be salt in you, and be at peace with (lit. in) one
  another.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having risen from there, he
  came to the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes came again
  to him, and as it was (lit. is) his custom, he was teaching them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Pharisees came to him; they were
  asking him, whether it is lawful for (a) man to put away his wife, tempting
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he answered, he said to them:
  What did Moses order for (lit. on) you?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they said to him: Moses commanded to write a
  bill (lit. book of writing) of divorcement, and to put away.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Jesus said to them: Because of your hardness
  of heart he wrote this commandment for you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But from (the) beginning of the creation, a male
  and female he created them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore
  the man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall join himself to his
  wife; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and they (the) two shall become
  one flesh: so that they are not two, but it is one flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> That then which God joined, let not (the) man
  separate.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And in the house again the
  disciples asked him concerning this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And he said to them: He who will put away his wife, and take another,
  committeth adultery against her: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and
  if she herself put away her husband, and take another, she committeth
  adultery.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they brought to him
  children, that he might touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Jesus having seen (it), was
  grieved, and said to them: Permit the children to come to me; forbid them not
  to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Verily I say to you, that he who will not receive
  the kingdom of God to him as a child, shall not come into it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And having embraced them, he blessed them, he
  laid hand upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And (as he is)
  coming forth to a road, one ran (up), he threw himself upon his knees, he was
  asking him: 'Good Teacher, what shall (lit. will) I do that I may inherit
  eternal life?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jesus said to him:
  Wherefore sayest thou of me: "The good?" there is not any one good except God
  alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou knowest the commandments;
  kill not; commit not adultery; steal not; bear not false witness; defraud no;
  honour thy father and thy mother.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  And he said to him: Teacher, all these I kept from my childhood.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jesus having looked upon him,
  loved him, and said to him: Another thing thou lackest: go, sell that which
  thou hast, give it (lit. them) to the poor, and thou shalt get for thee a
  treasure in (the) heaven: and come, follow me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But he having been saddened at the word, went
  (away), being grieved: for he was having many possessions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus having looked, said to his disciples:
  How difficult it is for them who have the riches to come into the kingdom of
  God!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the disciples were fearing
  at the word. But Jesus again having answered them, said: My sons, how
  difficult it is for them who trust to riches to come into the kingdom of God!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> It is easier for a camel to pass
  through (the) eye of a needle, than that a rich man come into the kingdom of
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they were wondering the
  more, saying to him: Who will be able to be saved?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Jesus having looked upon them, said: 'With [the]
  men impossible, but not for God: for all is possible for God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Peter began to say to him: Lo, we left all, and
  followed thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Jesus said: Verily I
  say, that there is not any one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or
  mother, or father, or son, or land, because of me, and because of the gospel,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> unless he should receive a
  hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers,
  and fathers, and sons, and lands, with (lit. in) the persecutions; and in the
  age which cometh, eternal life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But
  many first shall be last; and last about to be first.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they were (imperf.) on (the) road, coming up
  to Jerusalem; and Jesus was walking before them: and they were fearing; and
  they, who were following, were fearing. And again he brought the twelve
  (close) to him, he began to tell them the things which will happen to him:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Lo, we shall (lit. will) go up to
  Jerusalem; and (the) Son of (the) man will be delivered to the chief priests
  and the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and they will deliver
  him to the Gentiles: <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and they will
  mock him, and they will spit upon him, and they will scourge him, and they
  will kill him; and after three days he will rise.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And there came to him James and John, (the) two
  sons of Zebedee, saying to him: 'Teacher, we wish that that, which we shall
  (lit. will) ask, thou mayest do for us.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he said to them: What wish ye that I should
  do for you? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> They said to him: 'Give
  to us that one should sit on thy right hand, and one of us on thy left hand
  in thy glory.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But Jesus said to
  them: Ye know not what ye will ask. Is it possible for you to drink the cup
  which I drink? or (to be baptised with) the baptism, with which I baptise
  myself? <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And they said: 'It is
  possible for us.' And Jesus said to them: The cup which I drink, ye shall
  drink it; and the baptism with which I baptise myself, ye shall baptise
  yourselves with it: <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> but the sitting
  on my right hand or left hand is not mine to give: but it belongs to them for
  whom he prepared it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And the ten
  other having heard, began to murmur because of James and John. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And Jesus having called them, said to them: Ye
  know that they, who think that they are rulers of the Gentiles, are lords of
  them; and their great (ones) are in authority over them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But thus it is not among you: but he who will
  wish to be great among you shall be minister (lit. deacon) to you:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and he who will wish to be first
  among you shall be servant of every one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> For (the) Son of (the) man came not to be
  ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life (lit. soul) a ransom in
  exchange for many.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And they came to
  Jericho: and (as he is) coming out of Jericho, and his disciples and a great
  multitude, Bartimeos, (the) son of Timeos, being a blind beggar, was sitting
  by the road. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And having heard that it
  is Jesus the Nazarene, he began to say, crying out, saying: Jesus, (the) son
  of David, pity me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And many were
  rebuking him, that he should hold his peace. But he was crying out the more
  rather: (The) son of David pity me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span>
  And Jesus having stood, said: Call him.' And they called to the blind man,
  saying to him: Be of good cheer: rise, come, he calleth thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And he having cast away his garment, and having
  sprung up, came to Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Jesus
  answered him, he said: What wishest thou that I should do to thee?' The blind
  man said to him: Rabbuni, that I may see.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And Jesus said to him: Go, thy faith saved thee.'
  And immediately he saw, and was walking after him in the road.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having approached Jerusalem, he
  came to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain of the Olives; he sent two of
  his disciples, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and said to them: Go to
  this village which is in front of you: and immediately, going to enter it, ye
  shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet mounted; unloose him, and bring
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And if any one say to you: "What
  is this which ye do?" say that the Lord path need of him; and immediately he
  will send him hither.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they went,
  and found a colt tied at a door outside in (lit. of) the street; and they
  unloosed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And some of them who
  stood there were saying to them: What do ye, unloosing the colt?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they said to them, according as
  Jesus said to them: and they permitted them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they brought the colt to Jesus, and placed on
  him their garments; and he sat upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And many spread their garments on the road; and
  others cut branches of trees in the fields, and were spreading them on the
  road. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they who were walking
  before, and they who were walking behind, were crying out: Osanna; blessed is
  he who cometh in (the) name of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Blessed is the kingdom, which cometh, of our
  father David: Osanna in the highest.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And he Caine into Jerusalem, into the temple; and having gazed at all,
  evening now of time (lit. an an hour) having come, he came to Bethany with
  the twelve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And on the (lit. his)
  morrow, they having come from Bethany, he hungered. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Having seen a fig-tree afar off having (lit.
  being) leaves on it, he came (to see) whether he will find anything on it:
  and having come to it, he found not anything except leaves; for it was
  (imperf.) not (the) time of figs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  having answered, he said to it: No one shall find fruit on thee for ever.'
  And his disciples were hearing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  they came to Jerusalem: and having come into the temple, he began to cast out
  all them who sold and them who bought in the temple, and the tables of the
  money-changers, and the seats of them who sold doves, he overturned;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and he was not permitting any one to
  (lit. that he) bring a vessel through the temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he was teaching, and was saying to them: 'It
  is written, that my house shall be called "a house of prayer for all the
  nations:" but ye made it a cave of robbers.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the chief priests and the scribes having
  heard, [and] were seeking in what manner they are to destroy him: for they
  were fearing him, for all the multitude were wondering at his teaching.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if evening came, he was departing
  outside of the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And passing by
  in the morning, they saw the fig-tree; it (had) withered away to (lit. on)
  its root. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Peter having remembered
  said to him: 'Rabbi, lo, the fig-tree, which thou cursedst, withered away.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Jesus having answered said to
  them: 'Have faith in God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For verily
  I say to you, that he who will say to this mountain: "Lift thyself up and
  cast thyself into (the) sea;" and not doubt in his heart, but believe that
  what he saith will be done; it shall be done to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore I say to you, that everything which ye
  will ask in prayer, believe that ye received, and they shall be done to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And if ye should stand for praying,
  forgive that which ye have against any (lit. him); that your Father also who
  is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Omitted <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And they came again to Jerusalem: and (as he is) walking in the temple there
  came to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and they were saying to him: 'With what authority
  didst thou these things? or who gave to thee this authority, that thou doest
  these things?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Jesus said to
  them: I shall (lit, will) ask you one word; answer me; and I also shall (lit.
  will) say to you with what authority I did these things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The baptism of John, was it from (the) heaven, or
  from [the] men? answer me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they
  were reasoning with one another, saying: If we should say, that it is from
  (the) heaven, he will say, "Wherefore believed ye him not?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But should we say, that (it is) from [the] men,
  we fear the multitude; for John was (imperf.) to all of them really (lit.
  that he was really a prophet.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And
  having answered Jesus they said: We know not.' And Jesus also said to them:
  Neither shall (lit. will) I also say to you with what authority I did (these
  things).'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he began to speak to them in
  parables: There was a man; he planted a vineyard, and built a wall (lit.
  hedge) for it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower in it, and
  delivered it to husbandmen, and went to (the) foreign (land). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he sent to the husbandmen in (the) time a
  servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of (the) fruit of the
  vineyard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And having taken him they
  beat him, and sent him (away) empty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And he sent again to them another servant; and this (lit. the) other one they
  wounded and reviled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he sent
  another; and this (lit. the) other they killed. And he sent many others: some
  they stoned, and others they killed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Having (lit. who was his) yet a beloved son, he sent him at (the) end to
  them, saying: "They will reverence my son." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But those husband men were saying to one another:
  "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let the inheritance be ours."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And having taken him, they killed him,
  and cast him outside of the vineyard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  What will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the
  husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Did ye not read even this scripture, that the
  stone which the builders rejected, this was made for a completion of (the)
  corner: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> this having been done by the
  Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they were seeking to lay hold on him; and
  they feared the multitude; for they knew that he spake (lit. said) this
  parable concerning them: and having left him they went (away). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and
  the Herodians, that they might ensnare him by word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And having come, they said to him: Teacher, we
  know that thou (art) true, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not
  (the) person of men, but teachest the road of God in truth. Is it lawful to
  give tax to (the) king, or not? should (conj.) we give, or should we not give
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said
  to them: Wherefore tempt ye me? Bring me a stater, that I may see it.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they brought (it). And he said to
  them: Whose is this image and this superscription?' And they said to him:
  '(The) king's are they.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said
  to them: ('The) king's (things) give to (the) king, and God's (things) give
  to God.' And they were wondering at him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And there came to him Sadducees, who say that
  there is not (to) be resurrection; and they were asking him, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if
  (the) brother of any one die, and leave behind a wife, and leave not son,
  that his brother should take his (lit. the) wife, and raise up seed to his
  brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Now there were seven
  brothers with us: and the first took (a) wife; he died (lit. was dying), he
  left not seed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and the second took
  her, and died, he left not seed; and the third thus again: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and the seventh; they left not seed. And at (the)
  end of them all died the woman also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  In the resurrection, of which of them is she to be wife? for the seven took
  her to wife.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Jesus said to them: Do
  ye not therefore err? Ye know not the scripture, nor the power of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For when they should rise from (lit.
  in, or among) the dead, they neither take, nor are taken (to wife); but are
  as the angels in the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But
  concerning the dead, that they will rise; did ye not read in (the) book of
  Moses, how He said to him in (lit. upon) the bush, saying: "I am God of
  Abraam, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> God is not (the God) of the dead, but of the
  living: ye err greatly.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And there
  came to him one of the scribes, having heard them questioning (lit. seeking),
  knowing that he answered them well, asked him: What is the commandment which
  is first of them all?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Jesus
  answered: The first is this: Hear, Israel; the Lord thy God is one Lord:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
  from all thy heart, and from all thy soul, and from all thy thoughts, and
  from all thy power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The second is
  this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is not another
  commandment greater than these.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The
  scribe said to him: Well, Teacher, in truth thou saidst, that God is one; and
  there is no other except him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> and the
  loving him with all thy heart, and with all thy power, and with all the
  understanding; and the loving thy neighbour as thyself,--they are greater
  than all the whole-burntofferings and the sacrifices.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus having seen him, that he answered (as)
  having sense (lit. heart), said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of
  God.' And no one could dare to ask him (further). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Jesus having answered was saying, (as he is)
  teaching in the temple. How say the scribes, that Christ is (the) son of
  David? <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> David himself said in the Holy
  Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit thou on my right hand, until I put
  thine enemies below thy feet."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> David
  himself saying of him, Lord;' then (lit. and) whence is (he) his son? And the
  great multitude was hearing him gladly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And in his teaching he was saying: 'Beware of the
  scribes, and them who wish to walk in long robes, and (for) salutations in
  the market-places, <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and first sittings
  in the seats in the synagogues, and first places in the feasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> They who eat the houses of the widows, and in
  pretence prolonged they pray; these will receive more judgement.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And having sat opposite the treasury,
  he was seeing how the multitudes threw money (lit. brass) into the treasury:
  and many rich (men) were throwing many (pieces). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And a poor widow having come, threw two
  farthings, which make (lit. is) a kondrantes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And having called his disciples, he said to them:
  'Verily I say to you, that this poor widow threw (more) than all these who
  throw into the treasury: <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> for all
  threw from their superfluity; but this (one), she, from her deficiency, threw
  everything which she had, all her life.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And (as he is) coming from the
  temple, one of his disciples said to him Teacher, seest thou of what kind are
  these stones, and buildings of what kind?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jesus said to him: Seest thou these great
  stones? a stone shall not be left upon a stone here, (which) will not be
  pulled down.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And (as he is) sitting
  on the mountain of the Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John
  and Andrew asked him apart: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Say to us
  when these (things) will be? and what is the sign if all these (things)
  should be going to be fulfilled?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  Jesus began to say: Take heed, let not any one lead you astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For there are many (who) will come in my name,
  saying: "I am Christ; "and they will lead many astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And when ye should hear of wars and rumours of
  war, be not troubled: it is necessary that they happen; but the end cometh
  not yet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For nation shall rise upon
  nation, and kingdom upon kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in different
  places; there shall be famines: (a) beginning of the pangs are these.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But take ye heed to yourselves: they
  will deliver you to councils; and in the synagogues ye will be beaten; and
  made to stand before governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them
  and all the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The gospel must,
  first be preached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And if they bring
  you (to judgement), delivering you up, do not take care beforehand what ye
  will speak: but that which will be given to you in that hour, this is that
  which ye will speak: for that which will speak (is) not ye, but it is the
  Holy Spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And a brother shall
  deliver (up) a brother to (the) death, and a father shall deliver (up) a son;
  and sons will rise upon fathers, and will kill them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And ye shall become hated by all (lit. all hating
  you) because of my name: but he who will hold on until the end (lit. out),
  this is he who will be saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if
  ye see the abomination of the desolation standing where it is not lawful--he
  who readeth, let him understand--then they who are in Judea, let them flee
  upon the mountains: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> he who is upon
  (the) housetop, make him not come down, nor make him enter to take away
  anything from his house: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and he who
  is in (the) field, make him not come back to take away his garment.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But woe to them who are with child,
  and them who give suck in those days! <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And pray that not in (the) winter may be your flight. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For those days shall be tribulation; there was
  not like it from (the) beginning of the creation which God created until now,
  and there shall not be again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  unless the Lord caused those days to be few, no flesh would have been saved:
  but because of the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if one say to you: "Lo, Christ (is) here; or
  there;" believe not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For false
  Christs shall rise and false prophets, and shew (lit. give) signs and wonders
  for (the) leading astray, if they should be able, even the chosen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But ye, take heed, that I said
  everything beforehand <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But in those
  days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall
  not give his light, <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and the stars
  shall be falling from (the) heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be
  shaken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And then they shall see (the)
  Son of (the) man coming in clouds with great power and glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then he will send his angels, and will gather his
  chosen from the four winds, from the end (lit. his end) of (the) earth unto
  the end (lit. her end) of (the) heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Now from the fig-tree learn (lit. know) the
  parable: if now her branches are tender, and put (lit. throw) forth leaves,
  ye know that summer approacheth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> thus
  ye also if ye should see these things having happened, know that he
  approacheth to the doors. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Verily I
  say to you, that this generation shall not pass away, until all these things
  be accomplished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> (The) heaven and the
  earth will pass away, but my words shall not pass away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But concerning that day and the hour no one
  knoweth them, nor angel in (the) heaven, nor (the) Son, except (the) Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Look forth, watch, pray: for ye know
  not when is the time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> As a man who
  went (lit. walked) to (the) foreign (land), who left his house, and he gave
  to his servants the authority, (and to) each his work, and ordered the porter
  that he should watch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Watch then: for
  ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, either in the evening, or
  (the) midnight, or the cock crowing, or in the morning; <span style=

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now it was the passover and the
  (feast of the) unleavened after two days: and the chief priests and the
  scribes were seeking how they might lay hold on him with subtilty, and kill
  him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for they were saying: Let us not
  do it in (the) feast, lest haply there (may) be a tumult among the people.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And being in Bethany in (the) house of
  Simon the leper, sitting at meat, there came a woman having a vessel of
  ointment of nard, pistike, being of great price: having broken the vessel she
  poured (lit. having poured) it upon his head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But some were murmuring with one another, saying:
  Wherefore was this waste of this ointment made? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For it was possible to sell this (for) above three
  hundred staters, and give them to the poor.' And they were (imperf.)
  indignant against her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But Jesus said
  to them: Permit her, why trouble ye her? for a good work she worked on (lit.
  in) me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Always the poor are with you,
  and if ye wish it is possible for you to do good to them always; but I am
  with you not always. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> That which she
  received she did: for she anointed my body beforehand with this ointment for
  my embalming. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Verily I say to you,
  that (in) the place in which this gospel will be preached in the whole world,
  that also which this (woman) did shall be spoken of for a memorial to her.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Judas (the) Iscariot, the one of
  the twelve, went to the chief priests that he might deliver him to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they, having heard, rejoiced, and
  gave to him silver. And he was seeking how he will deliver him (up)
  conveniently. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And (on) the first day
  of the unleavened, when they slay the passover, his disciples said to him:
  'Whither wishest thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the
  passover?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he sent two of his
  disciples, and said to them: Go to the city, and there will meet you a man
  carrying a pitcher of water: walk after him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and (at) the place into which he will go, say to
  the owner-ofthe-house, that the Teacher said: "Where was the guest-chamber
  (lit, rest place), the place in which I shall (lit. will) eat the passover
  with my disciples?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he will show
  to you a large room (lit. place) aloft, spread, prepared: and prepare it for
  us there.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And his disciples came
  out, and came to the city, and found according as he said to them: and they
  prepared the passover. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And evening
  having come, he came with the twelve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And (as they are) sitting at meat and eating, Jesus said to them: Verily I
  say to you, that one of (lit. from) you will deliver me (up), (one) of them
  who eat with me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They began to be
  grieved, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said to them: One of the twelve, who
  dipped his hand with me in the dish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Because (the) Son of (the) man indeed will go, according as it is written
  concerning him: but woe to that man by whom (the) Son of (the) man will be
  delivered (up)! it were good for him (if) that man had not been (lit. they
  bare him not) born.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And (as they
  were) eating, Jesus having taken bread, having blessed it, brake it, and gave
  to them, and he said: Take: this is my body.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Having taken a cup, he gave thanks, he gave to
  them: and they drank of (lit. in) it, all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he said to them: This is my blood of the
  testament, which will be shed for many, for (the) forgiving of their sins.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Verily I say to you, that I shall not
  drink of (the) fruit of this vine, until that day when I should drink it new
  in the kingdom of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And having
  blessed, they came out to the mountain of the Olives. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Jesus said to them: Ye will be all offended:
  because it is written, that I shall (lit. will) smite the shepherd, and the
  sheep will be scattered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But after my
  rising, I shall (lit. will) go before you to Galilee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But Peter said to him: Even if all should be
  offended, yet not I.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jesus said
  to him: Verily I say to thee, that thou to-day, in this night, before a cock
  crow twice, wilt deny me three times.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But he was speaking excessively: Even if it
  should come about that I die with thee, I shall not deny thee.' And thus
  again were they all saying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they
  came to a garden (lit. field) the name of which is Gethsemani: and he said to
  his disciples: Sit here, while I pray.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he took away with him Peter and James and
  John, and began to be troubled, and grieved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he said to them: My soul is pained unto (the)
  death: abide here, and watch.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And
  having passed on a little, he was throwing himself down upon (the) earth, and
  was praying, that if it is possible, the hour might pass away from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he was saying: Abba, Father, it
  is possible for everything with thee; let the cup pass away from me: but not
  as I will, but as thou wilt.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he
  came, he found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: 'Simon, sleepest thou?
  Couldest thou not watch with me for an hour? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Watch then, and pray, that ye come not into
  temptation: the spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And again having gone (away) he was praying, he
  said the same word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And he came
  again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were (imperf.) heavy; and they
  were not knowing what they will answer him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he came the third time, and said to them:
  Sleep on: the hour came; lo, (the) Son of (the) man will be delivered to
  (the) hands of the sinners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Rise, let
  us go; lo, he who will deliver me (up), approached.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And immediately, (as he is) yet speaking, came
  Judas, one of the twelve, and a multitude being with him, with swords and
  staves (lit. pieces of wood), from the chief priests and the elders and the
  scribes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Because he who will deliver
  him (up) gave a sign to them, saying: He, whose mouth I shall (lit. will)
  kiss, is he; lay hold on him, and take him (away) safely.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And having come, immediately he came to him, and
  said: Rabbi;' and he kissed his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And they put forth (lit. brought) their hands
  upon him, and laid hold on him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> But
  one of them who stood (by) drew the sword, and he (lit. who) gave a blow to
  (the) servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to them: Came ye out
  as coming after a robber, with swords and staves (as above) to take (lit.
  catch) me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> I was (imperf.) with you
  daily teaching in the temple, and ye laid not hold on me. But that the
  Scriptures might be fulfilled.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And
  having left him, they all fled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And
  there was a young man walking after him, being clad with a linen cloth upon
  his naked (body): and they laid hold on him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> but he left behind the linen cloth, he fled
  naked. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And they took Jesus to the
  chief priests and the elders and the scribes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And Peter was walking after him afar off, unto
  within the court of the chief priest; and he was sitting together with the
  officers, and is warming himself at the light (of the fire). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> Now the chief priest and the whole council were
  seeking for witness against Jesus for (the) killing him; and they were not
  finding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> For many were bearing false
  witness against him, and their witness (pl.) was not agreeing together.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And some having risen bare false
  witness against him, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> We heard
  him saying: "I shall (lit. will) pull down this temple this (which is) built
  with hands, and in (lit. through) three days I shall (lit. will) build
  another not built with hands."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Not
  even thus was (imperf.) their witness (sing.) agreeing together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And the chief priest rose (up) into (the) midst,
  he asked Jesus saying: Answerest thou not anything, as to (what) these bear
  witness against thee?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> But he was
  holding his peace, and answered not anything. Again the chief priest asked
  him, and said to him:'Art thou Christ, (the) Son of him who is blessed?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And Jesus said: I am: and ye shall
  see (the) Son of (the) man sitting on (the) right hand of the power, and
  coming with the clouds of (the) heaven.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And the chief priest, having rent his garments,
  said: What need have ye of witnesses again? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Ye heard the blasphemy: what appears to you?' And
  they all condemned him, that he is guilty of (the) death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his
  face, and to buffet him, and to say to him: Prophesy to us, who beat thee
  now, Christ?' And the officers received him with blows-of-their-hands
  (doubtful word). <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And Peter being down
  in the court, there came one of the maidservants of the chief priest;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> and having seen Peter warming
  himself, and having looked upon him, said to him: Thou also wast (imperf.)
  with Jesus of Nazareth (lit. the Nazêreos).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(68)</span> But he denied, saying: 'I neither know nor
  understand (lit. know) what thou sayest.' And he came forth to the place
  which was outside of the court. <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> And,
  having seen him, the other (maid) said to them who stood (by): This is one of
  them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> But he again denied. After a
  little, again they who stood (by) were saying to Peter: Truly thou (art) one
  of them; for thou (art) a Galilaean.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(71)</span>
  But he began to curse and swear: I know this man not, of whom ye speak (lit.
  say).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(72)</span> And a cock crew (the) second
  time. And Peter remembered the word as Jesus said to him, that before a cock
  crow twice, thou wilt deny me three times. And having begun (lit. thrown his
  hand), he wept.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And immediately the chief priests
  with the elders and the scribes and the whole council took (lit. counselled)
  counsel early; they bound Jesus, they took him, they delivered him to Pilate.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Pilate asked him: Art thou (the)
  king of the Jews?' And he having answered, said to him:' 'Thou sayest.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the chief priests were accusing
  him much. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Pilate again was asking
  him, saying: Answerest thou not anything? see how much they accuse thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Jesus no longer answered anything;
  so that Pilate wondered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now at (the)
  feast he was releasing one, (who is) bound, to them, whom they ask.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he who is called Barabbas' was
  (imperf.) bound, with them who made a tumult, they who were committing murder
  in (the) tumult. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And, having come up,
  the multitude began to ask (him to do) according as he was doing to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Pilate answered them, saying: 'Do
  ye wish that I should release to you (the) king of the Jews?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For he was knowing that they delivered him (up)
  because of envy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the chief
  priests moved the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Pilate, having answered, said to
  them: What then shall (lit. will) I do to him whom ye call (lit. say to)
  "(The) king of the Jews?"' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they
  again cried out: Crucify him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For
  Pilate was saying to them: Why, what evil did he?' But they the more were
  crying out: Crucify him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Pilate,
  wishing to do the will of the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and he
  delivered Jesus to scourge him, that they might crucify him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the soldiers took him into the court of the
  Prætorium; and they called the whole band upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they clothed him with a purple garment, and
  they plaited a crown of (lit. from) thorns, they set it upon him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and they began to salute him: Hail,
  (the) king of the Jews.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they
  struck his head with a reed, and they were spitting in his face, and throwing
  themselves upon their knees to worship him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And when they (had) mocked him, they stripped him
  of the purple garment, and clothed him with his garments, and brought him
  forth that they might crucify him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And they compelled to go with (them) one passing by, Simon the Cyrenian,
  coming from (the) field, (the) father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might
  take up his cross. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they brought
  him to the place of Golgotha, this which they interpret: The place of the
  skull.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they gave to him wine
  mingled with gall: but he received it not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they crucified him, and divided his garments
  among them, having cast lot for them, as to who will take them away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And it was (the) third hour, and they
  crucified him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the superscription
  of his accusation was (imperf.) written: (The) king of the Jews.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they crucified two robbers also
  with him; one on the right hand, (and) one on the left hand of him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Omited <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they who were passing by were blaspheming
  him, shaking their heads, and saying: Thou (lit. he) who wilt pull down the
  temple, and wilt build it in three days, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> save thyself, having come down from the cross.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thus the chief priests also mocking
  with one another, saying: He saveth others; it is not possible for him to
  save himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Christ, (the) king of
  Israel, let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.'
  And they who were crucified with him were reproaching him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And (the) sixth hour having come, there was
  darkness upon all the earth until (the) ninth hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And at (the) ninth hour Jesus cried out with a
  great voice: Eloi, eloi, lema sabachtliani?' which for its interpretation is:
  My God, my God, wherefore didst thou leave me?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And some of them who stood (by), having heard,
  were saying: See, he calleth Elias.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  One, having run, filled a sponge with vinegar, placed it upon a reed, gave
  him to drink, saying: Let him (be); and let us see if (lit. that) Elias
  cometh and bringeth him down.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And
  Jesus, having called with a great voice, gave (up) the spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from
  (the) top down(wards). <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And the
  centurion, who stood opposite him, having seen that he gave (up) the spirit,
  said: Truly this man was (the) Son of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And there were also women seeing afar off, among
  whom was (imperf.) Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the little, and
  (the) mother of Josêtos, and Salome; <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span>
  who (lit. these who) were following him, when he was (lit. is being) in
  Galilee, and were ministering to him; and many others who came with him up to
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And now evening having
  come, since it was the Preparation, which was before (the) sabbath,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> came (lit. having come) Joseph the
  (man) from AriMatthewheas, being a councillor of honourable estate, who (lit.
  this who) himself also was looking for the kingdom of God; he dared, he went
  within to Pilate, and asked for (the) body of Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And Pilate wondered that be already died: and
  having called the centurion, he asked him whether he had just died.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And having known from the centurion,
  he gave the body of Jesus to Joseph. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span>
  And having bought a linen cloth, he brought him down, he wrapped him in a
  linen cloth, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock; and he
  rolled the stone to the door (lit. mouth) of the sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And Mary the Magdalene and Mary of Josêtos were
  seeing where he was laid.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._mark16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the sabbath having been kept,
  Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salomê went, they bought spices,
  that they might come and anoint him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And in the morning very (early) on (the) first (lit. one) of the sabbaths
  they came to the sepulchre, (the) sun having risen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they were saying to one another: Who will roll
  the stone for us from the door (lit. mouth) of the sepulchre?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and having lifted up their eyes, they saw the
  stone, that it was rolled (away): for it was very great. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having gone into the sepulchre, they saw a
  young man sitting on the right hand, clad in a white robe; and they feared.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to them: 'Fear not: ye
  seek for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified: he rose; he is not here: lo,
  the place in which they laid him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But
  go, say to his disciples and Peter, that he will go before you to Galilee: ye
  will see him there.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they came
  forth, they fled from the sepulchre; for trembling had seized them and
  amazement; and they said not anything to any one; for they were fearing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having risen indeed early on the
  first day of the sabbaths, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom
  he cast the seven demons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> She (lit.
  this who is there) went, she told them who had been (imperf.) with him,
  mourning and weeping. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they,
  having heard that he liveth, and that we saw him, were (imperf.) unbelieving.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And after these (things) again two of
  them were walking on a road, he manifested himself to them in another form in
  (the) field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And these also went,
  they told the rest: and these again believed them not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And at (the) end, (as) the eleven disciples were
  sitting-at-meat, he manifested himself to them; and he was reproaching them
  for their unbelief and their hardness of heart, because they believed not
  them who saw him, having risen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  he said to them: Go to the world, and in everything preach the Gospel to the
  whole creation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He who believed and
  who was baptised shall be saved: but he who was unbelieving will be
  condemned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And these signs shall
  follow (lit. walk after) them who believe in my name: they shall cast out
  demons; they shall speak in languages; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and they shall lift serpents in their hands; even
  if they should eat any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; and they shall
  lay their hands upon sick persons, and they shall be cured.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The Lord Jesus then, after his speaking to them,
  was taken up to (the) heaven, and sat on the right hand of(the) Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they, having come out, preached
  in all places, and the Lord was working with them, and (is) confirming the
  word by the signs which follow (lit. walk after) them, for ever and ever
  (lit. unto age of all the ages). Amen.</p>
