  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The presbyter to the chosen lady and her children,
  they whom I (pron.) love in [a] truth; and not I only, but also all who knew
  the truth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> because of the truth which
  abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> (The) grace, (the) mercy, (the) peace shall be
  with us from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, (the) Son of the
  Father, in [a] truth and [a] love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I
  rejoiced greatly, having found (certain) of thy children walking in [a]
  truth, according as we received commandment from the Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as that (it is)
  a new commandment which I write to thee, but this which we were having from
  (the) beginning, that we should love one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And this is [the] love, that we should walk
  according to his commandments. And this is the commandment, that according as
  ye heard from (the) beginning that we should walk in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Because many deceivers went to the world, they who
  confess not Jesus Christ, that he came in (the) flesh. This is the deceiver
  and the antichrist. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Look out for
  yourselves, that ye may not lose that which ye worked, but that ye may
  receive a complete reward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Every one
  who walketh onward, and stayeth not in the doctrine of Christ, is godless:
  but he who will stay in the doctrine of Christ, he hath the Father and (the)
  Son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He who cometh to you, and is
  bringing not this doctrine, take him not up into house, nor say to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he who will say to him 'Hail '
  shareth in his evil works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Having
  many things to write to you, [but] I wished not through [a] paper and [an]
  ink; for I hope to see you, and to speak to you mouth to mouth, that your joy
  may be complete. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The children of thy
  sister who is chosen salute thee.
