  <p>And it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive, and Jerusalem made
  desolate, that Jeremias sat weeping, and lamented with this lamentation over
  Jerusalem, and said <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> ALEPH. How does
  the city that was filled with people sit solitary! she is become as a widow:
  she that was magnified among the nations, and princess among the provinces,
  has become tributary. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> BETH. She weeps
  sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; and there is none of all
  her lovers to comfort her: all that were her friends have dealt deceitfully
  with her, they are become her enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  GIMEL. Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction, and by
  reason of the abundance of her servitude: she dwells among the nations, she
  has not found rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between her
  oppressors. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> DALETH. The ways of Sion
  mourn, because there are none that come to the feast: all her gates are
  ruined: her priests groan, her virgins are led captive, and she is in
  bitterness in herself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> HE. Her
  oppressors are become the head, and her enemies have prospered; for the Lord
  has afflicted her because of the multitude of her sins: her young children
  are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> VAU. And all her beauty has been taken away from
  the daughter of Sion: her princes were as rams finding no pasture, and are
  gone away in weakness before the face of the pursuer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> ZAIN. Jerusalem remembered the days of her
  affliction, and her rejection; she thought on all her desirable things which
  were from the days of old, when her people fell into the hands of the
  oppressor, and there was none to help her: when her enemies saw it they
  laughed at her habitation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> HETH.
  Jerusalem has sinned a great sin; therefore has she come into tribulation,
  all that used to honour her have afflicted her, for they have seen her shame:
  yea, she herself groaned, and turned backward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> TETH. Her uncleanness is before her feet; she
  remembered not her last end; she has lowered her boasting tone, there is none
  to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction: for the enemy has magnified
  himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> JOD. The oppressor has
  stretched out his hand on all her desirable things: for she has seen the
  Gentiles entering into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that
  they should not enter into thy congregation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> CHAPH. All her people groan, seeking bread: they
  have given their desirable things for meat, to restore their soul: behold,
  Lord, and look; for she is become dishonoured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> LAMED. All ye that pass by the way, turn, and see
  if there is sorrow like to my sorrow, which has happened to me. The Lord who
  spoke by me has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> MEM. He has sent fire from his lofty habitation,
  he has brought it into my bones: he has spread a net for my feet, he has
  turned me back: he has made me desolate and mourning all the day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> NUN. He has watched over my sins,
  they are twined about my hands, they have come up on my neck: my strength has
  failed; for the Lord has laid pains on my hands, I shall not be able to
  stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> SAMECH. The Lord has cut off
  all my strong men from the midst of me: he has summoned against me a time for
  crushing my choice men: the Lord has trodden a wine-press for the virgin
  daughter of Juda: for these things I weep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> AIN. Mine eye has poured out water, because he
  that should comfort me, that should restore my soul, has been removed far
  from me: my sons have been destroyed, because the enemy has prevailed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> PHE. Sion has spread out her hand,
  and there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob,
  his oppressors are round about him: Jerusalem has become among them as a
  removed woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> TSADE. The Lord is
  righteous; for I have provoked his mouth: hear, I pray you, all people, and
  behold my grief: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> KOPH. I called my lovers, but they
  deceived me: my priests and my elders failed in the city; for they sought
  meat that they might restore their souls, and found it not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> RHECHS. Behold, O Lord; for I am afflicted: my
  belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me; for I have been
  grievously rebellious: abroad the sword has bereaved me, even as death at
  home. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> CHSEN. Hear, I pray you, for I
  groan: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of mine
  afflictions, and rejoice because thou hast done it: thou hast brought on the
  day, thou hast called the time: they are become like to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> THAU. Let all their wickedness come before thy
  face; and strip them, as they have made a gleaning for all my sins: for my
  groans are many, and my heart is grieved.</p>

  <h3 id="lamentations_of_jeremiah2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> ALEPH. How has the Lord darkened in
  his wrath the daughter of Sion! he has cast down the glory of Israel from
  heaven to earth, and has not remembered his footstool. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> BETH. In the day of his wrath the Lord has
  overwhelmed her as in the sea, and not spared: he has brought down in his
  fury all the beautiful things of Jacob; he has brought down to the ground the
  strong-holds of the daughter of Juda; he has profaned her kings and her
  princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> GIMEL. He has broken in his
  fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has turned back his right hand from
  the face of the enemy, and has kindled a flame in Jacob as a fire, and it has
  devoured all things round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  DALETH. He has bent his bow as an opposing enemy: he has strengthened his
  right hand as an adversary, and has destroyed all the desirable things of my
  eyes in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion: he has poured forth his anger
  as fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> HE. The Lord is become as an
  enemy: he has overwhelmed Israel as in the sea, he has overwhelmed her
  palaces: he has destroyed her strong-holds, and has multiplied the afflicted
  and humbled ones to the daughter of Juda. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> VAU. And he has scattered his tabernacle as a
  vine, he has marred his feast: the Lord has forgotten the feast and the
  sabbath which he appointed in Sion, and in the fury of his wrath has vexed
  the king, and priest, and prince. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  ZAIN. The Lord has rejected his altar, he has cast off his sanctuary, he has
  broken by the hand of the enemy the wall of her palaces; they have uttered
  their voice in the house of the Lord as on a feast day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> HETH. And he has turned to destroy the wall of the
  daughter of Sion: he has stretched out the measuring line, he has not turned
  back his hand from afflicting her: therefore the bulwark mourned, and the
  wall was weakened with it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> TETH. Her
  gates are sunk into the ground: he has destroyed and broken to pieces her
  bars, and her king and her prince among the Gentiles: there is no law, nay,
  her prophets have seen no vision from the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> JOD. The elders of the daughter of Sion have sat
  upon the ground, they have kept silence: they have cast up dust upon their
  heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloths: they have brought down to
  the ground the chief virgins in Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> CHAPH. Mine eyes have failed with tears, my heart
  is troubled, my glory is cast down to the ground, for the destruction of the
  daughter of my people; while the infant and suckling swoon in the streets of
  the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> LAMED. They said to their
  mothers, Where is corn and wine? while they fainted like wounded men in the
  streets of the city, while their souls were poured out into their motherâ€™s
  bosom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> MEM. What shall I testify to
  thee, or what shall I compare to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? who shall
  save and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for the cup of thy
  destruction is enlarged: who shall heal thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> NUN. Thy prophets have seen for thee vanities and
  folly: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn back thy
  captivity; but they have seen for thee vain burdens, and worthless visions.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> SAMECH. All that go by the way have
  clapped their hands at thee; they have hissed and shaken their head at the
  daughter of Jerusalem. Is this the city, they say, the crown of joy of all
  the earth? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> AIN. All thine enemies
  have opened their mouth against thee: they have hissed and gnashed their
  teeth, and said, We have swallowed her up: moreover this is the day which we
  looked for; we have found it, we have seen it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> PHE. The Lord has done that which he purposed; he
  has accomplished his word, even the things which he commanded from the
  ancient days: he has thrown down, and has not spared: and he has caused the
  enemy to rejoice over thee, he has exalted the horn of him that afflicted
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> TSADE. Their heart cried to the
  Lord, Ye walls of Sion, pour down tears like torrents day and night: give
  thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eyes cease. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> KOPH. Arise, rejoice in the night at the
  beginning of thy watch: pour out thy heart as water before the face of the
  Lord; lift up thy hands to him for the life of thine infants, who faint for
  hunger at the top of all the streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  RHECHS. Behold, O Lord, and see for whom thou has gathered thus. Shall the
  women eat the fruit of their womb? the cook has made a gathering: shall the
  infants sucking at the breasts be slain? wilt thou slay the priest and
  prophet in the sanctuary of the Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  CHSEN. The child and old man have lain down in the street: my virgins and my
  young men are gone into captivity: thou hast slain them with the sword and
  with famine; in the day of thy wrath thou hast mangled them, thou has not
  spared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> THAU. He has called my
  sojourners round about to a solemn day, and there was not in the day of the
  wrath of the Lord any one that escaped or was left; whereas I have
  strengthened and multiplied all mine enemies.</p>

  <h3 id="lamentations_of_jeremiah3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> ALEPH. I am the man that sees
  poverty, through the rod of his wrath upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He has taken me, and led me away into darkness,
  and not into light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Nay, against me
  has he turned his hand all the day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He
  has made old my flesh and my skin; he has broken my bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> BETH. He has built against me, and compassed my
  head, and brought travail upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He
  has set me in dark places, as them that have long been dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He has builded against me, and I cannot come
  forth: he has made my brazen chain heavy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> GIMEL. Yea, though I cry and shout, he shuts out
  my prayer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> DALETH. He has built up my
  ways, he has hedged my paths; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he has
  troubled me, as a she-bear lying in wait: he is to me as a lion in secret
  places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He pursued me after I
  departed, and brought me to a stand: he has utterly ruined me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> HE. He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for
  the arrow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He has caused the arrows
  of his quiver to enter into my reins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  I became a laughing-stock to all my people; and their song all the day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> VAU. He has filled me with
  bitterness, he has drenched me with gall. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he has dashed out my teeth with gravel, he
  has fed me with ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He has also
  removed my soul from peace: I forgot prosperity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Therefore my success has perished, and my hope
  from the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> ZAIN. I remembered by
  reason of my poverty, and because of persecution my bitterness and gall shall
  be remembered; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and my soul shall
  meditate with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> This will I lay up
  in my heart, therefore I will endure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  HETH. It is the mercies of the Lord, that he has not failed me, because his
  compassions are not exhausted. Pity us, O Lord, early every month: for we are
  not brought to an end, because his compassions are not exhausted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> They are new every morning: great is
  thy faithfulness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The Lord is my
  portion, says my soul; therefore will I wait for him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> TETH. The Lord is good to them that wait for him:
  the soul which shall seek him <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> is
  good, and shall wait for, and quietly expect salvation of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> TETH. It is good for a man when he
  bears a yoke in his youth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He will
  sit alone, and be silent, because he has borne it upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> JOD. He
  will give his cheek to him that smites him: he will be filled full with
  reproaches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For the Lord will not
  reject for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> CHAPH. For he that
  has brought down will pity, and that according to the abundance of his mercy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> He has not answered in anger from his
  heart, though he has brought low the children of a man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> LAMED. To bring down under his feet all the
  prisoners of the earth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> to turn aside
  the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> to condemn a man unjustly in his judgment, the
  Lord has not given commandment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Who
  has thus spoken, and it has come to pass? the Lord has not commanded it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Out of the mouth of the Most High
  there shall not come forth evil and good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> MEM. Why should a living man complain, a man
  concerning his sin? <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> NUN. Our way has
  been searched out and examined, and we will turn to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Let us lift up our hearts with our hand to the
  lofty One in heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> We have sinned,
  we have transgressed; and thou hast not pardoned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> SAMECH. Thou has visited us in wrath, and driven
  us away: thou has slain, thou has not pitied. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Thou hast veiled thyself with a cloud because of
  prayer, that I might be blind, <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> and be
  cast off. AIN. Thou hast set us alone in the midst of the nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> All our enemies have opened their
  mouth against us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Fear and wrath are
  come upon us, suspense and destruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Mine eye shall pour down torrents of water, for
  the destruction of the daughter of my people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> PHE. Mine eye is drowned with tears, and I will
  not be silent, so that there shall be no rest, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> until the Lord look down, and behold from heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Mine eye shall prey upon my soul,
  because of all the daughters of the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> TSADE. The fowlers chased me as a sparrow, all
  mine enemies destroyed my life in a pit without cause, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> and laid a stone upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> Water flowed over my head: I said, I am cut off.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> KOPH. I called upon thy name, O Lord,
  out of the lowest dungeon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Thou
  heardest my voice: close not thine ears to my supplication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> Thou drewest nigh to my help: in the day wherein
  I called upon thee thou saidst to me, Fear not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> RECHS. O Lord, thou has pleaded the causes of my
  soul; thou has redeemed my life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Thou
  hast seen, O Lord, my troubles: thou hast judged my cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(60)</span> Thou hast seen all their vengeance, thou hast
  looked on all their devices against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(61)</span> CHSEN. Thou hast heard their reproach and all
  their devices against me; <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> the lips of
  them that rose up against me, and their plots against me all the day;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> their sitting down and their rising
  up: look thou upon their eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Thou
  wilt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(65)</span> THAU. Thou wilt give them as a
  covering, the grief of my heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> Thou
  wilt persecute them in anger, and wilt consume them from under the heaven, O
  Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="lamentations_of_jeremiah4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> ALEPH. How will the gold be
  tarnished, and the fine silver changed! the sacred stones have been poured
  forth at the top of all the streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  BETH. The precious sons of Zion, who were equalled in value with gold, how
  are they counted as earthen vessels, the works of the hands of the potter!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> GIMEL. Nay, serpents have drawn out
  the breasts, they give suck to their young, the daughters of my people are
  incurably cruel, as an ostrich in a desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> DALETH. The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to
  the roof of its mouth for thirst: the little children ask for bread, and
  there is none to break it to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> HE.
  They that feed on dainties are desolate in the streets: they that used to be
  nursed in scarlet have clothed themselves with dung. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> VAU. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people
  has been increased beyond the iniquities of Sodoma, the city that was
  overthrown very suddenly, and none laboured against her with their hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> ZAIN. Her Nazarites were made purer
  than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were purified as with fire, their
  polishing was superior to sapphire stone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> HETH. Their countenance is become blacker than
  smoke; they are not known in the streets: their skin has cleaved to their
  bones; they are withered, they are become as a stick. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> TETH. The slain with the sword were better than
  they that were slain with hunger: they have departed, pierced through from
  want of the fruits of the field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> JOD.
  The hands of tender-hearted women have sodden their own children: they became
  meat for them in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> CHAPH. The Lord has accomplished his wrath; he
  has poured out fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Sion, and it has
  devoured her foundations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> LAMED. The
  kings of the earth, even all that dwell in the world, believed not that an
  enemy and oppressor would enter through the gates of Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> MEM. For the sins of her prophets, and iniquities
  of her priests, who shed righteous blood in the midst of her, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> NUN. her watchmen staggered in the streets, they
  were defiled with blood in their weakness, they touched their raiment with
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> SAMECH. Depart ye from the
  unclean ones: call ye them: depart, depart, touch them not: for they are on
  fire, yea, they stagger: say ye among the nations, They shall no more sojourn
  there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> AIN. The presence of the Lord
  was their portion; but he will not again look upon them: they regarded not
  the person of the priests, they pitied not the prophets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> PHE. While we yet lived our eyes failed, while we
  looked in vain for our help. TSADE. We looked to a nation that could not
  save. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> We have hunted for our little
  ones, that they should not walk in our streets. KOPH. Our time has drawn
  nigh, our days are fulfilled, our time is come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the
  sky, they flew on the mountains, in the wilderness they laid wait for us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> RECHS. The breath of our nostrils,
  our anointed Lord, was taken in their destructive snares, of whom we said, In
  his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> CHSEN. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Idumea,
  that dwellest in the land: yet the cup of the Lord shall pass through to
  thee: thou shalt be drunken, and pour forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> THAU. O daughter of Sion, thine iniquity has come
  to an end; he shall no more carry thee captive: he has visited thine
  iniquities, O daughter of Edom; he has discovered thy sins.</p>

  <h3 id="lamentations_of_jeremiah5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Remember, O Lord, what has happened
  to us: behold, and look on our reproach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Our inheritance has been turned away to aliens,
  our houses to strangers: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> we are become
  orphans, we have no father, our mothers are as widows. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> We have drunk our water for money; our wood is
  sold to us for a burden on our neck: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  we have been persecuted, we have laboured, we have had no rest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Egypt gave the hand to us, Assur to their own
  satisfaction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Our fathers sinned, and
  are not: we have borne their iniquities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Servants have ruled over us: there is none to
  ransom us out of their hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> We shall
  bring in our bread with danger of our lives, because of the sword of the
  wilderness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Our skin is blackened
  like an oven; they are convulsed, because of the storms of famine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They humbled the women in Sion, the
  virgins in the cities of Juda. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Princes were hanged up by their hands: the elders were not honoured.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The chosen men lifted up the voice in
  weeping, and the youths fainted under the wood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the elders ceased from the gate, the chosen
  men ceased from their music. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The joy
  of our heart has ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The crown has fallen from our head: yea, woe to
  us! for we have sinned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For this has
  grief come; our heart is sorrowful: for this our eyes are darkened.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Over the mountain of Sion, because it
  is made desolate, foxes have walked therein. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But thou, O Lord, shalt dwell for ever; thy
  throne shall endure to generation and generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Wherefore wilt thou utterly forget us, and
  abandon us a long time? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Turn us, O
  Lord, to thee, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as before.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For thou hast indeed rejected us;
  thou hast been very wroth against us.</p>
