  <h3 id="hosea1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The word of the
  Lord which came to Osee the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, and Joatham,
  and Achaz, and Ezekias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of
  Joas, king of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The beginning of
  the word of the Lord by Osee. And the Lord said to Osee, Go, take to thyself
  a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: for the land will surely
  go a-whoring in departing from the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Debelaim;
  and she conceived, and bore him a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little while, and
  I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Juda, and will make to
  cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And it shall be, in that day, that I will break
  the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And
  he said to him, Call her name, Unpitied: for I will no more have mercy on the
  house of Israel, but will surely set myself in array against them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I will have mercy on the house of
  Juda, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them with
  bow, nor with sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by horsemen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And she weaned Unpitied; and she conceived again,
  and bore a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said, Call his
  name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I am not your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Yet the number of the children of
  Israel was as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured nor numbered:
  and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, Ye
  are not my people, even they shall be called the sons of the living God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the children of Juda shall be
  gathered, and the children of Israel together, and shall appoint themselves
  one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
  Jezrael.
  <h3 id="hosea2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Say to your
  brother, My people, and to your sister, Pitied. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my
  wife, and I am not her husband: and I will remove her fornication out of my
  presence, and her adultery from between her breasts: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> that I may strip her naked, and make her again as
  she was at the day of her birth: and I will make her desolate, and make her
  as a dry land, and will kill her with thirst. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will not have mercy upon her children; for
  they are children of fornication. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  their mother went a-whoring: she that bore them disgraced them: for she said,
  I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, and my
  garments, and my linen clothes, my oil and my necessaries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore, behold, I hedge up her way with thorns,
  and I will stop the ways, and she shall not find her path. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall
  not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: and she
  shall say, I will go, and return to my former husband; for it was better with
  me than now. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And she knew not that I
  gave her her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied silver to her: but she
  made silver and gold images for Baal. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Therefore I will return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in
  its time; and I will take away my raiment and my linen clothes, so that she
  shall not cover her nakedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  now I will expose her uncleanness before her lovers, and no one shall by any
  means deliver her out of my hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  I will take away all her gladness, her feasts, and her festivals at the new
  moon, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will utterly destroy her vines, and her
  fig-trees, all things of which she said, These are my hire which my lovers
  have given me: and I will make them a testimony, and the wild beasts of the
  field, and the birds of the sky, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will recompense on her
  the days of Baalim, wherein she sacrificed to them, and put on her ear-rings,
  and her necklaces, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore, behold, I will cause her
  to err, and will make her as desolate, and will speak comfortably to her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I will giver her possessions from
  thence, and the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be
  afflicted there according to the days of her infancy, and according to the
  days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
  Lord, that she shall call me, My husband, and shall no longer call me Baalim.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will take away the names of
  Baalim out of her mouth, and their names shall be remembered no more at all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I will make for them in that day
  a covenant with the wild beasts of the field, and with the birds of the sky,
  and with the reptiles of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword
  and the battle from off the earth, and will cause thee to dwell safely.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will betroth thee to myself for
  ever; yea, I will betroth thee to myself in righteousness, and in judgment,
  and in mercy, and in tender compassions; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and I will betroth thee to myself in
  faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
  Lord, I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and the earth shall hearken to the
  corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hearken to Jezrael.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will sow her to me on the
  earth; and will love her that was not loved, and will say to that which was
  not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art the Lord my
  God.
  <h3 id="hosea3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  said to me, Go yet, and love a woman that loves evil things, an adulteress,
  even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, and they have respect to
  strange gods, and love cakes of dried grapes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> So I hired her to myself for fifteen pieces of
  silver, and a homer of barley, and a flagon of wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I said unto her, Thou shalt wait for me many
  days; and thou shalt not commit fornication, neither shalt thou be for
  another man; and I will be for thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without
  a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a
  priesthood, and without manifestations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And afterward shall the children of Israel return,
  and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall be amazed
  at the Lord and at his goodness in the latter days.
  <h3 id="hosea4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear the word of
  the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord has a controversy with the
  inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge
  of God in the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Cursing, and
  lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound in the land, and they
  mingle blood with blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore
  shall the land mourn, and shall be diminished with all that dwell in it, with
  the wild beasts of the field, and the reptiles of the earth, and with the
  birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea shall fail: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that neither any one may plead, nor any one
  reprove another; but my people are as a priest spoken against. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore they shall fall by day, and the prophet
  with thee shall fall: I have compared thy mother unto night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> My people are like as if they had no knowledge:
  because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
  shalt not minister as priest to me: and as thou has forgotten the law of thy
  God, I also will forget thy children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  According to their multitude, so they sinned against me: I will turn their
  glory into shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They will devour the
  sins of my people, and will set their hearts on their iniquities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the priest shall be as the people:
  and I will avenge on them their ways, and I will recompense to them their
  counsels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they shall eat, and
  shall not be satisfied: they have gone a-whoring, and shall by no means
  prosper: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The heart of my people has gladly engaged in
  fornication and wine and strong drink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They asked counsel by means of signs, and they
  reported answer to them by their staves: they have gone astray in a spirit of
  whoredom, and gone grievously a-whoring from their God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They have sacrificed on the tops of the
  mountains, and on the hills they have sacrificed under the oak and poplar,
  and under the shady tree, because the shade was good: therefore your
  daughters shall go a-whoring, and your daughters-in-law shall commit
  adultery. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will not visit upon
  your daughters when they shall commit fornication, nor your daughters-in-law
  when they shall commit adultery: for they themselves mingled themselves with
  harlots, and sacrificed with polluted ones, and the people that understood
  not entangled itself with a harlot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  But thou, O Israel, be not ignorant, and go ye not, men of Juda, to Galgala;
  and go not up to the house of On, and swear not by the living Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For Israel was maddened like a mad
  heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a wide place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Ephraim, joined with idols, has laid
  stumbling-blocks in his own way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He
  has chosen the Chananites: they have grievously gone a-whoring: they have
  loved dishonour through her insolence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou art a blast of wind in her wings, and they
  shall be ashamed because of their altars.
  <h3 id="hosea5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear these
  things, ye priests; and attend, O house of Israel; and hearken, O house of
  the king; for the controversy is with you, because ye have been a snare in
  Scopia, and as a net spread on Itabyrium, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> which they that hunt the prey have fixed: but I
  will correct you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I know Ephraim, and
  Israel is not far from me: for now Ephraim has gone grievously a-whoring,
  Israel is defiled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They have not
  framed their counsels to return to their God, for the spirit of fornication
  is in them, and they have not known the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the pride of Israel shall be brought low
  before his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquities; and
  Judas also shall fall with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They
  shall go with sheep and calves diligently to seek the Lord; but they shall
  not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For they have forsaken the Lord; for strange
  children have been born to them: now shall the cankerworm devour them and
  their heritages. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Blow ye the trumpet
  on the hills, sound aloud on the heights: proclaim in the house of On,
  Benjamin is amazed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Ephraim has come
  to nought in the days of reproof: in the tribes of Israel I have shown
  faithful dealings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The princes of
  Juda became as they that removed the bounds: I will pour out upon them my
  fury as water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ephraim altogether
  prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgment under foot, for he began to
  go after vanities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore I will
  be as consternation to Ephraim, and as a goad to the house of Juda.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Ephraim saw his disease, and
  Judas his pain; then Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to
  king Jarim: but he could not heal you, and your pain shall in nowise cease
  from you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Wherefore I am as a panther
  to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Juda: and I will tear, and go away;
  and I will take, and there shall be none to deliver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I will go and return to my place, until they are
  brought to nought, and then shall they seek my face.
  <h3 id="hosea6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In their
  affliction they will seek me early, saying, Let us go, and return to the Lord
  our God; for he has torn, and will heal us; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> he will smite, and bind us up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> After two days he will heal us: in the third day
  we shall arise, and live before him, and shall know him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> let us follow on to know the Lord: we shall find
  him ready as the morning, and he will come to us as the early and latter rain
  to the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> What shall I do unto
  thee, Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, Juda? whereas your mercy is as a
  morning cloud, and as the early dew that goes away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have
  slain them with the word of my mouth: and my judgment shall go forth as the
  light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For I will have mercy rather
  than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than whole-burnt-offerings.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But they are as a man transgressing a
  covenant: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> there the city Galaad
  despised me, working vanity, troubling water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thy strength is that of a robber: the priests
  have hid the way, they have murdered the people of Sicima; for they have
  wrought iniquity in the house of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I have seen horrible things there, even the
  fornication of Ephraim: Israel and Juda are defiled; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> begin together grapes for thyself, when I turn
  the captivity of my people.
  <h3 id="hosea7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> When I have
  healed Israel, then shall the iniquity of Ephraim be revealed, and the
  wickedness of Samaria; for they have wrought falsehood: and a thief shall
  come in to him, even a robber spoiling in his way; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that they may concert together as men singing in
  their heart: I remember all their wickedness: now have their own counsels
  compassed them about; they came before my face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They gladdened kings with their wickedness, and
  princes with their lies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They are all
  adulterers, as an oven glowing with flame for hot-baking, on account of the
  kneading of the dough, until it is leavened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In the days of our kings, the princes began to be
  inflamed with wine: he stretched out his hand with pestilent fellows.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Wherefore their hearts are inflamed as
  an oven, while they rage all the night: Ephraim is satisfied with sleep; the
  morning is come; he is burnt up as a flame of fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They are all heated like an oven, and have
  devoured their judges: all their kings are fallen; there was not among them
  one that called on me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Ephraim is
  mixed among his people; Ephraim became a cake not turned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Strangers devoured his strength, and he knew it
  not; and grey hairs came upon him, and he knew it not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the pride of Israel shall be brought down
  before his face: yet they have not returned to the Lord their God, neither
  have they diligently sought him for all this. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Ephraim was as a silly dove, not having a
  heart: he called to Egypt, and they went to the Assyrians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Whenever they shall go, I will cast my net upon
  them; I will bring them down as the birds of the sky, I will chasten them
  with the rumor of their coming affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Woe to them! for they have started aside from me:
  they are cowards; for they have sinned against me: yet I redeemed them, but
  they spoke falsehoods against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  their hearts did not cry to me, but they howled on their beds: they pined for
  oil and wine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They were instructed by
  me, and I strengthened their arms; and they devised evils against me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They turned aside to that which is
  not, they became as a bent bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, by
  reason of the unbridled state of their tongue: this is their setting at
  nought in the land of Egypt.
  <h3 id="hosea8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> He shall come
  into their midst as the land, as an eagle against the house of the Lord,
  because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> They shall soon cry out to me, saying,
  O God, we know thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For Israel has
  turned away from good things; they have pursued an enemy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They have made kings for themselves, but not by
  me: they have ruled, but they did not make it known to me: of their silver
  and their gold they have made images to themselves, that they might be
  destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Cast off thy calf, O
  Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be unable to
  purge themselves in Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Whereas
  the workman made it, and it is not God; wherefore thy calf, Samaria, was a
  deceiver: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for they sowed blighted
  seed, and their destruction shall await them, a sheaf of corn that avails not
  to make meal; and even if it should produce it, strangers shall devour it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Israel is swallowed up: now is he
  become among the nations as a worthless vessel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For they have gone up to the Assyrians: Ephraim
  has been strengthened against himself; they loved gifts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore shall they be delivered to the nations:
  now I will receive them, and they shall cease a little to anoint a king and
  princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Because Ephraim has
  multiplied altars, his beloved altars are become sins to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I will write down a multitude of commands for
  him; but his statutes are accounted strange things, even the beloved altars.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For if they should offer a sacrifice,
  and eat flesh, the lord will not accept them: now will he remember their
  iniquities, and will take vengeance on their sins: they have returned to
  Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things among the Assyrians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Israel has forgotten him that made him, and
  they have built fanes, and Juda has multiplied walled cities: but I will send
  fire on his cities, and it shall devour their foundations.
  <h3 id="hosea9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Rejoice not, O
  Israel, neither make merry, as other nations: for thou hast gone a-whoring
  from thy God; thou hast loved gifts upon every threshing-floor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The threshing-floor and wine-press knew them not,
  and the wine disappointed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They
  dwelt not in the Lord’s land: Ephraim dwelt in Egypt, and they shall eat
  unclean things among the Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  They have not offered wine to the Lord, neither have their sacrifices been
  sweet to him, but as the bread of mourning to them; all that eat them shall
  be defiled; for their bread for their soul shall not enter into the house of
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> What will ye do in the day
  of the general assembly, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore, behold, they go forth from
  the trouble of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them, and Machmas shall bury
  them: as for their silver, destruction shall inherit it; thorns shall be in
  their tents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The days of vengeance are
  come, the days of thy recompense are come; and Israel shall be afflicted as
  the prophet that is mad, as a man deranged: by reason of the multitude of
  thine iniquities thy madness has abounded. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The watchman of Ephraim was with God: the prophet
  is a crooked snare in all his ways: they have established madness in the
  house of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They have corrupted
  themselves according to the days of the hill: he will remember their
  iniquities, he will take vengeance on their sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness, and I
  saw their fathers as an early watchman in a fig-tree: they went in to
  Beel-phegor, and were shamefully estranged, and the abominable became as the
  beloved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ephraim has flown away as a
  bird; their glories from the birth, and the travail, and the conception.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For even if they should rear their
  children, yet shall they be utterly bereaved: wherefore also there is woe to
  them, though my flesh is of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Ephraim, even as I saw, gave their children for a prey; yea, Ephraim was
  ready to bring out his children to slaughter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Give them, O Lord: what wilt thou give them? a
  miscarrying womb, and dry breasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  All their wickedness is in Galgal: for there I hated them: because of the
  wickedness of their practices, I will cast them out of my house, I will not
  love them any more: all their princes are disobedient. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Ephraim is sick, he is dried up at his roots, he
  shall in no wise any more bear fruit: wherefore even if they should beget
  children, I will kill the desired fruit of their womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> God shall reject them, because they have not
  hearkened to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
  <h3 id="hosea10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Israel is a
  vine with goodly branches, her fruit is abundant: according to the multitude
  of her fruits she has multiplied her altars; according to the wealth of his
  land, he has set up pillars. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> They have
  divided their hearts; now shall they be utterly destroyed: he shall dig down
  their altars, their pillars shall mourn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Because now they shall say, We have no king,
  because we feared not the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and
  what should a king do for us, speaking false professions as his words? he
  will make a covenant: judgment shall spring up as a weed on the soil of the
  field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The inhabitants of Samaria
  shall dwell near the calf of the house of On; for the people of it mourned
  for it: and as they provoked him, they shall rejoice at his glory, because he
  has departed from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And having
  bound it for the Assyrians, they carried it away as presents to king Jarim:
  Ephraim shall receive a gift, and Israel shall be ashamed of his counsel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Samaria has cast off her king as a
  twig on the surface of the water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  the altars of On, the sins of Israel, shall be taken away: thorns and
  thistles shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains,
  Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> From the time the hills existed Israel has sinned:
  there they stood: war waged against the children of iniquity <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> to chastise them shall not overtake them on the
  hill, the nations shall be gathered against them, when they are chastened for
  their two sins, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ephraim is a heifer
  taught to love victory, but I will come upon the fairest part of her neck: I
  will mount Ephraim; I will pass over Juda in silence; Jacob shall prevail
  against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Sow to yourselves for
  righteousness, gather in for the fruit of life: light ye for yourselves the
  light of knowledge; seek the Lord till the fruits of righteousness come upon
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Wherefore have ye passed over
  ungodliness in silence, and reaped the sins of it? ye have eaten false fruit;
  for thou has trusted in thy sins, in the abundance of thy power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore shall destruction rise up among thy
  people, and all thy strong places shall be ruined: as a prince Solomon
  departed out of the house of Jeroboam, in the days of battle they dashed the
  mother to the ground upon the children, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> thus will I do to you, O house of Israel, because
  of the unrighteousness of your sins.
  <h3 id="hosea11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Early in the
  morning were they cast off, the king of Israel has been cast off: for Israel
  is a child, and I loved him, and out of Egypt have I called his children.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> As I called them, so they departed
  from my presence: they sacrificed to Baalim, and burnt incense to graven
  images. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Yet I bound the feet of
  Ephraim, I took him on my arm; but they knew not that I healed them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> When men were destroyed, I drew them
  with the bands of my love: and I will be to them as a man smiting another on
  his cheek: and I will have respect to him, I will prevail with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Ephraim dwelt in Egypt; and as for the
  Assyrian, he was his king, because he would not return. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And in his cities he prevailed not with the sword,
  and he ceased to war with his hands: and they shall eat of the fruit of their
  own devices: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and his people shall
  cleave fondly to their habitation; but God shall be angry with his precious
  things, and shall not at all exalt him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> How shall I deal with thee, Ephraim? how shall I
  protect thee, Israel? what shall I do with thee? I will make thee as Adama,
  and as Seboim; my heart is turned at once, my repentance is powerfully
  excited. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I will not act according to
  the fury of my wrath, I will not abandon Ephraim to be utterly destroyed: for
  I am God, and not man; the Holy One within thee: and I will not enter into
  the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I will go after the Lord:
  he shall utter his voice as a lion: for he shall roar, and the children of
  the waters shall be amazed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They
  shall be amazed and fly as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land
  of the Assyrians: and I will restore them to their houses, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ephraim has compassed me with
  falsehood, and the house of Israel and Juda with ungodliness: but now God
  knows them, and they shall be called God’s holy people.
  <h3 id="hosea12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Ephraim is
  an evil spirit, he has chased the east wind all the day: he has multiplied
  empty and vain things, and made a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil has
  gone in the way of traffic into Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And the Lord has a controversy with Juda, in order to punish Jacob: according
  to his ways and according to his practices will he recompense him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He took his brother by the heel in the
  womb, and in his labours he had power with God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he prevailed with the angel and was strong:
  they wept, and intreated me: they found me in the house of On, and there a
  word was spoken to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the Lord
  God Almighty shall be his memorial. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Thou therefore shalt return to thy God: keep thou mercy and judgment, and
  draw nigh to thy God continually. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> As
  for Chanaan, in his hand is a balance of unrighteousness: he has loved to
  tyrannize. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Ephraim said,
  Nevertheless I am rich, I have found refreshment to myself. None of his
  labours shall be found available to him, by reason of the sins which he has
  committed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But I the Lord thy God
  brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: I will yet cause thee to dwell in
  tabernacles, according to the days of the feast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I will speak to the prophets, and I have
  multiplied visions, and by the means of the prophets I was represented.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If Galaad exists not, then the chiefs
  in Galaad when they sacrificed were false, and their altars were as heaps on
  the ground of the field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Jacob
  retreated into the plain of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and waited
  for a wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord brought
  Israel out of the land of Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet was he
  preserve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ephraim was angry and
  excited, therefore his blood shall be poured out upon him, and the Lord shall
  recompense to him his reproach.
  <h3 id="hosea13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> According to
  the word of Ephraim he adopted ordinances for himself in Israel; and he
  established them for Baal, and died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And now they have sinned increasingly, and have made for themselves a molten
  image of their silver, according to the fashion of idols, the work of
  artificers accomplished for them: they say, Sacrifice men, for the calves
  have come to an end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore shall
  they be as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as chaff
  blown away from the threshing-floor, and as a vapor from tears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But I am the Lord thy God that establishes the
  heaven, and creates the earth, whose hands have framed the whole host of
  heaven: but I shewed them not to thee that thou shouldest go after them: and
  I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but
  me; and there is no Saviour beside me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  I tended thee as a shepherd in the wilderness, in an uninhabited land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> According to their pastures, so they
  were completely filled; and their hearts were exalted; therefore they forgot
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will be to them as a
  panther, and as a leopard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I will meet
  them by the way of the Assyrians, as a she-bear excited, and I will rend the
  caul of their heart, and the lions’ whelps of the thicket shall devour them
  there; the wild beasts of the field shall rend them in pieces. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> O Israel, who will aid thee in thy destruction?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Where is this thy king? let him even
  save thee in all thy cities: let him judge thee, of whom thou saidst, Give me
  a king and a prince. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I gave thee
  a king in mine anger, and kept him back in my wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ephraim has framed a conspiracy of
  unrighteousness, his sin is hidden. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Pains as of a woman in travail shall come upon him: he is thy wise son,
  because he shall not stay in the destruction of thy children. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I will deliver them out of the power of Hades,
  and will redeem them from death: where is thy penalty, O death? O Hades,
  where is thy sting? comfort is hidden from mine eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Forasmuch as he will cause a division among his
  brethren, the Lord shall bring upon him an east wind from the desert, and
  shall dry up his veins and quite drain his fountains: he shall dry up his
  land, and spoil all his precious vessels.
  <h3 id="hosea14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Samaria shall
  be utterly destroyed: for she has resisted her God; they shall fall by the
  sword, and their sucklings shall be dashed against the ground, and their
  women with child ripped up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Return, O
  Israel, to the Lord thy God; for the people have fallen through thine
  iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Take with you words, and
  turn to the Lord your God: speak to him, that ye may not receive the reward
  of unrighteousness, but that ye may receive good things: and we will render
  in return the fruit of our lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Assur
  shall never save us; we will not mount on horseback; we will no longer say to
  the works of our hands, Our gods. He who is in thee shall pity the orphan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I will restore their dwellings, I will
  love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the
  lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a
  fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as the smell of Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They shall return, and dwell under his shadow:
  they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine:
  his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What has he to do any more with idols? I have
  afflicted him, and I will strengthen him: I am as a leafy juniper tree. From
  me is thy fruit found. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Who is wise,
  and will understand these things? or prudent, and will know them? for the
  ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous shall walk in them: but the
  ungodly shall fall therein.
