  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Simōn Petros, (the) servant and
  (the) apostle of Jesus Christ, to them who are equal in honour with us in
  (the) faith, which was allotted to us in the righteousness of our God and our
  saviour Jesus Christ our Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> (the)
  grace and the peace may they be multiplied to you, In (the) knowledge of God,
  and our Lord Jesus Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> since all
  things became ours (lit. to us) in the power of his deity, (tending) towards
  (the) life, and [the] godliness, which was given to us freely, through (the)
  knowledge of him who called us into his glory and [the] virtue; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and through these great (and) precious glories
  which were given to us as gifts, that through these ye might become sharers
  of (the) nature of the deity, escaping from the lust of (the) corruption
  which is in the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And in this,
  bringing in all diligence, supply [the] virtue in your faith: in [the]
  virtue, [the] knowledge: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> in [the]
  knowledge, [the] temperance: in [the] temperance, [the] patience: in [the]
  patience, [the] godliness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> in [the]
  godliness, [the] brotherly love: in [the] brotherly love, [the] love.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But all these being yours (lit. to
  you), and abounding in you, they will not make you idle and unfruitful
  towards (the) knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He to whom these things are not is blind, feeling
  (his way), having taken a forgetfulness of (the) cleansing of his former
  sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore rather, our brethren,
  hasten yourselves that through [the] good works ye may confirm your calling
  and your election: for doing these things ye shall never stumble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For thus richly the entering shall be
  supplied to you of (the) eternal kingdom of our Lord and our saviour Jesus
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore I shall (lit. will)
  remind you always concerning these things, although ye know, and ye are
  confirmed in the truth which is. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For
  I think that it is a righteous work, this which I think, that as long as I am
  in this dwelling-place I shall stir in you a remembrance; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> knowing that this dwelling-place will be
  dissolved quickly, according as also our Lord Jesus Christ showed to us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I shall (lit. will) hasten myself
  always, that ye may remember these things after my departure. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> It was not crafty fables which we walked after,
  (when) we showed to you (the) power and (the) coming of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of the greatness of that (one): <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> he received [an] honour and [a] glory from the
  Father; and a voice came to him of this kind by the exceeding great glory:
  'This is my Son, my beloved, this for whom I was well pleased.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And this voice we heard, coining from (the)
  heaven, being with him on the holy mountain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the word of the prophets is for us firm, this
  to which ye do well to attend (lit. observing), as a lamp shining in a place
  of darkness, until is manifested the day, and the light ariseth and breaketh
  forth in your hearts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But first
  knowing this, that all prophecies of the Scriptures--their explanation was
  being made not for themselves alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  For neither by (the) wish of man was a prophecy brought at a time, but men
  spake by (the) wish of God in the holy spirit.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_of_st._peter2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> There were false prophets also
  among the people, as also false teachers will be among you; they who will
  bring in a heresy of perdition, and denying (the) lord who bought them,
  bringing to themselves a quick perdition. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And many shall draw after their defilements; and
  through them (the) way of the truth shall be blasphemed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And in wrongdoings with feigned word they shall
  make trade of you: they whose judgement from (the) beginning is not done
  away, and their perdition will not slumber. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If God spared not the angels who sinned, but in
  bonds of gloom in the Tartaros gave them to be kept for (the) judgement and
  to be punished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the ancient world
  he spared not, but Nōe the eighth herald of [the] righteousness he kept, he
  brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and the cities also Sodoma and Gomorra he burnt,
  he condemned, and he set them for an example of the ungodly who will be;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and the righteous Lot he saved, being
  injured by their evil example of their defiling walk (of life); <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> for in [a] viewing and [a] hearing the righteous
  (man) was dwelling among them day by day, and they were paining a soul of a
  righteous (man) in lawless works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For
  the Lord knoweth (how) to save the godly from the temptations, But the unjust
  he shall keep for (the) day of (the) judgement to punish them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Much more those who walk after (the) flesh in
  defiling lusts and despising [the] dominion; daring [the] stubbornness, they
  tremble not before the glories, blaspheming; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> instead of which the angels being great in [a]
  might and [a] power bring not a blaspheming judgement against them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But these indeed (pron.) are like to
  speechless beasts, being natural (things) for (the) destruction and (the)
  extermination; blaspheming in these things which they know not, in their
  destruction they shall be destroyed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  and they shall receive (the) reward of their wrongdoing, making [the] delight
  which is in the day (a) pleasure, being as spot and for a stain, delighting
  in their deceits, and delighting with you, (they) being shepherds to
  them(selves); <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> having eyes full of
  adultery, and an unceasingness of (the) sin, bringing to themselves [a] quick
  perdition; there are many (who) will follow their sins. Deceiving souls which
  are not firm; having a heart exercised in [a] wrongdoing; being children of
  (the) curse; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> having left the straight
  road, they went astray, having walked in (the) road of Balaam he of Bosor, he
  who loved (the) reward of (the) iniquity; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> he received a reproof of his lawlessness, a
  speechless ass answered with a voice of man, she prevented (the) foolishness
  of the prophet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These are the
  fountains waterless, and mists driven along by a tempest; these for whom was
  kept (the) darkness of (the) blackness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Uttering [in] exalted vanities, being servants in
  evil lusts of (the) flesh (to) them who escaped a little, and they walked in
  an error; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> promising to them a
  freedom, being servants themselves of (the) corruption; for he by whom any
  one is conquered, he is servant to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For if having escaped from the defilement of the
  world into (the) knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, [but] they again are
  entangled among these, they will be conquered, and their last (states) will
  be worse for them than the first (states). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For it is good for them (if) they knew not (the)
  way of [the] righteousness, than having known it, that they should return
  from the holy commandment which was delivered to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For the proverb came true about them: 'A dog
  turned to his own vomit; and a sow (which) was washed, again rolled in her
  mire' (plur.).</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_of_st._peter3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My beloved, this now is (the)
  second epistle which I write to you; these in which I shall raise (up) your
  sincere heart <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to remember in a
  remembrance the words which the holy prophets said from (the) first, and the
  commandment of the apostles of our Lord and our saviour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But know this first, that in the last days mockers
  shall come walking according to their lusts, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and saying: Where was the promise of his coming?
  For since our fathers slept all these things remain thus since (the)
  beginning of the creation.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For they
  are ignorant of the thing. This (ignorance) is that which they also wish,
  (ignorance) that the heavens exist from (the) beginning, and (the) earth from
  [a] water and through [a] water stood by (the) word of God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> these (sc. waters) because of which the world of
  that time was submerged in [a] water and it perished; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but the present heavens and the earth in the same
  word are treasured up for (the) fire, being kept unto (the) day-of the
  judgement, and (the) perdition of the ungodly men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But of this be not forgetful, my beloved; that one
  day with the Lord (is) as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord will not delay about the
  promise, as some think that he will delay; but was a Lit.' thrown into.'
  longsuffering to you, not wishing that any should perish, but wishing that
  all should come to [a.] repentance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  But (the) day of the Lord shall come as a thief: this (day) through which the
  heavens will pass away violently: the elements will be burned, they will be
  dissolved; and (the) earth and the works which are in it shall be burned.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> All these things, then, being about
  to be dissolved, in what manner was it being meet that ye should walk in holy
  walks (of life) and godlinesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Gazing out in [an] haste forward to the day of the coming of the Lord, that
  through which the heavens will be burned and come to an end, and the elements
  will be burned and be dissolved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> New
  heavens and a new earth according to his promises we look out for; these in
  which the righteousness dwelleth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Therefore, my beloved, (since) we are gazing out forward to these, hasten
  yourselves to be found without spot with him, and without stain before him in
  [a] peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the longsuffering of
  the Lord reckon it to you for [a] salvation, according as also our beloved
  brother Paul, according to the wisdom which was given to him, wrote to you:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> as also in all his epistles, speaking
  in them concerning these (things); these in which some (things) are difficult
  to know (what they mean); these which the foolish and they who are not firm,
  distort as (the) rest of the Scriptures; who will draw themselves to their
  own perditions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Ye, then, my
  brethren, foreknowing, keep yourselves, lest by any means ye go astray in
  (the) error of the foolish, and fall from your own firmness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But grow in [the] grace and (the) knowledge of
  our Lord and our saviour Jesus Christ, whose is the glory from now and unto
  age of the ages. Amen.</p>
