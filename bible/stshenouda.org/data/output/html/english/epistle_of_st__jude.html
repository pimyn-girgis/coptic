  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Jude, (the) servant of Jesus
  Christ, but (the) brother of James, to them who were loved in God the Father,
  and they were kept for Jesus Christ, they who are called. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> May (the) mercy and (the) peace and the love be
  multiplied to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My beloved, all
  diligence (it is) which I give (lit. do them) writing to you concerning your
  salvation together. It was necessary for me to write to you to encourage
  (you), that ye should strive in the faith which was once delivered to you,
  namely the saints. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For men slipped
  themselves in among us, concerning whom it was before written unto this
  judgement, being ungodly, changing the grace of our Lord into [a] defilement,
  and denying (the) only Master, our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I wish you to know; though ye know all things,
  that once Jesus saved his people from (the) land of Khēmi; but (the) second
  time, them who believed not he destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Angels also (who) kept not their beginning, but
  they left their place of dwelling, he kept them in under (the) darkness in
  eternal bonds unto the judgement of the great day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> As Sodoma and Gomorra, and the other cities which
  were around them, having fornicated as these, and they went after other flesh
  (plur.), they are set for an example of the eternal fire, about to receive a
  judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thus also these others
  defile their flesh in (the) dreaming of dreams d, but reject [the] dominion;
  the glories they blaspheme. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But
  Michaēl the archangel, speaking (lit. saying) against the devil--he was
  speaking concerning (the) body of Moses--dared not to bring a blasphemous
  judgement upon him, but he said: 'The Lord shall rebuke thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But these blaspheme [in] the things indeed which
  they know not: but the things which they know naturally, as beasts without
  speech, in these they are corrupted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Woe to them because they walked on (the) road of Kain, and they rushed along
  (the) error of (the) reward of Balaam, and they perished in the contradiction
  of Kore. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> These are they who are spots
  in your love-feasts, delighting with you, being shepherds to themselves in
  fearlessness; they are clouds without water, and with (the) wind taking them
  and bringing them; they are fruitless trees of (the) autumn, having died
  twice, having been plucked up with their root; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> they are wild waves of the sea, foaming out a
  shame; they are stars astray, for whom is kept (the) darkness of (the)
  eternal blackness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But also against
  these prophesied the seventh from Adam, Enoch, saying: Lo, the Lord came in
  myriads of holy angels of his, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span>&nbsp;executing a judgement against all; and to
  reprove all the ungodly concerning all of their works of ungodliness in which
  they were ungodly, and concerning all the hard things which they spake
  against him, being ungodly sinners.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  These are the quarrelsome murmurers, walking according to their lusts, and
  their mouths speak in excess, admiring (men's) persons because of gain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But ye, my beloved, remember the
  words which were spoken from (the) first by the apostles of our Lord Jesus
  Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> that they were saying to you,
  that at (the) end of the times deceivers shall come, walking according to the
  lusts of their ungodlinesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> These
  are they who separate, psychic, in whom there is not spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But ye, my beloved, build yourselves in your holy
  faith, praying in the holy spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Let us keep ourselves in [a] love of God, looking out forward to the mercy of
  our Lord Jesus Christ unto an eternal life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Some indeed reproving, distinction being made
  about them; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but some saving,
  snatching them from a fire; But some having mercy upon in [a] fear, hating
  even the garment which is with spot from the flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But he for whom it is possible to keep you
  without stumbling, and to set you up before his' glory, being without spot in
  [a] gladness- <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> God alone our saviour,
  through Jesus Christ our Lord, the glory is his, and the greatness, and the
  strength, and the authority, before all the ages, and now and unto age of the
  ages, Amēn.</p>
