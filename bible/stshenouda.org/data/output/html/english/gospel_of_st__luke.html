  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Since many took in hand (lit. threw
  their hand) to write words concerning the things which were fulfilled among
  us, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> according as the first (men), who
  saw (them) and became ministers of the word, delivered to us, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> it was pleasing to me also, having traced
  everything accurately (lit. in certainty), so to write to thee, most
  excellent Theophilus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that thou
  mightest know the certainty of the words in which thou wast instructed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> It came to pass in the days of Herod
  (the) king of Judea, (that) there was a priest, his name being Zacharias, of
  the ministry-days of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and
  her name was (lit. is) Elisabet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and the
  ordinances of the Lord, being blameless. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they had no son, because Elisabet was barren,
  and they both had grown (old) in their days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it came to pass (that in) doing his
  priestly-office in the order of his ministry-days before God, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> according to the custom of the priestly-office his
  lot was to offer up incense. And he went into the temple of the Lord:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and all the multitude of the people
  were praying outside at (the) hour of the incense. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And an angel of the Lord appeared to him,
  standing on the right hand of the altar of the incense. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Zacharias having seen, was troubled, and fear
  came upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the angel said to
  him: Fear not, Zacharias: because thy prayer was heard, and thy wife Elisabet
  shall bear thee a son. And thou shalt call his name "John." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And joy shall be to thee, and gladness; and many
  shall rejoice over his birth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For he
  will be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he shall not drink;
  and he will be filled with the (lit. a) Holy Spirit from (the time of) being
  in (the) womb of his mother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he
  shall make many of (the) sons of Israel return to the Lord their God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he will be first to come before
  in front of him in the (lit. a) spirit and power of Elias, to turn (the)
  heart of fathers to their sons, and them who are disobedient to (lit. in) the
  wisdom of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people which was
  justified.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Zacharias said to the
  angel By (lit. in) what shall (lit. will) I know this? for I am an old man,
  and my wife grew (old) in her days.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And the angel answered, he said to him: I am Gabriel, he who standeth before
  God; and I was sent to speak to thee, and to preach to thee these glad
  tidings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And lo, thou shalt be
  holding thy peace, and it is not possible for thee to speak, until the day in
  which these (things) will be done, because that thou believedst not my
  words--these which will be fulfilled in their time.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And all the people were looking for Zacharias,
  and were wondering because that he delayed within the temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And having come out, he was not able to speak to
  them: and they knew that he saw a vision within the temple: and he was
  beckoning to them, and remained dumb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And it came to pass, (that) his ministry-days having been completed, he went
  to his house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And after those days
  Elisabet his wife conceived; and she was hiding herself five months, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus the Lord did to me in the days
  in which he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among the men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Now in the sixth month Gabriel the
  angel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, its name being Nazareth,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> to a virgin who was betrothed to a
  man, his name being Joseph, of (the) house of David; and (the) name of the
  virgin is Mariam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And having gone in
  unto her, he said to her: Hail, thou (lit. she) who art full of grace, the
  Lord (is) with thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But she was
  troubled at this word, and was reasoning what kind is this salutation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the angel said to her: Fear not,
  Mariam, for thou foundest grace before God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And lo, thou wilt conceive, and bear a son, and
  shalt call his name "Jesus." <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> He (lit.
  this) shall be great, and he shall be called "(the) Son of the Highest" (lit.
  that, or him who is high): and the Lord God shall give to him (the) throne of
  David his father: <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> and he will be king
  over (the) house of Jacob for ever; and there shall not be (an) end of his
  kingdom.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Mariam said to the
  angel: 'How will this be to me, since I know not (a) husband?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the angel answered, he said to her: The (lit.
  a) Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the (lit. a) power of the Highest (as
  before) will overshadow thee: therefore he (or that) who will be born is
  holy; he shall be called "(the) Son of God." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And behold, Elisabet, thy kinswoman, also
  conceived a son in her old age: and this is her sixth month--she who is
  called "the barren." <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Because there is
  not any word impossible with God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  And Mariam said: a Lo, the handmaid of the Lord; it shall be to me according
  to thy word.' And the angel went from her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Mariam rose in those days, she went in haste
  to the hill-country to a city of Juda; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and she entered (the) house of Zacharias, and
  saluted Elisabet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And it came to pass
  (that) Elisabet having heard the salutation of Mariam, the babe moved in her
  womb. And Elisabet was filled with the (lit. a) Holy Spirit; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> and she cried out (lit. up) with a loud voice,
  and said: a Blessed art thou among the women, and blessed is (the) fruit of
  thy womb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Whence is this to me, that
  (the) mother of my Lord should come to me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> For lo, as soon as (the) voice of thy salutation
  was in mine ears, the babe moved for gladness in my womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And blessed is she who believed; because there
  will be (the) fulfilment of the things which were spoken to her by the Lord.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Mariam said: My soul exalted the
  Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> and my spirit was glad over God
  my Saviour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Because he looked down
  upon (the) humbleness of his handmaid: for lo, henceforth all generations
  will call me blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Because he who
  is strong did to me great things (lit. greatnesses); and his name is holy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And his pity is unto generations and
  generations for them who fear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> He
  made strength in his arm; be scattered the proud in (the) thought of their
  heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> He hurled strong (ones) from
  thrones, and he exalted them who are humble. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Them who were hungry he satisfied with good, and
  them who were rich he sent away empty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> He helped Israel his child, to remember his pity,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> according as he spake to our fathers,
  Abraham and his seed for ever.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And
  Mariam was with her three months, and returned to her house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> Now the time was completed to Elisabet for her
  bearing; and she bare a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And they
  who were around her house, and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord magnified his
  pity for (lit. with) her; and they were rejoicing with her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And it came to pass on the eighth day, (that)
  they came that they might circumcise the child; and they were calling him by
  (lit. to the) name of his father Zacharias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And his mother answered, she said: Nay; but call
  his name "John."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And they said to
  her: There is not any among thy kindred who is called by this name.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And they beckoned to his father: What
  wishedst thou to call him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And having
  asked for a tablet, he wrote, saying: John is his name.' And they wondered
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> And his mouth opened suddenly,
  and his tongue; and he was speaking, blessing God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And fear was upon all who were around them: and
  they were speaking all these (things) on the hill-country of Juda.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And they who heard were all reasoning
  in their heart, saying: What then will be to this child? ' For (the) hand of
  the Lord was (imperf.) with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> And
  Zacharias his father was filled with the (lit. a) Holy Spirit, and he
  prophesied, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> Blessed is the
  Lord God of Israel; because he visited and made redemption for his people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> And he raised up a horn of salvation
  for us in (the) house of David his child, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(70)</span> according as he spake from the mouths of his holy
  prophets since (the) age, <span style="color:#b00e23">(71)</span> salvation
  from our enemies and from (the) hands of all who hate us, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(72)</span> to shew (lit. do) pity for (lit. with) our
  fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(73)</span> the oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(74)</span> for the giving to us, without fear,
  having been saved from (the) hands of our enemies, to serve him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(75)</span> in holiness and righteousness before him all our
  days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(76)</span> And thou indeed, Child, shalt
  be called "The prophet of the Highest;" for thou wilt be first in walking
  before the Lord to prepare his roads; <span style="color:#b00e23">(77)</span>
  to give knowledge of (the) salvation to his people in forgiveness of sins,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(78)</span> because of the compassions of (the)
  pity of our God, [in] these in which he is to visit us as a dayspring from
  (the) height, <span style="color:#b00e23">(79)</span> to give light to them
  who sit in (the) darkness and (the) shadow of (the) death; for (the)
  directing our feet to (the) road of the peace.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(80)</span> And the child grew, and was being strengthened in
  the Spirit, and was (imperf.) in the deserts unto the day of his appearing
  unto Israel.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> It came to pass in those days
  (that) a decree came forth from (the) king Augustus that all the world should
  give in its name to be written. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> This
  is the first enrolment which was made, Kyrinnios being governor of Syria.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And all were going to write their name
  each one at his city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Joseph also
  came up from Galilee from a city Nazareth' into a city of David called
  Bethlehem, because that he is from (the) house and family of David;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> to write his name with Mariam, who was
  betrothed to him, being with child. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And it came to pass (that), they being there, her days were completed for her
  bearing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And she bare her son the
  firstborn; and she wrapped him, she laid him in a manger, because they had
  not place in the place of lodging. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  there were shepherds feeding in that country in (the) field, and watching in
  the watches of the night over their flock of sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And lo, an angel of the Lord stood over them, and
  the (lit. a) glory of the Lord gave light to them, and they feared with a
  very great fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the angel said
  to them: Fear not; for lo, I preach glad tidings to you of great joy, which
  (lit. this which) will be to all the people: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> because there was born for you to-day a Saviour,
  which is Christ the Lord, in (the) city of David. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And this is the sign to you; ye shall find a
  child wrapped, and lying in a manger.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there was suddenly a multitude of (an) host
  of (the) heaven with the angel praising God, and saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Glory to God in the highest, and peace upon the
  earth and good pleasure among [the] men.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to pass (that), the angels having
  gone to (the) heaven from them, the shepherds spake to one another, saying:
  Let us go unto Bethlehem and see concerning this word which came--this which
  the Lord shewed to us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they came
  hasting, they found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having seen, they knew concerning
  the word which was spoken to them concerning the child. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And all who heard wondered at the things which
  the shepherds spake to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But
  Mary--she was keeping all these words, meditating in her heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and
  praising God over all things which they heard and the things which they saw,
  according as was spoken to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  eight days having been completed that they might circumcise him, his name was
  called Jesus,' which the angel called him from (the time) before he was
  conceived in (the) womb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the days
  having been completed for the cleansing according to the law of Moses, they
  brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> according as it is written in the law of the
  Lord: that every male which will open (the) womb of his mother shall be
  called holy to the Lord;' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and to give
  a sacrifice according as was said in (the) law of the Lord: ' A pair of
  turtledoves or two young pigeons.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, his name being Simon; and this man
  was righteous, devout, looking for (the) consolation of Israel: and there was
  (the) Holy Spirit [put] upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  they were shewing to him in a revealing by the Holy Spirit, that he should
  not see (the) death, before he saw Christ the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he came in the Spirit up to the temple, and
  as (lit. in) his parents (were) bringing the child Jesus in, to do for him
  according to that which was required by the law, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Simon took him up on his arms, and blessed God,
  saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Now, my Lord, thou wilt send
  thy servant away in peace, according to thy word; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> because mine eyes saw thy salvation, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> which thou preparedst before all the peoples:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> a light for revelation to (lit. of)
  Gentiles, and a glory of thy people Israel.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And his father and his mother wondered at the
  things which are said concerning him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  And Simon blessed them, and said to Mary (the) mother of the child: 'Lo, this
  (child) is set for a fall and a rising of many in Israel, and a sign which is
  opposed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And thou thyself--a sword
  shall pass (through) thy soul, that thoughts may be revealed from many
  hearts.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And (there) was (imperf.)
  Anna the prophetess, (the) daughter of Phanuel from (the) tribe of Asser--she
  (lit. this) had grown (old) of many days, she was living with (a) husband
  seven years from her virginity, <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and
  she (lit. this) had been a widow unto eighty-four years--who was not passing
  not away from the temple, in fastings and prayers ministering night and day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And at that hour she came before him,
  she thanked God, and she was speaking concerning him with all who looked for
  a redemption of Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having
  finished everything according to (the) law of the Lord, they returned to
  Galilee, to their city Nazareth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And
  the child had grown, and was being strengthened, being full of wisdom, and
  grace of God was (imperf) upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span>
  And his parents used to go (year) by year to Jerusalem to the feast of the
  Passover. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he having become twelve
  years old, they went to the feast according to the custom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And the days having been finished, as (lit. in)
  they (were) returning, the child Jesus was left behind them in Jerusalem; and
  his parents knew not; <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> but thinking
  that he was walking with them who walked on the road, they went on (lit.
  came) a day of walking. And they were seeking for him among their kinsfolk
  and them whom they knew. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And having
  not found him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And it came to pass after three days (that) they
  found him in the temple, sitting in (the) midst of the teachers, hearing them
  and asking them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And they who heard
  him were (imperf.) all amazed at the knowledge and his answering them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And having seen him, they wondered:
  and his mother said to him: 'My son, what is this which thou didst to us
  thus? behold thy father and I were grieving, seeking for thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And he said to them; Wherefore seek ye for me?
  were ye not knowing that I must be in the things of my Father?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And they understood not his word which he said to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And he came down with them to
  Nazareth, and was (imperf.) subject to them: but his mother was keeping all
  these words in her heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And Jesus
  was advancing in [the] stature and [the] wisdom, and [the] grace with God and
  the men.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now in (the) fifteenth year of
  (the) government of Tiberius (the) king, Pontius Pilate being governor of
  Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother being
  tetrarch of Hidurea and the Tetragonites country, and Lisanios being tetrarch
  of Abiline, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> in the time of Anna and
  Kaiapha the chief priests, came the (lit. a) word of God upon John (the) son
  of Zacharias in (the) desert. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he
  came to all the region round about the Jordan preaching baptism of repentance
  for (the) forgiveness of sin; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> as it
  was written in (the) book of the words of Esaias the prophet: (The) voice of
  him who crieth out in (the) desert: Prepare (the) road of the Lord, make
  straight his paths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Every valley shall
  be filled, and every mountain and every hill shall be humiliated, and the
  (places) which are crooked shall become straight, and the (places) which are
  hard, smooth roads; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and all flesh
  shall see the Saviour of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He was
  saying then to the multitudes who came forth to him to be baptised by him:
  Offspring of the vipers, who told you to flee from the anger which cometh?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Send fruit then forth worthy of the
  repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, that (as) our father we have
  Abraam. I say to you, that it is possible for God to raise up sons to Abraam
  from these stones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And now the axe is
  laid at (the) root of the trees, and every tree which will not bring forth
  good fruit will be cut down, and cast to the fire.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the multitudes were asking him, saying: What
  shall (lit. will) we do?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he
  answered them: He who hath two coats let him give to him who hath not; and he
  who hath victuals let him do likewise' (lit. again thus). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And there came, again, publicans also that they
  might be baptised, and they said to him: Teacher, what shall (lit. will) we
  do?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to them: Do not
  anything beyond that which is appointed to you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And soldiers also were asking him, saying: What
  shall (lit. will) we also do?' And he said to them: Do not assault any one,
  nor take anything by violence; and let your wages suffice you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And (as) all the people are (lit. is) looking,
  and all (are) reasoning in their heart concerning John, lest haply he is
  Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> John answered them all,
  saying: I indeed baptise you with water; but the stronger than I cometh, (of)
  whom I am not worthy to unloose a latchet of his shoe, he shall baptise you
  with the (lit. a) Holy Spirit and fire: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> whose fan of winnowing (lit. removing) (is) in
  his hand to cleanse his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner, but he
  will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> (With) many (things) indeed then, and other
  (things) encouraging them, he was preaching good tidings to the people;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> but Herod the tetrarch, John
  reproving him concerning Herodias (the) wife of Philip his brother, and
  concerning all things which Herod did, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> added this also to them all, he threw John into
  the prison. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it came to pass
  (that) all the people having been baptised, and Jesus also having been
  baptised and praying, (the) heaven opened, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in (the)
  form of a body as a dove, and there was a voice from (the) heaven: 'Thou art
  my Son, my beloved in whom I was well pleased.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus began to be in (the) thirtieth year, as
  he is thought (the) son of Joseph, [the] of Eli, <span style=

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jesus being full of the Holy
  Spirit returned from the Jordan, and the Spirit took him away to (the)
  desert, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for forty days the devil
  tempting him. And he ate not anything in those days: and they having been
  finished, he hungered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the devil
  said to him: 'If thou art (the) Son of God, command this stone that it may
  become bread.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus answered him
  It is written that the man was not to live by (lit. to) bread alone.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having taken him away aloft, he
  shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the devil said to him: 'I will give to thee
  all this authority, and their glory, because to me it is delivered; and to
  him whom I wish I give it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> If thou
  then shouldest worship before me, all shall be thine.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to him: 'It is
  written, that the Lord thy God thou shalt worship, and him alone thou shalt
  serve.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he brought him, again, up
  to Jerusalem, and made him stand upon (the) wing of the temple, and said to
  him: If thou art (the) Son of God, throw thyself down from here (lit. this):
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for it is written, that he shall
  order his angels concerning thee, that they keep thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and lift thee upon their arms, lest haply thou
  dash thy foot against (a) stone.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  Jesus answered, he said to him: It was said, that thou shalt not tempt the
  Lord thy God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the devil having
  finished all the temptation, went from him for (lit. unto) a time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jesus returned into Galilee in
  the power of the Spirit: and a fame came forth in all the region round about
  concerning him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he was teaching
  in their synagogues, all glorifying him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he came to Nazareth, the place in which he
  was brought up: and he went into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths,
  according to the custom, and rose to read. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having opened the book, he found the place in
  which it was (imperf.) written: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The
  (lit. a) Spirit of the Lord is upon me; therefore he anointed me, he sent me
  to preach good tidings to the poor, to proclaim to the captives release, and
  sight to the blind; to send to them who are bound, for (lit. in) release,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> to proclaim the (lit an) acceptable
  year of the Lord.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having rolled
  the book, he gave it to the officer, he sat, and all who were in the
  synagogue--their eyes were looking upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he began to say to them: This scripture was
  fulfilled to-day in your ears.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And
  they were all bearing witness to him, and were wondering at the words of
  [the] grace, which were coming from his mouth. And they were saying: Is not
  this (the) son of Joseph?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  said to them: Ye will altogether say this parable to me: "Physician, heal
  thine own self:" the things which we heard of having been done in Kapharnaum,
  do here also in thy city.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he
  said to them: Verily I say to you, that there is not any prophet acceptable
  in his city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And truly I say to you,
  that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias, when (the) heaven
  was shut for three years and six months, so that there was a great famine
  upon all (the) earth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and Elias was
  not sent to any of them, except to a widow woman, who was in Sarepta of
  Sidonia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And there were many lepers
  in Israel in the time of Eliseos the prophet: and not any of them were
  cleansed, except Neman the Syrian.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  And they were all filled with anger, hearing these (things), <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and they rose, they thrust (lit. threw) him
  outside of the city, and they brought him forth upon (the) height of the
  mountain upon which their city was (imperf.) set, so that they might cast him
  down headlong. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But he having passed
  through their midst, was walking (away). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he came down to Kapharnaum, a city of
  Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbaths: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> and they were (imperf.) amazed at his teaching;
  because his word was (imperf.) with authority. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And there was a man in the synagogue, having
  (lit. being) an unclean spirit with him, and he cried out (lit. up) with a
  great cry: <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> What (hast) thou with us,
  Jesus the Nazarene? camest thou to destroy us? I know thee who thou (art),
  the Holy (one) of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Jesus
  rebuked him, saying: Be silenced, and come out of him.' And the demon having
  cast him down in (lit. to the) midst, came out of him, he gave not any pain
  to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And a great fear came upon
  them all, and they were speaking to one another, saying: What is this word?
  because with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, they come
  out.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And there was a fame spread
  abroad concerning him in all places of the region round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he rose from the synagogue, he went into
  (the) house of Simon. And (the) mother-in-law of Simon--there was a great
  fever with her, and they were beseeching him for her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he stood above her, he rebuked the fever, and
  it left her: and immediately she rose and ministered to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And (the) sun having set, all who have sick folk
  in sicknesses of many kinds (are) bringing them to him. And he having laid
  hand on each of them, healed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span>
  And demons also were coming out from many, crying out, saying: Thou art (the)
  Son of God.' And he was rebuking them; he permits them not to speak, because
  they were knowing him, that he is Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And the day having come, he came forth, he went
  to a desert place: and the multitudes were seeking for him, and they came to
  him, and were laying hold on him, that he should not go from them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But he said to them: 'I must preach
  in the other cities good tidings of the kingdom of God, because therefore was
  I sent.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And he was preaching in the
  synagogues of Judea.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass, the multitudes
  having gathered upon him and to hear the word of God, that he was standing by
  the lake of Gennezareth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and he saw
  two ships moored by the lake: but the fishermen, having come up in them, were
  washing their nets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He betook himself
  to one of the ships, being Simon's, he told him to move out from the shore a
  little. And having sat, he was teaching the multitudes from the ship.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And having ended speaking, he said to
  Simon: 'Come out to the deep, and let your nets down for a draught.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Simon answered, he said: 'Teacher,
  all the night we toiled, we caught not, but at (lit. in) thy word we will let
  the nets down.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And having done this,
  they gathered a great multitude of fish, and the nets were going to rend.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they beckoned to their friends,
  who were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they
  came, they filled the two ships, so that they began to sink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Simon Peter having seen, threw himself at
  (the) feet of Jesus, saying: 'Go from me, my Lord, because I (am) a sinful
  man.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For fear seized him, and all who
  were with him, at (the) draught of the fish which they caught: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and likewise (lit. thus again) James also and
  John, the sons of Zebedee, who were (imperf.) friends to Simon. Jesus said to
  Simon: Fear not, for henceforth thou shalt be a fisherman catcher of men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And having drawn the nets to the
  shore, they left everything, they followed' him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it came to pass, that (lit. and) they having
  come into one of the cities, lo, a man full of leprosy. And having seen
  Jesus, he threw himself upon his face beseeching him, saying: 'My Lord, if
  thou shouldest wish, it is possible for thee to cleanse me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he stretched out his hand, he touched him,
  saying: 'I wish, be cleansed.' And immediately the leprosy went from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he ordered him, saying: Tell not
  any one, but go shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing
  according as Moses commanded, for a witness to them.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the report (lit. word) concerning him spread
  abroad the more: and great multitudes gathered to hear him, and (for him) to
  heal them in their sicknesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he
  used to go to the desert places and pray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to pass on one of the days, that
  (lit. and) he was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were
  sitting, having come from all Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the
  (lit. a) power of the Lord was (present) for (the) curing them, is
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And behold, men brought one,
  paralysed upon a bed: and they were seeking to bring him in, and to lay him
  before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having not found the
  way of bringing him in because of the multitude, they went up on the
  housetop, they let him down with the bed through the tiling in (the) midst
  before Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having seen their
  faith, he said to the paralysed: 'Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees
  began to reason, saying: 'Who is this who speaketh this blasphemy? For whom
  is it possible to forgive sin, except the one alone--God?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Jesus having known their reasonings answered,
  he said to them: Wherefore reason ye in your hearts? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> What is easy to say: Thy sins are forgiven thee,"
  or to say: "Rise and walk?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> That ye
  may know that (the) Son of (the) man hath authority upon the earth to forgive
  sin'--then (lit. and) he said to the paralysed--'to thee I say: "Rise, take
  up thy bed, and go to thy house."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And immediately he rose before them, he took up that upon which he lay (lit.
  was sleeping), he went to his house, glorifying God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And amazement took all, and they were glorifying
  God, and they were filled with fear, saying: We saw wonders to-day.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And after these (things) he came out,
  and he saw a publican, his name being Levi, sitting at a custom-house, and he
  said to him: Walk after me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he
  left everything, he rose, he walked after him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Levi made a great feast for him within his
  house: and there was a great multitude of the publicans and others
  sitting-at-meat with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the
  Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring against his disciples, saying:
  'Wherefore do ye eat and drink with the publicans and the sinners?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to them:
  They who are strong have not need of the physician, but they who are
  diseased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For I came not to invite
  the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they said to him: The disciples of John make
  many fastings and prayers, likewise (lit. thus again) those of the Pharisees,
  but thy disciples--they eat, they drink.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus said to them: 'Is it possible for you
  to make (the) sons of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom (is) with
  them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But days come when the
  bridegroom should be taken away from them, then shall they fast in those
  days.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he was speaking (lit.
  saying) a parable to them: No one rendeth a piece of cloth from a new garment
  and putteth (lit. throweth) it to an old garment; otherwise it rendeth the
  new also, and the piece which was taken away from the new agreeth not with
  the old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Nor doth any one put (lit.
  throw) new wine into old bottles; otherwise the new wine rendeth the bottles,
  and it (lit. he) is poured out, and the bottles perish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But they put new wine into new bottles.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And no one drinking old (wine) will
  wish (for) new: for he saith: "The old is sweet."'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass, (that) he
  passed on the sabbaths through the cornfields, and his disciples were
  plucking the ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands and eating them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But some of the Pharisees said:
  Wherefore do ye that which is not right to do on the sabbaths?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to them: Did ye not
  read even this, that which David did, when he hungered, and they who were
  with him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> how he went into (the) house
  of God, and the loaves of the Prothesis--he took them, he ate them, and he
  gave to them also who were with him, which it was not lawful for them to eat
  except (for) the priests alone?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  he was saying to them: The Lord of the sabbath is (the) Son of (the) man.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it came to pass on the sabbath
  also, (that) he went into their synagogue and taught: and there was a man
  there whose right hand was (lit. is) withered. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The scribes and the Pharisees were considering
  him, whether he will heal on (the) sabbath, that they might find accusation
  against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But he was knowing their
  reasonings, he said to the man whose hand was (imperf.) withered: `Rise,
  stand in (the) midst;' and he rose, he stood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Jesus said to them: 'I ask you, whether it is
  lawful to do good on the sabbaths, or to do evil? to save life (lit. a soul),
  or to destroy it'? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And having looked
  upon them all, he said to the man: Stretch out thy hand.' And he stretched it
  out; and his hand was cured. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they
  were filled with madness; and were speaking to one another what they will do
  to Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it came to pass in
  those days, (that) he came forth upon the mountain to pray; and he was
  keeping watch in [the] prayer to (lit. of) God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the day having come, he called his disciples:
  and he chose from them twelve, whom he named Apostles;' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Simon whom they call Peter,' and Andrew his
  brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and Matthew, and Thomas, and James (the son) of
  Alphaeus, and Simon whom they call the Zealot,' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and Judas of James, and Judas (the) Iscariot.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And having come down with them, he
  stood in a level place, and a multitude of his disciples, and also a great
  multitude of the people from all Judea, and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast
  (of) Tyre and Sidon, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> who came to hear
  him, and that he might cure them from their sicknesses; and them whom the
  unclean spirits were afflicting he healed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the whole multitude was seeking to touch him;
  because power was coining out of him, and he was curing them all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he, having lifted up his eyes to
  his disciples, was saying: Blessed are ye the poor: because yours is the
  kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Blessed are ye who
  are hungry now: because ye will be satisfied. Blessed are ye who weep now:
  because ye will laugh (lit. mock). <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Blessed are ye, if the men hate you, and separate you, and revile you, and
  cast out your name as evil because of (the) Son of (the) man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Rejoice in that day, and be glad: for lo, your
  reward is great in (the) heaven, for these (things) their fathers were doing
  to the prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But woe to you of
  the rich: because ye have already received your comfort. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Woe to you of them who are satisfied now: because
  ye will hunger. Woe to you of them who laugh (lit. mock) now: because ye will
  mourn and ye will weep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Woe to you,
  if all the men should say of you "well:" for their fathers were doing these
  (things) likewise (lit. again thus) to the false prophets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But I say to you of them who hear, "Love your
  enemies, do good to them who hate you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Bless them who curse you. Pray for them who
  persecute you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> To him who will strike
  this cheek offer the other: and him who will take away thy garment forbid not
  to take away thy coat also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And give
  to every one who will ask of thee; and of him who will take away the things
  which are thine, want them not (again). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And according as ye wish that the men should do
  to you, do ye also to them thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  if ye are to love them who love you, what are your thanks (sing.)? for the
  sinners also loved them who love them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And if ye are to do good to them who do good with
  you, what are your thanks (sing)? the sinners also do thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And if ye should lend to .some, hoping to receive
  of them, what are your thanks (sing.)? the sinners also themselves lend to
  sinners, that they may receive of them their exchange. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But love your enemies, and do good to them, and
  give, and hope not for anything again; and your reward will be great, and ye
  will be sons of the Highest: because he is kind to the unthankful and the
  evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Be ye pitiful, as your Father
  (is) being pitiful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Judge (lit. give
  judgement) not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn (lit. throw judgement)
  not, and ye will not be condemned. Forgive, and be forgiven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Give, and be given; a good measure full, shaken,
  running over they will give into your bosom. For with the measure with which
  ye will measure, it is to be measured to you." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he spake (lit. said) also a parable to them:
  'Is it possible for a blind man to guide a blind man? will they not both fall
  into a ditch? <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Is there a disciple
  greater than his teacher? But let every one, being prepared, be as his
  teacher. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Wherefore then seest thou
  the mote in (the) eye of thy brother, but the beam which is in thine eye thou
  considerest not? <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Or how is it
  possible for thee to say to thy brother: "My brother, let me cast the mote
  from thine eye," and thou thyself seest not the beam which is in thine eye?
  Hypocrite, cast the beam from thine eye first, and then thou shalt see
  clearly to cast the mote from (the) eye of thy brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> For there is not a good tree producing an evil
  fruit; again, there is not an evil tree producing a good fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> For each of the trees they know from its fruit.
  For they gather not figs from thorns, and cut not grapes off' a bramble-bush.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> The good man from the good treasure
  of his heart bringeth forth the good; and the evil (man) from the treasure,
  which is evil, bringeth forth that which is evil: from (the) abundance of
  (the) heart the mouth speaketh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And
  wherefore call ye me "Lord, Lord," and do not the things which I say?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Every one who will come to me, and
  hear my words, and do them, I will show you to whom he was likened:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> he was likened to a man building a
  house, who hewed out, and dug down, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and
  great rains having come, the river struck in at that house, and it could not
  move it, because that it was (imperf.) built well. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> But he who will hear my words, and do them not,
  he was likened to a man who built a house upon the earth without foundation;
  into which the river struck, and immediately it fell, and (the) fall of that
  house became great.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having quite finished all his
  words in (the) ears of the people, he came into Kapharnaum. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And a centurion's servant (lit. a centurion his
  servant), who was (imperf.) precious to him, being diseased, was going to
  die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And having heard concerning
  Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come
  and cure his servant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they, having
  come to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy for whom thou
  wilt do this: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for he loveth our
  nation; and himself built for us the synagogue.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Jesus was walking with them. And now he being
  not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him:
  Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come in
  under (the) roof of my house: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  therefore neither thought (lit. made) I myself worthy to come unto thee: but
  say with (the) word, and my servant (lit. child) will be cured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For I also am a man ranked under authority, having
  (lit. being) soldiers under me: and I say to this (one), "Go," he goeth; and
  another, "Come," and he cometh; and my servant, "Do this," and he doeth it.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Jesus having heard these (things)
  wondered at him, and having turned himself, he said: 'I say to you that
  neither in all Israel found I [not] faith of this degree.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they who were sent, having returned to the
  house, found the servant cured. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  it came to pass on the (lit. his) morrow, (that) he went to a city called
  'Nain;' and his disciples were walking with him, and a great multitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Now when he approached to the gate of
  the city, lo, they were taking one away dead, being the (lit. a) only son of
  his mother, and she (lit. this) was a widow: and there was a great multitude
  of the city with her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Jesus,
  having seen her, had compassion upon her, and said to her: Weep not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he came, he touched the bier: and
  they who carried stood. And he said: Young man, to thee I say, Rise.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the dead sat, and began to speak.
  And he gave him to his mother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  fear took all: and they were glorifying God, saying that a great prophet rose
  among us: and, that God visited his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the report (lit. word) came forth concerning
  him in all Judea, and all the region round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And his disciples told John concerning all these
  (things). And having called two of his disciples, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> he sent them to the Lord, saying: (Art) thou he
  who cometh, or look we for another? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  And the men, having come to him, said: 'John the Baptist sent us to thee,
  saying: "Art thou he who cometh, or look we for another?"' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> In that hour he healed many from sicknesses and
  plagues and evil spirits; and to many blind he granted [the] sight.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he answered, he said to them:
  'Go, tell John the things which ye see, and which ye heard; the blind see,
  the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise, the
  poor have good tidings preached to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And blessed is he, who will not be offended in
  me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the messengers of John
  having gone, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: 'What came ye
  out to (the) desert to see? a reed shaken by a wind? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But what came ye out to see? a man who is clothed
  with soft raiment (plur.)? Behold, those with the garments of (the) glory and
  (the) delight are in (the) house of the kings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But what came ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I
  say to you, more than a prophet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> This
  is he concerning whom it is written: "Lo, I will send (the) messenger before
  thy face, who will prepare thy road in front of thee." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> I say to you, that among (the) offspring of [the]
  women there is not any greater than John: but the lesser than he in the
  kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And all the people and the publicans justified
  God, having been baptised with the baptism of John. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the
  counsel of God in themselves. they were not baptised by him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> To what am I to liken myself for the men of this
  generation, and to what are they like? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> They are like to children who sit in a
  marketplace, and calling to one another, saying: "We sang to you, and ye
  danced not: we mourned, and ye wept not." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> For John the Baptist came eating not bread, and
  he drinketh not wine, and ye say, that there is a demon with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And (the) Son of (the) man came
  eating and drinking; and ye say: "Behold, a man gluttonous and winebibber,
  being friend to the publicans and the sinners!" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And [the] wisdom was justified from all her
  sons.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> One of the Pharisees was
  beseeching him that he would eat with him. And having entered (the) house of
  the Pharisee, he sat down to meat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  And behold, a woman--she was (imperf.) (a) sinner in the city; and having
  known that he sits at meat in (the) house of the Pharisee, she took an
  alabaster-box of ointment, <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> and having
  stood behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears,
  and wiped them with the hair of her head, and was kissing his feet, anointing
  them with the ointment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And the
  Pharisee who invited him, having seen, said in himself, saying: If this (man)
  were a prophet, he would have known what [is] and of what sort is this woman
  who touched him, that she is a sinner.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to him: Simon, I have
  a word to say to thee.' And he said: Teacher, say it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he said: There were two debtors having one
  (lit. a) creditor. The one owed five hundred staters, and the other owed
  fifty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And they had not (enough) to
  pay; he forgave them both frankly. Which then of them will love him the
  more?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Simon answered, he said: I
  think, he to whom he forgave frankly the most.' And he said: 'Thou judgedst
  rightly.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And having turned to the
  woman, he said to Simon: Thou seest this woman. I came into thy house. thou
  gavest not water for my feet: but this (one), she wetted my feet with her
  tears, and wiped them with her hairs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  Thou kissedst not my mouth: but this (one), she, from (the time) I came in,
  ceased not to kiss my feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Thou
  anointedst not my head with oil: but this (one), she anointed my feet with
  ointment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Therefore I say to thee,
  that her sins which are great are forgiven her, because she loved greatly.
  For to whom they forgive little, he loveth little.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And they who sat at meat began to say
  in themselves: Who is this who gives (lit. makes) (the) forgiveness of sin
  also?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And he said to the woman: 'Go
  in peace, thy faith saved thee.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after these
  things, that (lit. and) he was walking by city and village, proclaiming and
  preaching good tidings of the kingdom of God, and the twelve being with him,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and women also whom he healed from
  evil spirits and sicknesses, Mary who is called The Magdalene,' from whom he
  cast the seven demons, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and Joanna
  (the) wife of Chuza the steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many others, who
  were ministering to him from their possessions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And a great multitude being assembled, with them
  who were coming to him (from) every city, he spake (lit. said) by a parable.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The sower came forth to sow his seed:
  and in his sowing, some (lit. one) indeed fell by the road; and it was
  crushed, and the birds of (the) heaven ate it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And another fell upon a rock, and grew up, it
  withered, because that it had not moisture. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And another fell in (the) midst of the thorns; and
  the thorns, having grown up with it, choked it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And other fell upon the good earth, and having
  grown up, brought forth fruit an hundredfold.' Having said (lit. saying)
  these (things), he was calling: 'Who path an ear to hear, let him hear.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And his disciples were asking him:
  What is this parable?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he said to
  them: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but (to
  the) rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not
  hear, and may not understand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Now the
  parable is this. The seed is the word of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they who are by the road are they who hear:
  then the devil cometh, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they
  may not believe and be saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  they who are upon the rock are they (who), when they should hear, receive the
  word to them with joy; and these have not root, who believe for a time, and
  in (the) time of temptation they cease. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And that which fell in the thorns, these are they
  who hear, and the cares and the riches and the pleasures of this life, in
  which they walk (lit. walking in them), choke them, and they bring not forth
  fruit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And that which fell in the
  good ground, these are they who having heard the word in an honest and good
  heart (are) laying hold on it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> No one lighteth a lamp and covereth
  it with a vessel or setteth it underneath a bed; but setteth it upon a
  lampstand, that they who will come in may see the light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For there is not that which is hidden, that it
  will not appear; neither is there that which is secret, that it will not be
  known, and come into (the) midst. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Take heed then in what manner ye heard: for to him who hath shall be given;
  and from him who hath not, even that (lit. the one also) which he thinketh
  that he hath shall be taken away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> His
  mother came to him, and his brothers, and they were not able to meet with him
  because of the multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they
  told him: 'Lo, thy mother and thy brothers stand outside, wishing to see
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he answered, he said to
  them: My mother and my brothers are these, who hear the word of God, and who
  do it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it came to pass on one of
  the days, (that) he entered into a ship, himself and his disciples, and he
  said to them: Let us go across the lake.' And they launched (lit. drew)
  forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But (as they are) sailing, he
  (is) sleeping: and a great wind came down to the lake, and it was
  overwhelming them, and they were (imperf.) in danger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having come, they woke him, saying: Teacher,
  we shall (lit. will) perish.' And he having risen, rebuked the wind and the
  waves of the waters, and they ceased, and there was a great calm.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he said to them: Where was your
  faith?' But they having feared wondered, saying to one another: Who then is
  this? because he commandeth even the winds and the waters, and they obey
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they sailed to (the)
  country of the Gergesenes, which is over against Galilee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he having come forth on (lit. to) the land, a
  man came forth to him from the city, having (lit. being) demons with him. And
  having been (so) a long time, he clothed himself not with a garment, and
  abode not in a house, but in the sepulchres. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And having seen Jesus, he cried out, he threw
  himself down at his feet, and said with a loud voice: 'What (hast) thou with
  me, Son of God, who liveth? I beseech thee, pain me not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come
  from the man. For it had carried him off many times, and they used to bind
  him with chains and fetters, keeping him; and he used to burst the bonds, and
  the demon used to lead him to the deserts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jesus asked him: What is thy name?' And he
  said: Legion; ' because many devils went into him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they were beseeching him that he would not
  command them to go to (the) abyss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Now there was there a herd of swine feeding in the mountain: and they were
  beseeching him that he would permit them to enter those (swine). And he
  permitted them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the demons having
  come from the man, went into the swine: and the herd of swine came down to
  the lake by (lit. in) the precipice, and were choked. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they who fed (them), having seen what was
  done, fled, and told them who were in the city, and them who were in (the)
  field <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> They came forth to see what was
  done; and they came to Jesus, and they found the man, sitting, out of whom
  the devils came, sane, clothed with his garments, set at (the) feet of Jesus;
  and they feared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And they who saw
  (it) told them in what manner he, with whom were (imperf.) the demons, was
  saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And all the multitude of the
  region round about of the Gergesenes besought him that he would go from them;
  because it (was) a great fear which they were (imperf.) And he entered into
  (the) ship, he returned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> The man out
  of whom the demons came, was beseeching him, that he might stay with him: but
  he sent him (away), saying to him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  Return to thy house, and speak the things which God did with thee.' And he
  went out in all the city, proclaiming the things which God did for him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Jesus having returned, the
  multitude received him to them (lit. him); for they were all looking for him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And lo, a man came, his name being
  Jairus, and this (one) was a ruler of the synagogue: and having thrown
  himself down at (the) feet of Jesus, he was beseeching him to come into his
  house; <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> because he had an only
  daughter, being [in] twelve years (old), and she (lit. this) was going to
  die. And Jesus being about to come, the multitudes were thronging him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And a woman having had an issue of
  blood for twelve years, who (lit. this who) spent all her living on the
  physicians, and could not be healed by any, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> having come forth behind, touched (the) hem of
  his garment: and the issue of blood stanched. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Jesus said: Who touched me?' And all denying,
  Peter and they who were with him said: Teacher, the multitudes surround thee
  and throng thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> But Jesus said:
  Some one touched me: for I knew that power came (lit. a power, it came) out
  of me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the woman. having seen
  that he forgot not, came trembling, and having thrown herself down before
  him, confessed before all the people, for what reason she touched him, and
  the manner in which she was cured immediately. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> He said to her: 'My daughter, thy faith saved
  thee; go in peace.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> (As he is) yet
  speaking, one from the ruler-of-the-synagogue came, saying: Thy daughter
  died, trouble not the teacher.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> But
  Jesus having heard, answered, he said: Fear not; only believe, and she will
  be saved.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And having come to the
  house, he permitted not any to come in with him except Peter, and James, and
  John, and (the) father of the child and her mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And all were weeping and wailing for her: but he
  said: Weep not; for the child died not, but she slept.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And they were mocking him, knowing that she died.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> But he having put (lit, thrown) them
  all (forth), and having laid hold on her hand, called, saying: Child, rise.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And her spirit returned to her, and
  immediately she rose: and he commanded that they should give to her to eat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And her parents were amazed: but he
  ordered them not to say that which was done, to any one.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having called the twelve
  apostles, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons and the
  sicknesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he sent them to
  proclaim the kingdom of God, and to cure them who were sick. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said to them: 'Take not away anything for
  (the) road, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor silver, neither have two
  coats. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the house into which ye
  will go, abide there, until ye come from there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they who will not receive you to them, (as ye
  are) coming from that city, shake off (the) dust of your feet for a witness
  to them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And coming forth, they
  passed through every village, preaching good tidings, and healing in all
  places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Hered the tetrarch heard all
  things which were happening, and he was (imperl) doubtful, because that some
  were saying, that John rose from the dead; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and others, that Elias manifestest himself; and
  others, that a prophet of the old (prophets) rose. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Herod said: John I beheaded: but who is this,
  concerning whom I hear these (things) of this kind?' And he was seeking to
  see him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the apostles, having
  returned, spoke before him the things which they did. And he took them away
  with him, he went apart alone into a city called Bethsaida.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But those multitudes were walking after him: and
  having received them to him, he was speaking to them concerning the kingdom
  of God, and them who had need of healing he was curing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the day was beginning to decline. And the
  twelve, having come to him, said to him: Send the multitudes away, that they
  may go to the villages which are around, and the fields, that they may rest
  themselves, and find that which they will eat: because we are here in a
  desert place.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to them:
  'Give ye to them to eat.' And they said: There are not more than five loaves
  with us and two fishes; except we go and buy victuals for all this people.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they were (imperf.) about five
  thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Let them sit down to meat by
  companies (lit. place) of fifty to (the) company.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they did thus, he made them all sit down to
  meat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And having taken the five
  loaves and the two fishes, having gazed up to (the) heaven, he blessed them,
  and brake them, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they ate and were all satisfied:
  and they took up that, which remained over to them, twelve baskets of
  fragments filled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And it came to pass
  (that) he being apart alone, praying, the disciples were (imperf.) with him;
  and he asked them, saying: Whom said [the] men that I (am)? ' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they answered, they said: John the Baptist;
  but others, "Elias;" and others, that a prophet of the old (prophets) rose.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said to them: But whom said ye
  that I (am)?' And Peter answered, he said: Thou art Christ God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he having charged them, ordered (them) not to
  say this to any one; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> having said,
  that (the) Son of (the) man must suffer much; and the elders and chief
  priests and the scribes (must) reject him, and kill him, and he (must) rise
  on the third day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he was saying
  to all: 'He who will wish to follow me, let him deny himself, and let him
  take up his cross daily, and walk after me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For he who wisheth to save his life (lit. soul
  thus again) will destroy it; and he who will destroy his life because of me,
  shall save it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For what will the man
  gain, if he should gain the whole world, and destroy his own self or forfeit
  himself? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For he who will be ashamed
  of me and my words, of this (one) also (the) Son of (the) man will be
  ashamed, if he should come in his glory, and that of his Father, and his holy
  angels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I say to you truly, that
  there are some among them who stand here, who will not taste of (the) death,
  until they see the kingdom of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  And it came to pass after these words about eight days, (that) he took away
  Peter and James and John; he went upon the mountain to pray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And it came to pass in his praying, (that the)
  form of his face was changed, and his vesture was white and (lit. as)
  flashing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And behold, two men were
  speaking to him, who are Moses and Elias; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> who manifested themselves in glory; they were
  speaking of his exodus, which he was to fulfil in Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Peter and they who were with him had been
  heavy with slumber: but having kept watch, they saw his glory, and the two
  men who were standing with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And
  it came to pass, (that) they being about to part from him, Peter said to
  Jesus: Teacher, it is good for us that we be here; and--if thou wishest--that
  we make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
  Elias;' he knoweth not that which he said. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And (as he is) saying these (things), there was a
  cloud, and it shadowed over them: and they feared, having gone into the
  cloud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And there was a voice out of
  the cloud, saying: This is my Son, who is chosen, hearken to him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the voice having been (heard),
  Jesus alone was found. And they held their peace, and told not to any one in
  those days any of the things which they saw. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And it came to pass on the (lit. his) morrow,
  (that) they having come down from the mountain, a great multitude came forth
  to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And behold, a man from the
  multitude cried out: Teacher, I beseech thee look upon my son: because he is
  an only son to me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and lo, spirit
  cometh upon him, and suddenly he crieth out, and he convulseth him, and he
  hurleth him down, and his mouth foameth, and it hardly goeth from him,
  bruising him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And I besought thy
  disciples that they would cast it out; and they could not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Jesus answered, and said: O [the] faithless
  generation and which is perverse, how long shall (lit. will) I be with you,
  and bear with you? bring thy son to me hither.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> (As he is) yet coming in to him, the demon hurled
  him down, and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean demon, and cured
  the child, and gave him to his father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> They all were wondering at the greatness of God.
  But (as) all (are) wondering at all things which he was doing, He said to his
  disciples: <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Set ye these words in your
  ears: for (the) Son of (the) man will be given into (the) hands of men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> But they understood not (lit. were
  forgetting) this word, and it was (imperf.) hidden from them, [and] that they
  might not understand it; they were fearing to ask him concerning this word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And a reasoning came into them, as to
  which of them is the great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And
  Jesus, having seen the reasoning of their heart, took hold of a child, he
  made him stand by him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> and said to
  them: He who will receive this child to him in my name, he received me: and
  he who receiveth me received him who sent me: for he who is little among you
  all, this is the great.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And John
  answered: 'Teacher, we saw one casting demons out in thy name, and we forbade
  him, because he walketh not with us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>
  But Jesus said: Forbid not: for he is not against you: for he who is not
  against you is for (lit. on) you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span>
  And it came to pass, (that) the days of his being received up having been
  fulfilled, [and] he set steadfastly his face to go to Jerusalem, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> and he sent messengers forth before him: and
  having gone, they came into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And they received him not to
  them, because his face was (imperf.) directed towards Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And his disciples James and John having seen
  (it), said: Lord, wishest thou that we say (the word), and that fire come
  from (the) heaven, and burn them, as Elias worked.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> But having turned himself, he rebuked them,
  saying: Ye know not (of) what spirit ye are; and (that the) Son of (the) man
  cometh not to destroy the lives of [the] men, but to make live.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And they went to another village. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And (as they are) walking on the road, one said
  to him: 'Let me walk after thee whither thou goest.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the
  birds of (the) heaven have nests; but (the) Son of (the) man hath not where
  to put his head.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And he said to
  another: Walk after me.' But he said: My Lord, command me first, that I go
  and bury my father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> He said to him:
  'Leave the dead, let them embalm their dead; but go thou proclaim the kingdom
  of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And another said to him: 'I
  will walk after thee, Lord; command me first, that I take leave of them who
  are in my house.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> But Jesus said to
  him: 'No one having put (lit. thrown) his hand to a plough, and looked back,
  will be right for (lit, in) the kingdom of God.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after these (things) the Lord
  appointed (lit. manifested) seventy others, and he sent them forth two (and)
  two before him into every city and all places, to which he was to go.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He was saying to them: 'The harvest
  indeed is great, but the labourers are few: pray then the Lord of the
  harvest, that he would send (lit. throw, of. Matthew 12:20) forth labourers
  to his harvest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Go: lo, I send you as
  lambs in (the) midst of wolves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Carry
  not purse, nor scrip, nor shoe: and salute not any one on (the) road.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the house which ye go into,--say
  first: "(The) peace (be) to this house." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if (the) son of the peace is there, your peace
  shall rest [itself] upon it: if not, your peace shall return to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And abide in that house, eating and
  drinking the things which they have: for the labourer is worthy of his food.
  Remove not from house to house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  the city which ye will go into, and they receive you to them, eat the things
  which they will set before you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and
  heal them who are sick in it, and say to them, that the kingdom of God
  approached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But the city which ye
  will go into, and they receive "you not to them, come forth in its streets,
  say: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Even the dust, which clave to
  our feet from your city, we will shake off against (lit. for) you: but know
  this, that the kingdom of God approached." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I say to you, that there is to be rest for Sodom
  in that day, (rather) than (for) that city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida!
  for in Tyre and Sidon if (there had) been done these mighty works, which were
  done in you, long ago they (would have) repented, sitting in sackcloth and
  ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Tyre and Sidon,--there is
  to be rest for them in the judgement, rather than (for) you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And thou also Kapharnaum, wilt thou be exalted up
  to (the) heaven? thou wilt be humiliated down to Amenti. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He who hearkeneth to you hearkened to me: and he
  who rejecteth you rejected me; he who rejecteth me rejected him who sent me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the seventy returned with joy,
  saying: `Lord, even the demons are subject to us in thy name.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to them: 'I saw Satan fall (lit. who
  fell) from (the) heaven as lightning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Lo, I gave to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and
  upon all the power of the enemy; and ye (lit. he) shall not suffer (lit.
  treat you with) any violence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But
  rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice [(in)
  that], that your names are written in the heavens.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And in that hour he was glad in the Holy Spirit,
  and he said: I confess to thee, Father, Lord of (the) heaven and the earth,
  because thou hiddest these (things) from (lit. to) wise and understanding,
  and revealedst them to little children: yea, Father, because this is [as] the
  good pleasure which was before thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  All things were given to me by my Father: and no one knoweth who is (the)
  Son, except the Father; and who is the Father, except (the) Son, and he to
  whom (the) Son wisheth to reveal him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And having turned himself to his disciples apart
  alone, he said: 'Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> for I say to you, that many prophets
  and kings wished to see the things which ye see, and they saw them not; and
  to hear the things which ye hear, and they heard them not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And behold, a lawyer rose, he tempted him,
  saying: Teacher, what shall (lit. will) I do that I may inherit eternal
  life?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he said to him: What is
  written in the law? or in what manner didst thou read?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he answered, he said: Thou shalt love the
  Lord thy God from all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy power, and in
  all thy thought; and thy neighbour (lit. friend) as thyself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> 'And he said to him: 'Thou answeredst rightly:
  this do, and thou wilt live.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But he
  wishing to he justified, said to Jesus: Who also is my neighbour (lit.
  friend)?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jesus answered, he
  said: There was a man coming down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he came
  among robbers; and having stripped him, they gave wounds to him, they went
  (away), they left him being half dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And by chance a priest was coming down by that
  road: and having seen him, he passed him, he left him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Also a Levite having come upon the place, and
  having seen him, left him, he passed him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But a Samaritan walked, he came up to him, and
  having seen him, had compassion; <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and
  having come, he bound his wounds, he poured (lit. gave) oil and wine along
  them; having placed him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took
  care of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And on the (lit. his)
  morrow he brought forth two denars, he gave them to the host, and said: "Take
  care of him with these; and the more which thou wilt spend for him, I, if I
  should return, will pay (lit. give to) thee." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Which then of these three, thinkest thou, that he
  was neighbour (lit. friend) to him who came among the robbers?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he said: He who shewed (lit. did) the pity to
  (lit. with) him.' And Jesus said to him: Go, do thou also thus.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And (as they are) walking, he went into a
  village: a woman, her name being Martha, received him to her into her house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And she (lit. this) had a sister
  called Mary.' And having sat at (the) feet of the Lord, she was hearing his
  word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But Martha was (imperf.)
  anxious about much ministering. Having stood, she said: Lord, carest thou
  not, that my sister left me alone to minister? Bid her then that she help
  me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Jesus answered, he said to her:
  Martha, Martha, thou takest care, and thou art troubled concerning many
  things: <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> but (of) few things is the
  need, or (of) one: for Mary chose for herself the good part, which will not
  be taken away from her.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass, (that) he
  being in a place, praying, having ceased, one of his disciples said to him:
  'Lord, teach us to pray, according as John taught his disciples.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said to them: When ye should
  pray, say: Our Father who art in the heavens, hallowed be thy name. Thy
  kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in (the) heaven, so upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Give to us daily our bread which
  cometh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And forgive us our sins, for
  we ourselves forgive our debtors. And bring us not into temptation.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to them: 'Which of you
  hath a friend, and he go unto him at midnight, and say to him: "My friend,
  lend to me three loaves; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> because a
  friend of mine came unto me from (the) road, and there is not that which I
  shall (lit. will) set before him;" <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and
  he also who is inside answers and says: "Trouble me not; for I have shut my
  door, and my children are with me upon my bed (lit. place of sleep); it is
  not possible for me to rise and give to thee." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I say to you, that even if he should not rise to
  give to him, because he is his friend, but because of his importunity he
  shall rise and give to him the things of which he had need. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I also say to you: "Ask, and it will be given to
  you. Seek, and ye will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For every one who asketh receiveth;
  and he who seeketh findeth; and to him who knocketh, they open. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And what father who is among you, whose son will
  ask him for a loaf, will he give a stone to him? Or he ask him for a fish,
  will he instead of a fish give a serpent to him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Or he ask an egg, will he give a scorpion to him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> If then ye, being evil, know how to
  give good gifts to your sons, how much rather will the Father give the (lit.
  a) Holy Spirit in (the) heaven to them who ask him?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he was casting out a deaf demon. And it came
  to pass (that), the demon having come out, the deaf spake; and the multitudes
  wondered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But some of them said:
  By(lit. in) Belzebul (the) ruler of the demons he cast out the demons.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And others, tempting, were seeking
  for a sign from him out of (the) heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them:
  Every kingdom if it should be divided against itself is desolated; and a
  house against a house falleth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if
  Satan also was divided against himself, how then will his kingdom be able to
  stand? because ye say, that by (lit. in) Belzebul I cast out the demons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if I by (lit. in) Belzebul cast
  out the demons, by (lit. in) whom did your sons cast out? therefore they are
  judges to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But if I by (lit. in)
  the (lit. a) finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God
  reached you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For if the strong man
  should arm himself and keep his court, his possessions are in peace:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> but if a stronger than he come upon
  him, and conquer him, he taketh away his armour to which he was trusting, and
  he scattereth his spoils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He who is
  not with me was against me; and he who gathereth not with me scattereth me
  away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> If the unclean spirit should
  come from the man, he passeth through dry places seeking for a resting-place;
  and if he should not find, then he said: "I shall (lit. will) return to my
  house from which I came." <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And if he
  should come and find it empty, swept, garnished; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> then he goeth and findeth seven other spirits
  more evil than himself, and if they should go in, they dwell there, and the
  last (states) of that man are worse than his first.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it came to pass (that as he is) saying these
  (things), a woman lifted up a voice from the multitude, she said to him:
  Blessed is the womb which bare (lit. lifted) thee, and the breasts which
  nourished thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But he said to her:
  Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, and who keep it.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the multitudes being about to
  assemble, he began to say: This generation is an evil generation, seeking for
  a sign; and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jona the
  prophet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For according as Jona was a
  sign to the Ninevites, thus also (the) Son of (the) man will be to this
  generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The queen of the south
  shall rise in the judgement with the men of this generation, and shall judge
  them: because she came from the ends of (the) earth to hear the wisdom of
  Solomon; and lo, greater than Solomon (is) here. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The men of Nineve will rise in the judgement with
  this generation, and will judge it: because they repented at the preaching of
  Jona, and lo, greater than Jona (is) here. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> No one lighteth a lamp and setteth it in a secret
  place, nor under a measurer, but upon the lampstand, that they who go in may
  see the light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> (The) lamp of thy body
  is thine eye: if thine eye is single, all thy body shall give light; but if
  (it) is evil, all thy body is dark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  Take heed lest the light which is in thee is darkness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> If then all thy body is light, having no part
  dark, all shall be shining, as the lamp with the flashing shall give light.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he having spoken, a Pharisee
  besought him that would eat with him: and having entered, he sat down to
  meat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the Pharisee having seen,
  wondered that he washed not first before the eating. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Jesus said to him: Now ye of the Pharisees
  cleanse outside of the cup and the dish; but inside of you (is) full of
  extortion and wickedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Senseless
  (men), did not he, who made outside, also make inside? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> But the things which ye have (lit. which are)
  give for (the) alms; and lo, all things are cleansed to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But woe to you, Pharisees! because ye give (the)
  tenth of the mint and the rue and every herb, and ye leave (out) [the]
  judgement and the love of God: but these it was (imperf.) right that ye
  should do, and the others that ye should not have left (out). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Woe to you, Pharisees! because ye love the first
  sittings in the synagogues, and the salutations in the market-places.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Woe to you! because ye are as the
  sepulchres which appear not, and the men who walk upon them know not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And one of the lawyers answered, he
  said to him: Teacher, saying these (things) thou reproachest us also.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And he said: Ye also of the lawyers,
  woe to you! because ye place burdens painful to be borne upon [the] men, and
  ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Woe to you! because ye build the sepulchres of
  the prophets; your fathers killed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Then ye bear witness and agree to the works of
  your fathers: because they indeed killed them, ye build. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Therefore also the wisdom of God said: "I shall
  (lit. will) send to them prophets and apostles, and they shall kill (some) of
  them, and they shall persecute them;" <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>
  that (the) blood of the prophets, which was shed from (the) foundation of the
  world, may be avenged on this generation; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> from (the) blood of Abel unto (the) blood of
  Zacharias (the) son of Barachias, whom they destroyed between the altar and
  the House: yea, I say to you, that it will all be sought for from this
  generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Woe to you, Lawyers!
  because ye took away the keys of (the) knowledge: ye came not in yourselves,
  and them who are coining in ye hindered.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And he having come from there, the scribes and
  the Pharisees began to watch (him) maliciously, and to speak to him
  concerning many things: <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> using
  subtlety to ensnare him with a word from his mouth.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the mean time myriads of
  multitude having assembled, so that they trode upon one another, he began to
  say to his disciples first: Beware of (the) leaven of the Pharisees, which is
  their hypocrisy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> There is not anything
  covered, (so) that it will not be revealed; and there is not that which is
  hidden, (so) that it will not be known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the things which ye will say in (the) darkness
  will be heard in (the) light; and that which ye spake in (the) ear in the
  chambers shall be preached upon the housetops. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I say to you my friends: "Fear not them who
  will kill your body, and after these (things) they have not anything more to
  do." <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But I shall (lit. will) tell you
  whom (ye shall) fear (imperative). Fear him who after his killing hath
  authority to cast to the Geenna; yea, I say to you: "Fear this (one)."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Are not five sparrows sold for two
  farthings? and one of them is not forgotten before God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
  Fear not: ye are better than many sparrows. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I say to you, that every one who will confess
  me before [the] men, (the) Son of (the) man also will confess him before the
  angels of God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but he who will deny me
  before [the men] will be denied also before the angels of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And every one who will say a word at (the) Son of
  (the) man, it will be forgiven him: but he who will blaspheme the Holy
  Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  When they should bring you into the synagogues, and (before) the rulers, and
  the authorities, take no care how or what ye will answer, or what ye will
  say. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For the Holy Spirit will teach
  you in that hour the things which it will be right to say.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And one said to him from the multitude: 'Teacher,
  bid my brother divide with me the inheritance.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But he said: Man, who set me for judge or for
  divider over you?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to
  them: Take heed, and keep yourselves from all taking by violence: because
  (the) life was not consisting for the man out of (the) abundance of that
  which he hath.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he spake (lit.
  said) a parable to them, saying: There was a rich man whose country was
  fertile:" <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and he was reasoning in
  himself, saying: "What shall (lit. will) I do, because I have not place to
  which to gather my fruits?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he
  said: "This I will do: I will overthrow my barns, and I will build them
  greater, and I gather thither all my wheat and my goods. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will say to my soul: My soul, there are
  many goods laid up for thee for many years; rest thyself, eat, drink, delight
  thyself.'" <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But God said to him:
  "Senseless (man), in this night they will take away thy soul from thee; the
  things which thou gatheredst, whose will they be?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> This is as he who layeth up (lit. throweth in)
  for himself, and is not rich toward (lit. in) God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he said to his disciples: "Therefore I say to
  you: "Do not take care about your life (lit. soul), viz. what will ye eat;
  nor about your body, viz. with what will ye clothe yourselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the life (lit. soul) is better than the food,
  and the body than the raiment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Consider the ravens, that they sow not and reap not; which have not
  storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much better are ye than the
  birds <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For which of you, taking care,
  is it possible to add (lit. place upon) a cubit to his stature? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> If then it is not possible for you (to do) a
  little, wherefore take ye care about (the) rest? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Consider the flowers, how they grow, they toil
  not, nor spin; yet I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory clothed
  himself not as one of these. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if
  thus God robeth the grass, (which) is to-day in (the) field, and to-morrow
  they cast it to the oven, how much rather (shall he clothe you, ye) of [the]
  little faith? <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And seek not ye also
  what ye will eat, and what ye will drink, and take not care. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For all these (things) the Gentiles of the world
  seek for: your Father knoweth that ye have need of these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But seek for his kingdom, and all
  (these) things will be added to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Fear not, little flock, because your Father was well pleased to give to you
  the kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Sell your possessions,
  give them for alms; make for you purses (which) become not old, an unfailing
  treasure in the heavens, the place to which thieves approach not, nor moth
  destroyeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For the place in which
  your treasure (is), your heart shall be there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Let your loins be girt, and your lamps kindled;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> and ye also like to men looking for
  their Lord, when he will return (lit. unloose) from the marriage feast; that
  if he should come and knock, they may immediately open to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Blessed are those servants, [who] if their Lord
  should come, and find them watching: verily I say to you, that he will gird
  himself, and make them sit down to meat, and stand and minister to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And if he should come in the second,
  and if he should come in the third watch, and find them watching thus,
  blessed are those (servants). <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But
  know this, that (if) the owner-ofthe-house knew (inaperf.) in what hour the
  thief cometh, he would have watched, and would not have permitted them to
  break through his house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And be ye
  also prepared: because in the hour which ye know not (the) Son of (the) man
  cometh."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Peter said: Lord,
  saidst thou this parable to us, or saidst thou it to all?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And the Lord said: Who then is the faithful
  steward and wise, whom his Lord will set over his servants, that he may give
  to them their food in (the) time of giving it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Blessed is that servant, [who] if his Lord should
  come and find him doing thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Truly I
  say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> But if that servant should say in his heart: "My
  Lord will delay; he cometh not yet;" and begin to strike (lit. throw) the
  servants and the women servants, and eat and drink, and be drunken;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> the Lord of that servant will come in
  the day (in) which he expecteth him not, and in the hour which he knoweth
  not, and he will cut him asunder, and will set his part with the unbelievers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And that servant, who knew (the) wish
  of his Lord, and who prepared not, and did not according to his wish, will be
  given many stripes; <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> but he who knew
  not, and did the things which are worthy of stripes, will be given few
  stripes. From every one to whom they gave much, they will seek for much and
  of him to whom they committed much, they will ask the more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what
  shall (lit. will) I wish, (rather) than (that) it was already kindled?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> But I have a baptism to be baptised
  (with); and how am I straitened until it is finished! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Thought ye that I came to send (lit. cast) peace
  upon the earth? Nay, I say to you; but division. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> For henceforth there shall be five in one house
  divided, three against two, and two against three. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> They shall be divided, a father against a son,
  and a son against a father; a mother against a daughter, and a daughter
  against her mother; a mother-in-law against a daughter-in-law, and a
  daughter-in-law against a mother-in-law.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And he was saying to the multitudes also: When ye
  should see a cloud having come from the west, ye say immediately: "rain
  cometh;" and it happeneth thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And
  when a south wind (is) blowing, ye say: "Scorching heat will happen."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Hypocrites, ye know how to prove
  (the) face of (the) heaven and the earth, but how know ye not how to prove
  this time? <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> Wherefore judge ye not the
  right by your selves alone? <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> For as
  thou wilt go with thine adversary unto a ruler, give diligence to be quit of
  him on the road; lest haply he draw thee to the judge, and the judge deliver
  thee to the exactor, and the exactor cast thee to the prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> I say to thee, that thou shalt not come from
  there, until thou payest the last mite.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> There had come to him at that time
  some telling him concerning the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with
  their sacrifices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he answered, he
  said to them: Thought ye that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the
  Galileans, because they received these pains? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Nay, I say to you: but if ye should not repent, ye
  will all perish thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Or the eighteen
  men, upon whom the tower fell in the Siloam, and killed them, thought ye that
  these were debtors beyond all men who dwelt in Jerusalem? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Nay, I say to you: but if ye should not repent, ye
  will all perish thus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he was
  speaking (lit. saying) this parable to them: (A certain) one had a fig-tree
  planted in his vineyard; and he came, he sought for fruit on it, he found
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to the vinedresser:
  "Lo, for (lit. from) three years I come (lit. coming) seeking for fruit in
  this fig-tree, and I find not: cut it down then; why maketh it also useless
  any longer the earth? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he answered,
  he said to him: "My Lord, leave it this year also, until I dig under it, and
  dung it: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> perhaps it may bring forth
  fruit in the year also which cometh: but if it should not bring (forth), thou
  shalt cut it down." ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he was
  teaching in one of the synagogues on (the) sabbath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And behold, a woman having (lit. being set) a
  spirit of sickness with her for eighteen years; and she was (imperf.) bent,
  unable to straighten herself at all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And Jesus having seen her, called her, and said to her: Woman, thou art
  unloosed (lit. set) from thy sickness.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he laid his hands upon her: and she was
  straightened immediately, and glorified God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the ruler of the synagogue answered, being
  angry because Jesus healed her on (the) sabbath, he was saying to the
  multitude: (There are) six days on which it is lawful to work: on them then
  come, and let them be healed, and on (the) day of (the) sabbath not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But Jesus answered him and said:
  Hypocrites, doth not each of you unloose his cow or his ass from the manger
  on (the) sabbath, and taketh them and giveth them to drink? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And this (woman), being a daughter of Abraam,
  whom Satan bound, lo, eighteen years; was it not lawful to loose her from
  this bond on (the) day of (the) sabbath?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And (as he is) speaking these (things), they who
  were against him were (imperf.) all ashamed: and all the people were
  rejoicing over all the noble things which were done by him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He was saying then: To what was the kingdom of
  God like? and to what am I to liken it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man
  took, he sowed it in his garden; and it grew and became a tree; and the birds
  of (the) heaven lodged upon its branches.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And again he said: To what am I to liken the
  kingdom of God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It is like leaven,
  which a woman took, she hid it in three measures of meal, until all was
  leavened.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he was walking
  (through) every city and village, teaching, and making his journey to
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And one said to him: Lord,
  (are there) few who will be saved?' And he said to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Strive to come in at the narrow door: because
  there are many, I say to you, (who) will seek for coming in, and they shall
  not be able. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> If the
  owner-of-the-house should come to rise, and shut the door, and ye begin to
  stand outside, and to knock the door, [and] saying: "Lord, open to us;" and
  he answer and say to you: "I know you not whence ye are." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then ye shall begin to say: "We ate before thee
  and we drank, and thou taughtest in our streets;" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and he will say: "I know you not whence ye are;
  go from me, all the workers of [the] unrighteousness." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> (In) that place will be (the) weeping and (the)
  gnashing of the teeth, when ye should see Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, and
  all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, but yourselves cast out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they shall come from the risings
  and the settings, and (the) north and the south, and they shall sit down to
  meat in the kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And lo,
  there are last about to be first, and first about to be last.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And in that day the Pharisees came to him, saying
  to him: 'Go, and depart (from) this (place); because Herod wishes to kill
  thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he said to them: Go, say
  to this fox (fem.): "Lo, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and
  to-morrow, and on the third day I shall (lit. will) finish." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But I must have (lit. make) to-day and to-morrow
  and the next day (lit. which cometh), and go: because it is not right (lit.
  set) that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killed the prophets,
  and cast stones upon them who were sent to her! How many times I wished to
  gather thy sons, as a hen (gathereth) her (lit. his) brood under her (lit.
  his) wings, and ye wished not! <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  Behold, your house is left to you: and I say to you, that ye shall not see me
  henceforth, until ye say: "Blessed is he who cometh in (the) name of the
  Lord."'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass that (lit. and)
  he having come into (the) house of a ruler of the Pharisees on (the) sabbath
  to eat bread, they were observing him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And lo, there was a man who had the dropsy, set before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to the lawyers and the
  Pharisees, saying: 'It it lawful to do good on (the) sabbath or not? '
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they held their peace. And he took
  hold of him, he cured him, he sent him away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to them: Which (is there) of
  you--whose ass or his cow will fall into a well, and he will not draw (lit.
  bring) him up on (the) day of the sabbaths?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they could not answer him against these
  (things). <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he was speaking (lit.
  saying) a parable to them who were invited, seeing how they were choosing for
  themselves the first seats, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  When one should invite thee to marriage feasts, sit not down to meat at the
  first seat, lest another more noble than thou was invited, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and he who invited thee and him come and say to
  thee: "Leave the place for this (one);" then thou wilt begin with shame to
  occupy the last place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But when thou
  shouldest be invited, go, sit down to meat in the last (place), that, when he
  who invited thee should come, he may say to thee: "My friend, remove thee up
  (higher):" then there shall be glory for thee before all who sit down to meat
  with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Because every one who will
  exalt himself will be humiliated, and he who will humiliate himself will be
  exalted.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he was saying to him
  who invited him: When thou shouldest make a dinner or a supper, call not thy
  friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy kinsfolk, nor thy rich neighbours; lest
  they invite thee also, and a recompense be made to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But if thou shouldest make a feast, call poor,
  impotent, lame, blind: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and thou wilt
  be blessed; because they have not (wherewith) to recompense thee: for thou
  wilt be recompensed in the resurrection of the righteous.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And one of them who sat at meat, having heard
  these (things), said: Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But he said to him: (There was)
  a man who made a great supper; and invited many: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and he sent his servant at (the) hour of supper
  to say to them who were invited, to make them come: "Now all things are
  prepared." <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they all began to make
  excuse with one voice (lit. cry). The first said: "I bought a field, and
  there is necessity for me to go out and see it: I beseech thee, put me from
  thee as that I do not conic." <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  another said: "I bought five yoke (lit. plough) of oxen, and I shall (lit.
  will) go and prove them: I beseech thee, put me from thee as that I come
  not." <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And another said: "I have taken
  a wife, and therefore I shall (lit. will) not come." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the servant having come, told his lord. Then
  the owner-of-the-house having been angry said to his servant: "Go out quickly
  to the streets and the lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and
  the impotent, and the blind." <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the
  servant said: "Lord, the thing which thou commandedst was done, and yet there
  is room." <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the lord of the servant
  said to him: "Go out to the roads and the hedges, and compel to come in, that
  my house may be filled: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For I say to
  you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper."'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And great multitudes were walking
  with him: and having turned, he said to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He who cometh to me, and who will not hate his
  father, and his mother, and his wife, and his sons, and his brothers, and his
  sisters, and further even his very life, it is not possible for him to be
  disciple to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For which of you, wishing to build a tower, will
  not sit first and count the cost, whether he have (wherewith) to complete it?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Lest he lay the foundation, and it is
  not possible to finish it; and all who see begin to mock him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> saying: "This man began to build, and he could
  not finish it." <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Or what king, who
  will go to (the) war to fight with another king, will not sit first and take
  counsel, whether it is possible for him with ten thousand to meet him who
  cometh upon him with twenty thousand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Otherwise, while he is yet distant from him, he sendeth an embassy, seeking
  for peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Thus for every one who is
  among you, who will not renounce all his possessions, it is not possible to
  be disciple to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> [The] salt is
  good: but if the salt lose its savour, with what is it to be salted?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Neither (for) the earth nor the

  saying that this (man) receiveth the sinners to him, and eateth with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He spake (lit. said) this parable to
  them, saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> What man who is among
  you, who hath a hundred sheep, if he should lose one of them,--leaveth he not
  the ninety-nine on (the) desert, and goeth, and seeketh for that which was
  lost, until he find it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And if he
  should find it, he placeth it upon his shoulders, rejoicing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if he should come to the house, he calleth his
  friends and his neighbours, saying to them: "Rejoice all with me, because I
  found my sheep which was lost. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I say
  to you, that there is joy to be in (the) heaven over one sinner repenting,
  (more) than over the ninety-nine righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Or what woman who has ten half didrachmas, if she
  should lose one of them, lighteth not a lamp, and sweepeth the house, and
  seeketh carefully until she find it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And if she should find it, she calleth her friends and neighbours, saying:
  "Rejoice with me, because I found my half didrachma which was lost."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thus I say to you, that there is joy
  before the angels of God over one sinner repenting.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he said: There was a man who had two sons:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and the younger of (lit. who was in)
  them said to his father: "My father, give to me my portion of the substance."
  And he divided the living among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And after not many days the younger son gathered everything, he went to (the)
  foreign (land) to a distant country; and he scattered his substance there,
  living dissolutely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And having quite
  spent everything, a great famine happened in that country; and he also began
  to be in want. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he went, he joined
  himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him to (the)
  field to feed swine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he was
  desiring to fill his belly with the pods which the swine were eating: and
  there was no one giving to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But
  his right-mind (lit. heart) having come to him, he said: "How many are there
  of hirelings of my father, (who) have [the] bread in abundance, and I shall
  (lit. will) perish here in famine! <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I
  will rise and go to my father, and say to him: My father, I sinned against
  (the) heaven, and before thee: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I am
  no longer worthy to be called "thy son:" make me as one of thy hirelings.'"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he rose, he came to his father.
  But yet being distant from him, his father saw him, and had compassion, he
  ran, he threw himself upon his neck, and kissed his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And his son said to him: "My father, I sinned
  against (the) heaven, and before thee: I am not worthy any longer to be
  called thy son.'" <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And his father said
  to his servants: "Be quick, bring out the first robe, and clothe him; and put
  (lit. give) a ring on (lit. to) his hand, and shoe on (lit. to) his feet:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and bring the fatted calf, slay it,
  and let us eat, and delight ourselves: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> because this my son was (imperf.) dead, and
  lived; he was (imperf.) lost, and we found him." And they began to delight
  themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Now his elder (lit.
  great) son was (imperf.) in (the) field: and as he (is) coming up, he
  approached to the house, he heard music and dances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And having called one of the servants (lit.
  children), he was asking him what were these (things). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he said to him: "Thy brother came; and thy
  father slew the fatted calf, because he received him in health." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But he was angry, and wished not to come in: and
  his father having come out, was beseeching him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But he having answered, said to his father: "Lo,
  how many years do I serve thee? and I never transgressed a commandment of
  thine: and to me thou never gavest a kid, that I might delight myself with my
  friends: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> but when thy son came, he
  (lit. this) who ate (up) his living with the harlots, thou killedst for him
  the fatted calf." <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said to him:
  "My son, thou art with me always, and all the things which are mine are
  thine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> It was (imperf.) right that we
  should delight ourselves and rejoice: because this thy brother was (imperf.)
  dead, and he lived; he was (imperf.) lost, and we found him."'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he was saying to the disciples:
  'There was a rich man, who had a steward; and this (man) was accused before
  him as scattering his possessions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  having called him, he said to him: "What is this which I hear concerning
  thee? Give (the) account of the stewardship; for thou wilt be steward no
  longer." <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the steward said in
  himself: "What shall (lit. will) I do? My lord will take away the stewardship
  from me. I shall (lit. will) not be able to dig; and I am ashamed to need
  alms. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I know (lit. knew) what I will
  do, that, when I should be cast out of the stewardship, they may receive me
  to them into their houses." <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having
  called each of the debtors of his lord, he was saying to the first: "How much
  owest thou to my lord?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said:
  "A hundred baths of oil." And heo said: "Take thy writings, sit and quickly
  write fifty." <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then he said to another:
  "And how much owest thou?" And he said: "A hundred cors of wheat." He said to
  him: "Take thy writings, and write eighty." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the lord commended the steward of [the]
  unrighteousness because he did wisely: because the sons of this age are wiser
  than the sons of (the) light in their generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I also say to you: "Make for you friends out
  of mamon of (the) unrighteousness; that, when they should fail, they may
  receive you into the eternal tabernacles." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The faithful in little is faithful also in great:
  and he who taketh by violence in little, taketh by violence also in great.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If then in the unrighteous mamon ye
  were not faithful, who then will be able to entrust you with the true?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And if in that which is not yours ye
  were not faithful, who will be able to give to you that which is yours?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> No servant will be able to serve two
  lords: for either he will hate one, and the other he will love; or he will
  hearken to one, and the other he will despise. It is not possible for you to
  serve God and mamon.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the
  Pharisees who were lovers of silver were hearing all these (things), and they
  were deriding him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to
  them: Ye are they who justify themselves before the men; but God knoweth your
  hearts: because (the) pride which is in the man is an abomination before God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The law and the prophets (were) until
  John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one taketh
  himself by violence into it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But it
  is easier that (the) heaven and (the) earth pass away, than that a point fall
  from the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Every one who putteth
  away his wife, and who taketh another committeth adultery: and he who taketh
  her who is put away from her husband committeth adultery. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Now there was a rich man, and he used to clothe
  himself with purple and fine linen, delighting (himself) daily sumptuously:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and a beggar also, his name being
  Lazarus, lying (lit. thrown) into his porch, being (full) of wounds,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and desiring to fill his belly with
  the things which fall from the table of the rich (man); moreover, even the
  dogs were coming, licking his wounds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and he was taken away by angels to
  the bosom of Abraam: and the rich man also died, and he was embalmed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And in Amenti having lifted up his
  eyes, being in pains, he saw Abraam afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he having called said: "My father
  Abraam, pity me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in
  water, and cool my tongue; because I am in pain in this fiame." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Abraam said: "My son, remember that thou
  finishedst receiving thy good (things) in thy life, and Lazarus also the evil
  (things): but now he is comforted here, and thou art in pain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And beside (lit. in) all these (things) there is
  a great pit fixed between us and you, that they who wish to pass from here
  (lit. this) to you should not be able, nor they who are with you to cross to
  us." <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he said: "I beseech thee, my
  father, that thou wouldest send him to (the) house of my father; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> for I have five brothers; that he may bear
  witness to them, that they may not come also to this place of this pain."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Abraam said: "They have Moses and
  the prophets; let them hearken to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he said: "Nay, my father, Abraam: but if one
  should go to them from the dead they will repent." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said to him: "If they will hearken not to
  Moses and the prophets, neither, if one should rise from the dead, will they
  be persuaded."'</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he said to his disciples: 'It
  is necessary that the offences come: but woe to him by whom the offence
  cometh! <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> It is good for him, that a
  millstone be hanged to him, and that he be cast into the sea, (rather) than
  that he offend one of these little ones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Give heed to yourselves: if thy brother should
  sin, rebuke him; and if he should repent, forgive him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if he should sin against thee seven times in
  the day, and return to thee seven times, saying: "I repent;" forgive him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the apostles said to the Lord: Add
  faith to us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord said: If ye
  have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say to the sycamine-tree: "Be
  plucked up, and grow up in the sea; and it would hearken to you. <span style=

  shall (lit. will) eat, and gird thyself, minister to me, until I eat and
  drink; and after these (things) thou also eat and drink? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Hath he thanks for the servant, because he did the
  things which he commanded him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thus
  ye also, if ye should do all things which were commanded you, say: "We (are)
  unprofitable servants; that which we ought to do, we did."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> It came to pass (as he is) going up to Jerusalem,
  that (lit. and) he was passing through (the) midst of (the) Samaria and
  Galilee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And being about to go into a
  village, ten men, lepers, met him; and they were standing afar off:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and they were lifting-up their voice,
  saying: Jesus, the Teacher, pity us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And having seen, he said to them: Go shew yourselves to the priest.' And it
  came to pass (that as they are) going they were cleansed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And one of them, having seen that he recovered,
  returned with a loud voice glorifying God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he threw himself upon his face at his feet,
  giving thanks to him: and this (one) was a Samaritan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jesus answered, he said: 'Were not the ten
  cleansed? where are the other nine? is <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And there were not found who returned to glorify
  God, except this alien.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he said
  to him: 'Rise, go, thy faith saved thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Pharisees having asked him, when the
  kingdom of God is to come, he answered them, and said: 'The kingdom of God
  was not to come with (lit. in) observation: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> neither will they say that it is here, or it is
  there; for behold, the kingdom of God (is) inside of you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he said to his disciples: Days come, when ye
  will desire to see one of the days of (the) Son of (the) man, and ye shall
  not see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they shall say to you:
  "Lo, he is there, or he is here:" go not, nor run: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> as the lightning manifesteth itself in (the)
  heaven, and giveth light below (the) heaven: this is as (the) Son of (the)
  man will be in his day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But first he
  must suffer much, and this generation reject him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And according as it was in the days of Noe, thus
  will it be in the days of (the) Son of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> They were eating, and they were drinking, they
  were taking wives, they were taking husbands, until the day (in) which Noe
  went into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed every one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> As again it was in the days of Lot; they were
  eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were
  planting, they were building; <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> but in
  the day (in) which Lot came from Sodom, he rained fire and brimstone from
  (the) heaven, and destroyed every one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> According to these same (things) again it is to
  be in the day in which (the) Son of (the) man will be revealed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And in that day he who is upon (the) housetop,
  and his goods being in the house, make him not come down to take them away:

  back. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Remember (the) wife of Lot.

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he was speaking (lit, saying) a
  parable to them for their praying always, and that they should not faint,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> saying: There was a judge in a city,
  he feareth not before God, and he is not ashamed before [the] men:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and there was a widow in that city;
  and she was coming to him, saying: "Avenge me of him who offereth me
  violence." <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he was not wishing (to
  do it) for (lit. until) a time: but after these (things) he said in himself:
  "Let it be that I fear not before God, and am not ashamed before [the] men;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because that this widow troubleth me,
  I will avenge her, that she may not come until the end (lit, out) troubling
  me."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord said: Hear what the
  judge of [the] unrighteousness saith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And will not God avenge his chosen, these who cry to him in the day and the
  night, and he is long-suffering over them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Yea, I say to you, that he will avenge them
  quickly. But if (the) Son of (the) man should come, will he then find (the)
  faith upon the earth? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He said
  concerning some, who said of (lit. to) themselves that (they) were righteous,
  and (were) despising also the rest, this parable, saying: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one
  was a Pharisee, the other was a publican. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Pharisee having stood was praying these
  (things) in himself: "God, I give thanks to thee that I am not as (the) rest
  of the men, extortioners, violent, adulterous, or even as this publican.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I fast twice a week; I give (the)
  tenth of all things which I get." <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  the publican, standing afar off, was not wishing even to lift his eyes up to
  (the) heaven, but was striking upon (lit. in) his breast, saying: "God
  forgive me, because I (am) a sinner." <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  I say to you, that this (one) went down justified into his house (rather)
  than that (one): because every one who will exalt himself will be humiliated;
  but he who will humiliate himself will be exalted.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they were bringing to him children, that he
  might touch them: but the disciples having seen (it) were rebuking them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But Jesus called them, saying: Permit
  the children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom
  of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Verily I say to you, that he
  who will not receive the kingdom of God to him as this child, shall not come
  into it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And a ruler asked him,
  saying: Good Teacher, what shall (lit. will) I do that I may inherit eternal
  life? <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Jesus said to him:
  Wherefore sayest thou of me: "The good?" there is not any one good except God
  alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou knowest the commandments;
  commit not adultery, kill not, steal not, bear not false witness, honour thy
  father and thy mother.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he said:
  'All these I kept from my childhood.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And Jesus having heard, said to him: Yet (there) is another thing which thou
  lackest: sell all things which thou hast, and distribute them to the poor,
  and thou shalt get for thee a treasure in the heavens, and come, walk after
  me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But he having heard, was
  grieved, for he was very rich. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  Jesus having seen him, said: 'How difficult it is for them who have the
  riches to come into the kingdom of God! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For it is easy that a camel come in through (the)
  eye of the needle, (rather) than that a rich man come into the kingdom of
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they who heard said: For
  whom, indeed, is it possible to be saved?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But he said: "The things impossible for [the] men
  are possible for God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Peter
  said: 'Lo, we laid (down) that we had, we walked after thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he said to them: Verily I say to you, that
  there is not any one who left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or
  sons, because of the kingdom of God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  (but) that he will receive them manifold in this time, and in the age which
  cometh), eternal life.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And having
  brought (close) to him the twelve, he said to them: Lo, we shall (lit. will)
  go up to Jerusalem, and all things will be fulfilled, which are written by
  the prophets concerning (the) Son of (the) man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and he
  will he mocked, and he will be reviled, and they will spit upon him (lit. his
  face): <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> and if they should scourge
  him, they will kill him, and he will rise on the third day.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they understood not any of these (things);
  and the word was (imperf.) hidden from (lit. to) them, and they were not
  knowing the things which he was saying. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And it came to pass (that), he having approached

  asking: 'What is this?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And they told
  him that Jesus of Nazareth (lit. the Nazôreos) passeth. <span style=

  pity me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And they who were walking
  before were rebuking him, that he should hold his peace: but he was rather
  crying out the more: Son of David, pity me.' <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> What wishest thou that I should do to thee?' And
  he said: My Lord, that I may see.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span>
  And Jesus said to him: 'See: thy faith saved thee.' <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But his citizens were hating him, and they sent
  an embassy after (lit. behind) him, saying: "We wish not this (man) to be
  king over us." <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to pass
  (that) having returned, (after) having received the kingdom, he bid them call
  the servants, these to whom he gave the silver, that he might know what
  trading they did. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the first came,
  saying: "My lord, thy pound made ten pounds." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said to him: "Well, good servant, because
  that thou wast faithful in little things. be thou having authority over ten
  cities." <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the second came, saying:
  "My lord, thy pound made five pounds." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he said again to this (one) also: "Be thou
  too over five cities." <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the other
  came, saying: "My lord, behold, thy pound, it is with me; I wrapped it in a
  napkin: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I was fearing thee, because
  thou (art) a hard man: thou takest up that which thou laidst not down, and
  thou reapest that which thou sowedst not." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He said to him: "From thy mouth I will judge
  thee, Wicked servant. If thou knowest that I (am) a hard man, taking up that
  which I laid not down, and reaping that which I sowed not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> wherefore gavest thou not my silver to the bank,
  and if I should come, I should have required it with its increase?"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he said to them who stood (by):
  "Take away the pound from this (man), and give it to him who hath the ten
  pounds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I say to you, that to every one who hath, it
  shall be given; but from him who hath not, that which he hath will be taken
  away from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But my enemies, these
  who wished not me to be king over them, bring them here, and slaughter them
  before me." ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And having said these
  (things), he was walking on before, going up to Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And it came to pass, (that) having approached
  Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain which they call, Of the Olives,' he
  sent two of his disciples, <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> saying: Go
  to this village which is in front of you; ye will find a colt tied, upon
  which no man ever mounted: loose him, bring him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And if any one should ask you wherefore ye loose
  him, say thus: "The Lord hath need of him."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they, who were sent, having gone, found
  according as he said to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And (as
  they are) loosing the colt, his masters said to them: Wherefore loose ye the
  colt?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they said: The Lord hath
  need of him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they brought him to
  Jesus: and having cast forth their garments upon the colt, they placed Jesus
  on him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And (as they are) walking
  they were spreading their garments on the road. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And (as he is) about to approach now the place of
  coming down of the mountain of the Olives, all the multitude of the disciples
  began rejoicing, blessing God with a loud voice concerning all the mighty
  works which they saw; <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> saying: Blessed
  is the King who cometh in (the) name of the Lord: peace in (the) heaven, and
  glory in the highest.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And some of
  the Pharisees from the multitude said to him: Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And he answered, he said: I say to
  you, that if these should hold their peace, these stones will cry out.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And when he approached, having seen
  the city, he wept over it, <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> saying: If
  thou even wert knowing in this day the things of thy peace! but now they were
  hid from thine eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Because days
  will come upon thee, and thine enemies will enclose thee with a palisade, and
  they will surround thee, and they will press thee on every side, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and they shall hurl thee down, and thy sons in
  thee; and they shall not leave a stone upon a stone in thee; because that
  thou knewest not (the) time of thy visitation.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And having entered the temple, he began to cast
  out them who sold, <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> saying to them: '
  It is written, that my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye made it a
  cave of robbers.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And he was teaching
  daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the first of
  the people were seeking to destroy him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> and they were not finding that which they will
  do; for all the people were hanging upon him, hearing him.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in one of the
  days, (that as he is) teaching in the temple, and preaching good tidings, the
  chief priests and the scribes and the elders stood; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and they said to him: 'Say to us, with what
  authority didst thou these things? or who gave this authority to thee?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He answered, he said to them I will
  also ask you a word, and say it to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  The baptism of John, was it from (the) heaven or from [the] men?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they took counsel with one
  another, saying: If we should say, that it is from (the) heaven, he will say:
  "Wherefore believed ye him not?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  if we should say, that it is from [the] men, all the people will stone us,
  for they are persuaded that John is a prophet.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they answered: We know not whence it is.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Jesus said to them: Neither will I
  say to you with what authority I did these things.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he began to speak to the people this parable:
  There was a man who planted a vineyard, and gave it to husbandmen, and went
  to (the) foreign (land) for a long time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And in (the) time he sent a servant to the
  husbandmen, that they might give to him of (the) fruit of the vineyard: but
  the husbandmen having beaten him, thrust him away empty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And further (lit. he added to) again he sent to
  them another servant: and they having beaten this (lit. the) other (one), and
  having reviled him, thrust him away empty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And further (lit. he added to) again be sent the
  third; and they wounded this other (one), they cast him out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord of the vineyard said: "What shall
  (lit. will) I do? I shall (lit. will) send my beloved son: perhaps they may
  be ashamed before him." <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the
  husbandmen having seen him, were taking counsel with one another, saying:
  "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be for
  us." <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And having cast him outside of
  the vineyard, they killed him. What will the Lord of the vineyard do to them?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He will come, and will destroy the
  husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.' And having heard, they
  said: 'It shall not be.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But he
  having gazed at them, said: 'What is this which is written, that the stone
  which the builders rejected, this was made for a completion of (the) corner?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Every one who will fall upon that
  stone will be broken to pieces; but upon whom it will fall, it will scatter
  him as dust.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the scribes and the
  chief priests were seeking to lay (lit. bring) their hands upon him, even
  (lit. and) in that hour; and they feared the people: for they knew that he
  spake (lit. said) this parable concerning them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having observed (him), they sent to him men
  of subtlety, using hypocrisy, saying of themselves that (they were)
  righteous, that they might catch him by word, so as to give him to the rule
  and the authority of the governor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that thou speakest rightly and
  teachest, and acceptest not person, but truly teachest the road of God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> is it lawful to give tax to (the)
  king, or not?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But having observed
  their craftiness, he said: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Shew to me
  a stater.' And they shewed to him. And he said to them: The image and the
  superscription which are on it--whose are they?' And they said: (The) king's
  are they.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he said to them: Now
  give (the) king's (things) to (the) king, and give God's (things) to God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they could not overpower him in a
  word before the people: and having wondered at his answerings, they held
  their peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And some (men), namely,
  Sadducees, who say that there is not resurrection, having come, asked him,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us,
  that if (the) brother of any one should die having wife, and this (man) have
  no son, [that] his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his
  brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> There were then seven
  brothers: and the first having taken the wife died, being without son.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the second took her; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and the third; and thus unto the seventh; they
  left not son, and they died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And at
  (the) end the woman also herself died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> In the resurrection then, of which of them is she
  to be the wife? for the seven took her for wife.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jesus said to them: The sons of this age take
  (to wife) and are taken: <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> but they who
  were worthy of that age, and the resurrection [the] from the dead, neither
  take, nor are taken (to wife): <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> for
  neither is it possible that they should die any more: for they are equal to
  angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But that the dead will rise, Moses also gave sign
  in the (place concerning) the bush, as he saith: "The Lord, God of Abraam,
  and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob." <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  God is not (the God) of them who are dead, but of them who are alive; for all
  are alive to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And some of the
  scribes answered, they said: Teacher, thou saidst well.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> For they were not able to dare any more to ask
  him anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he said to them:
  How say they, that Christ is (the) son of David? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> For David himself saith in (the) book of the
  Psalms: "The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> until I put thine enemies below thy feet.'"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> David then calleth him "My Lord," so
  (lit. and) how is he his son?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And
  all the people hearing (it), he said to his disciples: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Beware of the scribes, who wish to walk in robes,
  and (are) loving the salutations in the market-places, and the first sittings
  in the synagogues, and the first places in the feasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Who eat the houses of the widows, and in pretence
  prolonged they pray: these shall receive more judgement.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having gazed up, he saw rich
  men throwing their gifts into the treasuries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He saw a poor widow also throwing thither two
  mites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said: 'Truly I say to
  you, that this poor widow threw (more) than all these: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> for these threw the gifts from their superfluity:
  this (one), she, from her deficiency, threw all her living which she had
  (import.). <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And (as) some (are) saying
  concerning the temple, that it was garnished with (lit. down in) good stones
  and offerings, he said: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye see all
  these (things): days come in (which) a stone will not be left upon a stone
  here, (which) will not be pulled down."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they asked him: Teacher, when will these
  (things) happen? and what is the sign, if these (things) should be going to
  happen?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he said: Take heed, go
  not astray: for there are many (who) will come in (lit. to) my name, saying:
  "I am (he). And (the) time approached." Walk not behind them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And when ye should hear wars and tumults, be not
  frightened; but not immediately is the end.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then he was saying to them: Nation shall rise
  upon nation, and kingdom upon kingdom: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and great earthquakes shall be, and there shall
  be famines and deaths in different places; and fears and great signs shall be
  from (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But before all
  these (things) they shall lay (lit. bring) their hands upon you, and they
  will persecute you, delivering you to synagogues and prisons, bringing you to
  the kings and the governors because of my name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it (lit. he) shall be to you for a witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Set it then in your hearts, not to
  meditate beforehand what ye will answer: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for I will give to you a mouth and a wisdom,
  which all, who are against you, will not be able to oppose, nor will they be
  able to contradict it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But ye will be
  delivered (up) by parents, and brothers, and kinsfolk, and friends; and they
  will kill (some) of you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And ye shall
  be hated by all (lit, be, all hating you) because of my name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And a hair of your head shall not perish.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And in your patience ye (are)
  possessing your souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> When ye should
  see Jerusalem (with) soldiers surrounding her, then know that her desolation
  approached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Then they who are in
  Judea let them flee upon the mountains; and they who are in her midst let
  them flee out; and they who are in the countries make them not enter her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Because these are the days of (the)
  vengeance, for all things which are written to be fulfilled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But woe to them who are with child, and them who
  give suck in those days! for great distress shall be upon (the) earth, and
  anger for this people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they shall
  fall by (lit. in) the edge (lit. mouth) of (the) sword, and they shall be led
  captive to all the Gentiles: and Jerusalem shall be trodden upon by Gentiles
  (lit. Gentiles treading upon her), until times be fulfilled; and there shall
  be times of Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And there shall
  be signs in (the) sun, and the moon, and the stars; and tribulation of
  nations shall be upon the earth, in perplexity for (the) voice of the sea and
  (the) storm; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> men (with) their heart
  (lit, soul) failing (lit. coming from) them from (the) fear, and (the)
  expectation of the things which come upon the world: for the powers of the
  heavens will be shaken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And they
  shall see (the) Son of (the) man coming in a cloud with power and great
  glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But (as) these (things) are
  about to begin to happen, look up, and raise your heads; because your
  redemption approacheth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he spake
  (lit. said) a parable to them: See the fig-tree and all the trees:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> if now they (are) about to unloose
  (their leaves), seeing by them, ye know that the summer approached.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thus ye also, if ye should see these
  (things) about to happen, know that the kingdom of God approached.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Verily I say to you, that this
  generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> (The) heaven and (the) earth will
  pass away: but my words shall not pass away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But give heed to yourselves, lest haply your
  hearts be heavy in surfeitings, and drunkenness (plur.), and cares of life,
  and suddenly that day come upon you <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  as a snare: for it shall come upon all who are (lit. sit) upon (the) face of
  all (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Watch then always,
  praying that ye may be able to escape all these things which will happen, and
  stand before (the) Son of (the) man.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  And he was spending (lit. doing) the days, teaching in the temple; and the
  nights he was coming forth, resting himself upon the mountain which is
  called, 'of the Olives.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And all the
  people were (coming) early to him in the temple to hear him.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke22">22</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now (the) feast of the unleavened
  was approaching, which is called, 'the Passover.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking
  in what manner they are to destroy him; for they were fearing the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Satan entered (the) heart of Judas
  who is called, '(the) Iscariot,' being of the twelve. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he went, he spake to the chief priests and the
  captains concerning (the) manner to deliver him to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they rejoiced, and they settled with him to
  give to him silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he consented,
  and he was seeking for opportunity that he might deliver him to them without
  multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the day of the
  unleavened came, in which the passover must be slain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he sent Peter and John, (saying): 'Go, prepare
  the passover for us, that we may eat it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they said to him: 'Where wishest thou to
  prepare it <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he said to them: 'Lo,
  (as ye are) about to go into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher
  of water; walk after him to the house which he will enter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And say to the owner [of house] of the house:
  "The Teacher said to thee: Which is the place in which I shall (lit. will)
  eat my passover with my disciples?'" <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And that (man) will show to you a great room (lit. place) aloft, spread;
  prepare it there.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And having gone,
  they found according as he said to them, and they prepared the passover.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the hour came, he sat down to
  meat, and the twelve apostles with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to them: With (lit. in) desire I
  desired to eat my passover with you before I suffer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I say to you, that I shall not eat it, until it
  be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And having taken a cup, he gave thanks, he said: Take this, divide it among
  you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> for I say to you, that I shall
  not drink henceforth of (the) fruit of this vine, until the kingdom of God
  come.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having taken bread, he
  gave thanks, he brake it, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body which
  will be given for you: this do for my remembrance.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the cup likewise (lit. thus again) after the
  supper, saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood for you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But lo, (the) hand of him who will
  deliver me (up) is with me upon the table. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Because (the) Son of (the) man indeed will go
  according as it is appointed: but woe to that man by whom he will be
  delivered (up)!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they began to
  ask of (lit. with) one another, which then of them will do this. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And there was again a contention among them,
  which of them is the great (one). <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles are lords to them; and they who
  are in authority over them are called, "the benefactors." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But ye (are) not thus: but the great (one) who is
  among you--let him be as the young man; and the chief as the minister (lit.
  deacon). <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For which is the great
  (one), he that sitteth down to meat or he that serveth (lit. is deacon)? Is
  not he who sitteth down to meat? I am in your midst as he who serveth (lit.
  is deacon). <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But ye (are) they who
  stayed with me in my temptations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> I
  also will establish with you according as my Father established with me a
  kingdom, <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> that ye may eat and drink at
  my table in my kingdom; and sitting upon thrones ye shall judge the twelve
  tribes of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Simon, Simon,
  behold, Satan shall ask for you to sift you as the wheat: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> but I prayed for thee, that thy faith might not
  fail: and thou also return at once, strengthen thy brothers.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he said to him: Lord, I am prepared to go to
  (the) prison with thee and (the) death.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he said to him: 'I say to thee, Peter, that a
  cock shall not crow to-day, until thou deniest me three times, that thou
  knowest.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he said to them: When I
  sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoe, were ye in want of anything?'
  And they said: 'No (lit. of that).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  And he said to them: ' But now he who hath a purse, let him take it up, thus
  again a scrip: and he who hath not, let him sell his garment, let him buy a
  sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For I say to you, that that
  which is written must be fulfilled in me: He was numbered with the
  transgressors:" for that which is written concerning me hath its end.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And they said: 'Lord, lo, two swords
  (are) here.' And he said to them: They suffice.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having come forth, he went, according to the
  custom, to the mountain of the Olives; and the disciples also walked after
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And having come to the place, he
  said to them: Pray that ye shall come not to temptation.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he separated from them about a stone's cast
  (lit. the space to cast a stone forth); and having thrown himself upon his
  knees, he prayed, <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> saying: 'My Father,
  if thou wishest, let the cup pass from me: but not my will, but let thine be
  done.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And
  having risen from the prayer, he came to the disciples, he found them
  sleeping for (lit. from the) grief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span>
  And he said to them: 'Wherefore sleep ye? rise, pray that ye may not come
  into temptation.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> (As he is) yet
  speaking, behold a multitude, and he who is called, 'Judas,' one of the
  twelve, was walking before them, and he approached Jesus, he kissed his
  mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And Jesus said to him: Judas,
  art thou to deliver (up the) Son of (the) man with a kiss?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And they who were around him, having seen that
  which happened, said: 'Lord, (wilt thou) that we strike with (the) sword?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And one of them struck at (the)
  servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Jesus answered, he said: It is sufficient
  thus far (lit. until here).' And having touched his ear, he cured him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And Jesus said to them who came at
  him, the chief priests, and the captains of the temple, and the elders: 'Came
  ye out, as coming at a robber with staves? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Being in the temple with you daily, ye stretched
  not (out) your hands upon me: but this is your hour, and (the) authority of
  (the) darkness.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And having laid hold
  on him, they brought him, and took him into (the) house of the chief priest.
  Peter was walking after him afar off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span>
  And (they) having lighted a fire in (the) midst of the court, and having sat,
  Peter also was sitting in their midst. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And a young maid servant having seen him sitting
  by the light, and having gazed, said: This (man) also was (imperf.) with
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> But he denied, saying: I know
  him not, Woman.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And after another
  little (time), another having seen him, said: Thou (art) of them also.' But
  Peter said: 'Man, I am not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And
  (the) space of an hour having been, another was affirming of him, saying: 'In
  truth this (man) also was (imperf.) with him: for (he) is a Galilæan.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> But Peter said: Man, I know not that
  which thou sayest.' And immediately, (as he is) yet speaking, a cock crew.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And the Lord, having turned himself,
  gazed at Peter. And Peter remembered (the) word of the Lord, as he said to
  him: Before a cock crow to-day, thou wilt deny me three times.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And having come forth, he wept bitterly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And the men, who were laying hold on
  him, were mocking him, beating him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span>
  And having covered him, they were asking him, saying: Prophesy to us, who
  beat thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And many other things
  they were saying against him, blaspheming. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And the day having come, the elders of the people
  and the chief priests and the scribes assembled, and brought him into their
  council, <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> saying: If thou art Christ,
  say to us.' He said to them: If I should say to you, ye will not believe:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> and if I also should ask you, ye will
  not answer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> Henceforth (the) Son of
  (the) man shall be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> And they all said: Art thou then
  (the) Son of God?' And he said to them: Ye say that I am.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(71)</span> And they said: (Are) we having further need of
  witness? For we ourselves heard (it) from his mouth.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And their whole multitude rose,
  they brought him to Pilate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they
  began to accuse him, saying: This (man) we found, who perverteth our nation,
  and (is) forbidding to give tax to (the) king, saying of himself: "I am
  Christ (the) king." ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Pilate asked
  him, saying: Art thou (the) king of the Jews?' And he answered Thou sayest.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Pilate said to the chief priests
  and the multitudes: 'I find not any fault in this man.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But they were more urgent (lit. finding power),
  saying: He troubleth the people, teaching in all Judea, having begun from
  Galilee unto this place.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But Pilate,
  having heard, was asking whether this man is a Galilæan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And having known that he was (lit. is) under (lit.
  from) (the) authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, he also being in
  Jerusalem in those days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now Herod,
  having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly: for he was wishing to see him for (lit.
  from) much time, because that he was hearing concerning him; and he was
  hoping to see a sign done by him (lit. from him doing it). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he was asking him with many words; but he
  answered not anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The chief
  priests and the scribes were standing accusing him greatly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Herod with his soldiers having reviled him,
  and having mocked him, arrayed him in gorgeous raiment, he sent him to
  Pilate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Pilate and Herod became
  friends to one another in that day: for before they were (imperf.) in enmity
  to one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Pilate, having
  called the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> said to them: Ye brought to me this man, as
  perverting the people: and lo, I, having examined him before you, found not
  any fault in this man as to the things in which ye accuse him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But neither Herod also: for he sent him to us and
  lo, there is not any work in him, which he did, being worthy of (the) death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> (Let) me chastise (lit. teach) him
  then, and release him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But all the multitude cried out: 'Take away this
  (man), release Barabbas to us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This
  (man was one) who was cast into (the) prison because of a tumult and a murder
  having happened in the city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  again Pilate called them, wishing to release Jesus: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but they cried out, saying: 'Crucify him, crucify
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he said to them (the) third
  time: 'Why, what evil did this (man)? I found not any cause of (the) death in
  him; (let) me chastise (lit. teach) him then, and release him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But they persisted with loud voices, asking him
  that he might be crucified. And their voices were more urgent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Pilate gave judgement that their request
  should be done. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he released him
  who was cast into (the) prison because of a murder and tumult, whom they
  asked (for); but Jesus he delivered (up) according to their wish.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And as they (are) bringing him forth,
  they laid hold on one (named) 'Simon,' a Cyrenian, coming from (the) field;
  they placed the cross upon him, to carry (lit. raise) it behind him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And a great multitude of the people
  was walking after him, and women who were lamenting and were wailing for him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But Jesus, having turned himself to
  them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me, but weep over
  yourselves, and over your sons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Because lo, days come, in which they will say: "Blessed are the barren, and
  the wombs which bare not, and the breasts which fed not." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Then they will begin to say to the mountains:
  "Fall upon us;" and the hills: "Cover us." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Because if they do these (things) in the green
  (lit. moist) tree, what will be done in the withered?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they were bringing two malefactors also with
  him to kill them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And having come
  upon the place which is called, the skull,' they crucified him there, and the
  malefactors, one indeed on the right hand, and one on the left hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they divided his garments among
  them, they cast lot for them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the
  people were (sing.) standing, seeing (it). And the rulers also were deriding,
  saying: He saved others; let him save himself also; if this is Christ (the)
  Son of God, the chosen.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the
  soldiers also were mocking him; coming to him, they brought vinegar to him,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> saying: If thou art (the) king of the
  Jews, save thyself.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And there was
  also a superscription over him: 'This is (the) king of the Jews.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And one of the malefactors, who were
  crucified with him, blasphemed him, saying: Art not thou Christ? Save
  thyself, and save us also.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But the
  other answered, he rebuked him, he said: Fearest thou not even God, because
  we were in this one judgement? <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And we
  indeed justly; having received according to (what was, lit. the) worthy of
  the things which we did: but this (man) did not anything evil.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he was saying: Jesus, remember me when thou
  shouldest come in thy kingdom.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And
  he said: Verily I say to thee, that to-day thou shalt be with me in the
  Paradise.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And it was now (the) sixth
  hour, and darkness happened upon all (the) earth until (the) ninth hour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And the sun being about to fail, the
  veil of the temple was rent in its midst. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Jesus, having called with a great voice,
  said: 'My Father, I give my spirit into thy hands:' and having said this, he
  gave (up) the spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the
  centurion, having seen that which happened, was glorifying God, saying:
  Really was this man righteous.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And
  all the multitudes who came upon this sight, having seen the things which
  happened, returned striking their breast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And all his acquaintance were standing afar off,
  and women also, who walked after him from Galilee, seeing these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And behold, a man, his name being
  Joseph, being a councillor, being a good man and righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> This (man) was not agreeing in their counsel and
  their deed. He was of AriMatthewheas, a city of the Jews, (one) who was
  looking for the kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> This
  (man), having come to Pilate, asked (for) the body of Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And having brought him down, he wrapped him in a
  linen cloth, and laid him in a sepulchre, which he hewed (in rock), in
  (which) they laid not yet any one: and he rolled a great stone against (the)
  door of the sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And it was a
  day of Preparation. And (the) beginning (lit. early) of (the) sabbath had
  happened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And the women who came with
  him from Galilee, having walked after him, saw the sepulchre, and the manner
  in which his body was laid. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And
  having returned, they prepared spices and ointments: and (during) the sabbath
  indeed they rested according to the commandment.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._luke24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> On (the) first (lit. one) of the
  sabbaths, very early, they came to the sepulchre, having brought the spices,
  which they prepared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And they found
  the stone having been rolled outside of the sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And having entered, they found not (the) body of
  (the) Lord Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it came to pass
  (as they are) being perplexed concerning this, behold, two men stood above
  them in dazzling raiment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having
  been in fear, and bowing their face to (the) earth, they said to them:
  Wherefore seek ye for the living with the dead? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He is not here, but he rose. Remember, as he spake
  to you, yet being in Galilee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> saying:
  "(The) Son of (the) man must be given into (the) hands of sinful men, and be
  crucified, and rise on the third day." <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And they remembered his words, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and
  having returned from the sepulchre, they told all these (things) to the
  eleven, and all the rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it was
  Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, :and (the) rest who were
  with them, who were saying these (things) to the apostles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And these words appeared before them as idle
  talk, and they were believing them not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But Peter rose, he ran to the sepulchre; and
  having gazed in, he saw the garments alone, and went to his house, wondering
  at that which happened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And behold,
  two of them were walking on that day, going to a village distant from
  Jerusalem about sixty stadia, its name being Emmaûs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they were speaking to one another concerning
  all these (things) which happened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And it came to pass, (that as they are) speaking and questioning (lit.
  seeking), Jesus also himself approached them, he walked with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But their eyes were held (imperf. so
  as) not to know him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said to
  them: What are these words, which ye say with one another, (as ye are)
  walking?' And they stood, being saddened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And one, his name being Kleopas, answered, he
  said to him: Thou alone art in Jerusalem, and thou knewest not the things
  which happened in it in these days?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And he said to them: What are (they)?' And they said to him: The things which
  happened to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man--(a) prophet, being powerful in
  (the) work and (the) word before God and all the people; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and how the chief priests and the rulers gave him
  to judgement of (the) death, and they crucified him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But we hoped that this (man) will redeem Israel.
  But beside all these (things), this is his third day since these (things)
  happened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But beside, some women also
  of us made us wonder. Having gone to the sepulchre early; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and having not found his body, they came, saying:
  "We saw a vision of angels, who say of him that he is alive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And some of us went to the sepulchre, they found
  as the women also said: but him they saw not."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he said to them: O [the] senseless, and slow
  in [their] heart to believe all things which the prophets spake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Was it not (imperf.) laid (down) that Christ
  should suffer these (pains), and enter his glory?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And having begun from Moses and all the prophets,
  he was interpreting to them what were the things which were in all the
  scriptures concerning him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they
  approached to the village, to which they were to go: and he made as going
  further (in) walking. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they were
  laying hold on him violently, saying: Stay with us: because (it is) evening,
  and now the day declined.' And he came in that he might stay with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And it came to pass, (that) having
  sat down to meat with them, having taken the bread, he blessed it, and having
  broken it, he was giving to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And
  they--their eyes opened, and they knew him; and he disappeared from them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they said to one another Was not
  our heart burning in us, as he is speaking to us in the road, manifesting the
  scriptures to us?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they rose in
  that hour, they returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven assembled,
  and them who were with them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> saying:
  `Really the Lord rose, and manifested himself to Simon.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they were speaking of the things which were
  (done) in the road, and how he appeared to them in the breaking of the bread.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And (as they are) speaking of these
  (things), Jesus himself stood in their midst, and said to them: 'The peace to
  you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But they having been troubled,
  and having been in fear, were thinking that they saw (lit. see) a spirit.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he said to them: Wherefore are ye
  troubled, and wherefore come thoughts upon your hearts? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> See my hands and my feet, that (it) is I: handle
  me, and see; because there is not spirit having flesh and bone, according as
  ye see me having.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And having said
  this, he shewed to them his hands and his feet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And (as they are) yet unbelieving for (lit. from
  [the]) joy, and wondering, he said to them: 'Have ye something to eat here?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And they gave to him part of a boiled
  fish, and a honey-comb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And having
  taken (it) before them, he ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And
  he said to them: 'These were my words which I said to you, being yet with
  you; that all things which are written in (the) law of Moses, and the
  prophets, and the psalms, concerning me, must be fulfilled.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Then he opened their heart to make them
  understand the scriptures; and he said to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> It was written thus for Christ to suffer, and
  rise from the dead on the third day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span>
  and repentance be preached in his name for (the) forgiveness of sins in all
  the nations. Having begun from Jerusalem, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> ye bear witness of these (things). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And I will send the promise of my Father upon
  you: but sit ye in the city, until ye receive power from (the) height.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And he brought them out unto Bethany:
  and having lifted his hands up, he blessed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And it came to pass in his blessing them, he
  separated away from them, and was (imperf.) taken up to (the) heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And they having worshipped him,
  returned to Jerusalem with great joy: <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span>
  and they were (imperf.) always in the temple blessing God.</p>
