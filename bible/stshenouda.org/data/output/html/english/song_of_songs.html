  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Song of songs, which is Solomon’
   s. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of
  his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the smell of thine ointments is better than
  all spices: thy name is ointment poured forth; therefore do the young maidens
  love thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They have drawn thee: we
  will run after thee, for the smell of thine ointments: the king has brought
  me into closet: let us rejoice and be glad in thee; we will love thy breasts
  more than wine: righteousness loves thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I am black, but beautiful, ye daughters of
  Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the
  sun has looked unfavourably upon me: my mother’s sons strove with me; they
  made me keeper in the vineyards; I have not kept my own vineyard.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Tell me, thou whom my soul loves,
  where thou tendest thy flock, where thou causest them to rest at noon, lest I
  become as one that is veiled by the flocks of thy companions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If thou know not thyself, thou fair one among
  women, go thou forth by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed thy kids by the
  shepherd’s tents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I have likened thee,
  my companion, to my horses in the chariots of Pharao. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> How are thy cheeks beautiful as those of a dove,
  thy neck as chains! <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> We will make thee
  figures of gold with studs of silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  So long as the king was at table, my spikenard gave forth its smell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My kinsman is to me a bundle of
  myrrh; he shall lie between my breasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> My kinsman is to me a cluster of camphor in the
  vineyards of Engaddi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Behold, thou
  art fair, my companion; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Behold, thou art fair, my kinsman,
  yea, beautiful, overshadowing our bed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The beams of our house are cedars, our ceilings
  are of cypress.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I am a flower of the plain, a lily
  of the valleys. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> As a lily among
  thorns, so is my companion among the daughters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> As the apple among the trees of the wood, so is my
  kinsman among the sons. I desired his shadow, and sat down, and his fruit was
  sweet in my throat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Bring me into the
  wine house; set love before me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Strengthen me with perfumes, stay me with apples: for I am wounded with love.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> His left hand shall be under my head,
  and his right hand shall embrace me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I
  have charged you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues
  of the field, that ye do not rouse or wake my love, until he please.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The voice of my kinsman! behold, he
  comes leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> My kinsman is like a roe or a young hart on the
  mountains of Baethel: behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the
  windows, peeping through the lattices. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> My kinsman answers, and says to me, Rise up,
  come, my companion, my fair one, my dove. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For, behold, the winter is past, the rain is
  gone, it has departed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The flowers
  are seen in the land; the time of pruning has arrived; the voice of the
  turtle-dove has been heard in our land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The fig-tree has put forth its young figs, the
  vines put forth the tender grape, they yield a smell: arise, come, my
  companion, my fair one, my dove; yea, come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou art my dove, in the shelter of the rock,
  near the wall: shew me thy face, and cause me to hear thy voice; for thy
  voice is sweet, and thy countenance is beautiful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Take us the little foxes that spoil the vines:
  for our vines put forth tender grapes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> My kinsman is mine, and I am his: he feeds his
  flock among the lilies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Until the day
  dawn, and the shadows depart, turn, my kinsman, be thou like to a roe or
  young hart on the mountains of the ravines.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> By night on my bed I sought him
  whom my soul loves: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he
  hearkened not to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I will rise now,
  and go about in the city, in the market-places, and in the streets, and I
  will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The watchmen who go their rounds in
  the city found me. I said, Have ye seen him whom my soul loves? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> It was as a little while after I parted from them,
  that I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and did not let him go,
  until I brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that
  conceived me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I have charged you, O
  daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that
  ye rouse not nor awake my love, until he please. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Who is this that comes up from the wilderness as
  pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of
  the perfumer? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold Solomon’s bed;
  sixty mighty men of the mighty ones of Israel are round about it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They all hold a sword, being expert in
  war: every man has his sword upon his thigh because of fear by night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> King Solomon made himself a litter of
  woods of Lebanon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He made the pillars
  of it silver, the bottom of it gold, the covering of it scarlet, in the midst
  of it a pavement of love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and behold king
  Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him, in the day of his
  espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Behold, thou art fair, my
  companion; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves, beside thy veil: thy
  hair is as flocks of goats, that have appeared from Galaad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn sheep, that have
  gone up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and there is not a
  barren one among them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thy lips are as
  a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: like the rind of a pomegranate
  is thy cheek without thy veil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thy
  neck is as the tower of David, that was built for an armoury: a thousand
  shields hang upon it, and all darts of mighty men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns, that feed
  among the lilies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Until the day dawn,
  and the shadows depart, I will betake me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the
  hill of frankincense. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou art all
  fair, my companion, and there is no spot in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Come from Libanus, my bride, come from Libanus:
  thou shalt come and pass from the top of Faith, from the top of Sanir and
  Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> My sister, my spouse, thou hast
  ravished my heart; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with
  one chain of thy neck. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> How beautiful
  are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! how much more beautiful are thy
  breasts than wine, and the smell of thy garments than all spices!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thy lips drop honeycomb, my spouse:
  honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is as the
  smell of Libanus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> My sister, my
  spouse is a garden enclosed; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thy shoots are a garden of
  pomegranates, with the fruit of choice berries; camphor, with spikenard:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> spikenard and saffron, calamus and
  cinnamon; with all woods of Libanus, myrrh, aloes, with all chief spices:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> a fountain of a garden, and a well of
  water springing and gurgling from Libanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Awake, O north wind; and come, O south; and blow
  through my garden, and let my spices flow out.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Let my kinsman come down into his
  garden, and eat the fruit of his choice berries. I am come into my garden, my
  sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices; I have eaten my
  bread with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and
  drink; yea, brethren, drink abundantly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I sleep, but my heart is awake: the voice of my
  kinsman knocks at the door, saying, Open, open to me, my companion, my
  sister, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks
  with the drops of the night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I have
  put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I
  defile them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> My kinsman put forth his
  hand by the hole of the door, and my belly moved for him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I rose up to open to my kinsman; my hands dropped
  myrrh, my fingers choice myrrh, on the handles of the lock. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I opened to my kinsman; my kinsman was gone: my
  soul failed at his speech: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but
  he answered me not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The watchman that
  go their rounds in the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the
  keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by
  the powers and the virtues of the field: if ye should find my kinsman, what
  are ye to say to him? That I am wounded with love. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What is thy kinsman more than another kinsman, O
  thou beautiful among women? what is thy kinsman more than another kinsman,
  that thou hast so charged us? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> My
  kinsman is white and ruddy, chosen out from myriads. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> His head is as very fine gold, his locks are
  flowing, black as a raven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> His eyes
  are as doves, by the pools of waters, washed with milk, sitting by the pools.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> His cheeks are as bowls of spices
  pouring forth perfumes: his lips are lilies, dropping choice myrrh.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> His hands are as turned gold set with
  beryl: his belly is an ivory tablet on a sapphire stone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> His legs are marble pillars set on golden
  sockets: his form is as Libanus, choice as the cedars. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> His throat is most sweet, and altogether
  desirable. This is my kinsman, and this is my companion, O daughters of
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Whither is thy kinsman
  gone, thou beautiful among women? whither has thy kinsman turned aside? tell
  us, and we will seek him with thee.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My kinsman is gone down to his
  garden, to the beds of spice, to feed his flock in the gardens, and to gather
  lilies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I am my kinsman’s, and my
  kinsman is mine, who feeds among the lilies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thou art fair, my companion, as Pleasure,
  beautiful as Jerusalem, terrible as armies set in array. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Turn away thine eyes from before me, for they have
  ravished me: thy hair is as flocks of goats which have appeared from Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn
  sheep, that have gone up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and
  there is none barren among them: thy lips are as a thread of scarlet, and thy
  speech is comely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thy cheek is like
  the rind of a pomegranate, being seen without thy veil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and
  maidens without number. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> My dove, my
  perfect one is one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice of
  her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and the queens will pronounce her
  blessed, yea, and the concubines, and they will praise her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair
  as the moon, choice as the sun, terrible as armies set in array? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I went down to the garden of nuts, to look at the
  fruits of the valley, to see if the vine flowered, if the pomegranates
  blossomed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> There I will give thee my
  breasts: my soul knew it not: it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Return, return, O Sunamite; return,
  return, and we will look at thee. What will ye see in the Sunamite? She comes
  as bands of armies.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thy steps are beautiful in shoes, O
  daughter of the prince: the joints of thy thighs are like chains, the work of
  the craftsman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thy navel is as a
  turned bowl, not wanting liquor; thy belly is as a heap of wheat set about
  with lilies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thy two breasts are as
  two twin fawns. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thy neck is as an
  ivory tower; thine eyes are as pools in Esebon, by the gates of the daughter
  of many: thy nose is as the tower of Libanus, looking toward Damascus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thy head upon thee is as Carmel, and
  the curls of thy hair like scarlet; the king is bound in the galleries.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> How beautiful art thou, and how sweet
  art thou, my love! <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> This is thy
  greatness in thy delights: thou wast made like a palm tree, and thy breasts
  to cluster. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I said, I will go up to
  the palm tree, I will take hold of its high boughs: and now shall thy breasts
  be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose of apples; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and thy throat as good wine, going well with my
  kinsman, suiting my lips and teeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I
  am my kinsman’s, and his desire is toward me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Come, my kinsman, let us go forth into the field;
  let us lodge in the villages. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let us
  go early into the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered, if the
  blossoms have appeared, if the pomegranates have blossomed; there will I give
  thee my breasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The mandrakes have
  given a smell, and at our doors are all kinds of choice fruits, new and old.
  O my kinsman, I have kept them for thee.</p>

  <h3 id="song_of_songs8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I would that thou, O my kinsman,
  wert he that sucked the breasts of my mother; when I found thee without, I
  would kiss thee; yea, they should not despise me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I would take thee, I would bring thee into my
  mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me; I would make
  thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranates. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> His left hand should be under my head, and his
  right hand should embrace me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I have
  charged you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the virtues of the field, that ye
  stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Who is this that comes up all white, leaning on
  her kinsman? I raised thee up under an apple-tree; there thy mother brought
  thee forth; there she that bore thee brought thee forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon
  thine arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave, her
  shafts are shafts of fire, even the flames thereof. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Much water will not be able to quench love, and
  rivers shall not drown it; if a man would give all his substance for love,
  men would utterly despise it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Our
  sister is little, and has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister, in the
  day wherein she shall be spoken for? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  If she is a wall, let us build upon her silver bulwarks; and if she is a
  door, let us carve for her cedar panels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I am a wall, and my breasts are as towers; I was
  in their eyes as one that found peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Solomon had a vineyard in Beelamon; he let his
  vineyard to keepers; every one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces
  of silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> My vineyard, even mine, is
  before me; Solomon shall have a thousand, and they that keep its fruit two
  hundred. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou that dwellest in the
  gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: make me hear it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Away, my kinsman, and be like a doe or a fawn on
  the mountains of spices.</p>
