  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A copy of an epistle, which Jeremy
  sent unto them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the
  Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Because of the sins which ye have committed before
  God, ye shall be led away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the
  Babylonians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So when ye be come unto
  Babylon, ye shall remain there many years, and for a long season, namely,
  seven generations: and after that I will bring you away peaceably from
  thence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Now shall ye see in Babylon
  gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause
  the nations to fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Beware therefore
  that ye in no wise be like to strangers, neither be ye and of them, when ye
  see the multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But say ye in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For mine angel is with you, and
  I myself caring for your souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> As for
  their tongue, it is polished by the workman, and they themselves are gilded
  and laid over with silver; yet are they but false, and cannot speak.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And taking gold, as it were for a
  virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for the heads of their gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Sometimes also the priests convey
  from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Yea, they will give thereof to the common
  harlots, and deck them as men with garments, being gods of silver, and gods
  of gold, and wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Yet cannot these
  gods save themselves from rust and moth, though they be covered with purple
  raiment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They wipe their faces
  because of the dust of the temple, when there is much upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he that cannot put to death one that
  offendeth him holdeth a scepter, as though he were a judge of the country.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He hath also in his right hand a
  dagger and an axe: but cannot deliver himself from war and thieves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Whereby they are known not to be
  gods: therefore fear them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For
  like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth when it is broken; even so
  it is with their gods: when they be set up in the temple, their eyes be full
  of dust through the feet of them that come in. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And as the doors are made sure on every side upon
  him that offendeth the king, as being committed to suffer death: even so the
  priests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lest their
  gods be spoiled with robbers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They
  light them candles, yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see
  one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> They are as one of the beams of
  the temple, yet they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping out
  of the earth; and when they eat them and their clothes, they feel it not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Their faces are blacked through the
  smoke that cometh out of the temple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Upon their bodies and heads sit bats, swallows, and birds, and the cats also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> By this ye may know that they are no
  gods: therefore fear them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Notwithstanding the gold that is about them to make them beautiful, except
  they wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were
  molten did they feel it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The things
  wherein there is no breath are bought for a most high price. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> They are borne upon shoulders, having no feet
  whereby they declare unto men that they be nothing worth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> They also that serve them are ashamed: for if
  they fall to the ground at any time, they cannot rise up again of themselves:
  neither, if one set them upright, can they move of themselves: neither, if
  they be bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but they set gifts
  before them as unto dead men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> As for
  the things that are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse; in
  like manner their wives lay up part thereof in salt; but unto the poor and
  impotent they give nothing of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Menstruous women and women in childbed eat their sacrifices: by these things
  ye may know that they are no gods: fear them not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For how can they be called gods? because women
  set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the priests sit in their temples, having
  their clothes rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their
  heads. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> They roar and cry before their
  gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The priests also take off their garments, and
  clothe their wives and children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  Whether it be evil that one doeth unto them, or good, they are not able to
  recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor put him down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> In like manner, they can neither give riches nor
  money: though a man make a vow unto them, and keep it not, they will not
  require it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> They can save no man from
  death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor
  help any man in his distress. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> They
  can shew no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Their gods of wood, and which are overlaid with
  gold and silver, are like the stones that be hewn out of the mountain: they
  that worship them shall be confounded. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> How should a man then think and say that they are
  gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Who if they shall see one dumb that cannot speak,
  they bring him, and intreat Bel that he may speak, as though he were able to
  understand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Yet they cannot
  understand this themselves, and leave them: for they have no knowledge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> The women also with cords about them,
  sitting in the ways, burn bran for perfume: but if any of them, drawn by some
  that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was not
  thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Whatsoever is done among them is false: how may
  it then be thought or said that they are gods? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> They are made of carpenters and goldsmiths: they
  can be nothing else than the workmen will have them to be. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And they themselves that made them can never
  continue long; how should then the things that are made of them be gods?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> For they left lies and reproaches to
  them that come after. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> For when there
  cometh any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves,
  where they may be hidden with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span>
  How then cannot men perceive that they be no gods, which can neither save
  themselves from war, nor from plague? <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>
  For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with silver and gold, it shall
  be known hereafter that they are false: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And it shall manifestly appear to all nations and
  kings that they are no gods, but the works of men's hands, and that there is
  no work of God in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Who then may
  not know that they are no gods? <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> For
  neither can they set up a king in the land, nor give rain unto men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> Neither can they judge their own
  cause, nor redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows between
  heaven and earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> Whereupon when fire
  falleth upon the house of gods of wood, or laid over with gold or silver,
  their priests will flee away, and escape; but they themselves shall be burned
  asunder like beams. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Moreover they
  cannot withstand any king or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that
  they be gods? <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> Neither are those gods
  of wood, and laid over with silver or gold, able to escape either from
  thieves or robbers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> Whose gold, and
  silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong take,
  and go away withal: neither are they able to help themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth
  his power, or else a profitable vessel in an house, which the owner shall
  have use of, than such false gods; or to be a door in an house, to keep such
  things therein, than such false gods. or a pillar of wood in a palace, than
  such false gods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> For sun, moon, and
  stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(61)</span> In like manner the lightning when it breaketh
  forth is easy to be seen; and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every
  country. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And when God commandeth the
  clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are bidden. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And the fire sent from above to consume hills and
  woods doeth as it is commanded: but these are like unto them neither in shew
  nor power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> Wherefore it is neither to
  be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able neither to
  judge causes, nor to do good unto men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear
  them not, <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> For they can neither curse
  nor bless kings: <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> Neither can they
  shew signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give
  light as the moon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> The beasts are
  better than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> It is then by no means manifest unto
  us that they are gods: therefore fear them not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(70)</span> For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers
  keepeth nothing: so are their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and
  gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(71)</span> And likewise their gods of
  wood, and laid over with silver and gold, are like to a white thorn in an
  orchard, that every bird sitteth upon; as also to a dead body, that is east
  into the dark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(72)</span> And ye shall know them
  to be no gods by the bright purple that rotteth upon them: and they
  themselves afterward shall be eaten, and shall be a reproach in the country.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(73)</span> Better therefore is the just man that
  hath none idols: for he shall be far from reproach.</p>
