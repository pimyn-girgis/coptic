  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And one of the wives of the sons of
  the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and
  thou knowest that thy servant feared the Lord: and the creditor is come to
  take my two sons to be his servants. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And Elisaie said, What shall I do for thee? tell me what thou hast in the
  house. And she said, Thy servant has nothing in the house, except oil
  wherewith I anoint myself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said
  to her, Go, borrow for thyself vessels without of all thy neighbours, even
  empty vessels; borrow not a few. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  thou shalt go in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and thou
  shalt pour forth into these vessels, and remove that which is filled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she departed from him, and shut
  the door upon herself and upon her sons: they brought the vessels near to
  her, and she poured in until the vessels were filled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And she said to her sons, Bring me yet a vessel.
  And they said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And she came and told the man of God:
  and Elisaie said, Go, and sell the oil, and thou shalt pay thy debts, and
  thou and thy sons shall live of the remaining oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And a day came, when Elisaie passed over to Soman,
  and there was a great lady there, and she constrained him to eat bread: and
  it came to pass as often as he went into the city, that he turned aside to
  eat there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the woman said to her
  husband, See now, I know that this is a holy man of God who comes over
  continually to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let us now make
  for him an upper chamber, a small place; and let us put there for him a bed,
  and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall come to pass that
  when he comes in to us, he shall turn in thither. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And a day came, and he went in thither, and
  turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said to Giezi his servant, Call me this
  Somanite. and he called her, and she stood before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou
  hast taken all this trouble for us; what should I do for thee? Hast thou any
  request to make to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I
  dwell in the midst of my people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  he said to Giezi, What must we do for her? and Giezi his servant said, Indeed
  she has no son, and her husband is old. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he called her, and she stood by the door.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Elisaie said to her, At this time
  next year, as the season is, thou shalt be alive, and embrace a son. And she
  said, Nay, my lord, do not lie to thy servant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the woman conceived, and bore a son at the
  very time, as the season was, being alive, as Elisaie said to her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the child grew: and it came to
  pass when he went out to his father to the reapers, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> that he said to his father, My head, my head. and
  his father said to a servant, carry him to his mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he carried him to his mother, and he lay upon
  her knees till noon, and died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of god; and she shut
  the door upon him, and went out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And
  she called her husband, and said, Send now for me one of the young men, and
  one of the asses, and I will ride quickly to the man of God, and return.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he said, Why art thou going to
  him to-day? It is neither new moon, nor the Sabbath. And she said, It is
  well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And she saddled the ass, and
  said to her servant, Be quick, proceed: spare not on my account to ride,
  unless I shall tell thee. Go, and thou shalt proceed, and come to the man of
  God to mount Carmel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And she rode and
  came to the man of God to the mountain: and it came to pass when Elisaie saw
  her coming, that he said to Giezi his servant, See now, that Somanite comes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Now run to meet her, and thou shalt
  say, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the
  child? and she said, It is well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And
  she came to Elisaie to the mountain, and laid hold of his feet; and Giezi
  drew near to thrust her away. And Elisaie said, Let her alone, for her soul
  is much grieved in her, and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told
  it me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And she said, Did I ask a son
  of my lord? For did I not say, Do not deal deceitfully with me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Elisaie said to Giezi, Gird up thy loins, and
  take my staff in thy hand, and go: if thou meet any man, thou shalt not
  salute him, and if a man salute thee thou shalt not answer him: and thou
  shalt lay my staff on the child’s face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the mother of the child said, As the Lord
  lives and as thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And Elisaie arose, and
  went after her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Giezi went on
  before her, and laid his staff on the child’s face: but there was neither
  voice nor any hearing. So he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The
  child is not awaked. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Elisaie went
  into the house, and, behold, the dead child was laid upon his bed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Elisaie went into the house, and
  shut the door upon themselves, the two, and prayed to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put
  his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
  hands; and bowed himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he returned, and walked up and
  down in the house: and he went up, and bowed himself on the child seven
  times; and the child opened his eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  And Elisaie cried out to Giezi, and said, Call this Somanite. So he called
  her, and she came in to him: and Elisaie said, Take thy son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the woman went in, and fell at his feet, and
  did obeisance bowing to the ground; and she took her son, and went out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Elisaie returned to Galgala: and
  a famine was in the land; and the sons of the prophets sat before him: and
  Elisaie said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the
  sons of the prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he went out
  into the field to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered
  of it wild gourds, his garment full; and he cast it into the caldron of
  pottage, for they knew them not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And
  he poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, when they were
  eating of the pottage, that lo! they cried out, and said, There is death in
  the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And he said, Take meal, and cast it into the pot.
  And Elisaie said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people, and let them
  eat. And there was no longer there any hurtful thing in the pot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And there came a man over from Baetharisa, and
  brought to the man of God twenty barley loaves and cakes of figs, of the
  first-fruits. And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And his servant said, Why should I set this
  before a hundred men? and he said, Give to the people, and let them eat; for
  thus saith the Lord, They shall eat and leave. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And they ate and left, according to the word of
  the Lord.</p>
