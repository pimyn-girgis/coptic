  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And David made for himself houses
  in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a
  tent for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Then said David, It is
  not lawful for any to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has
  chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And David assembled all Israel at
  Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he had prepared
  for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And David gathered together
  the sons of Aaron the Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Of the
  sons of Caath; there was Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and
  twenty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Of the sons of Merari; Asaia
  the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his
  brethren, a hundred and thirty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Of the
  sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Of the sons of Chebrom; Eliel the
  chief, and his brethren eighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Of
  the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And David called Sadoc and Abiathar
  the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel,
  and Aminadab, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and said to them, Ye
  are the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and
  your brethren, and ye shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel, to the
  place which I have prepared for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  For because ye were not ready at the first, our God made a breach upon us,
  because we sought him not according to the ordinance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> So the priests and the Levites sanctified
  themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God,
  (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their
  shoulders with staves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And David said
  to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical
  instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> So the Levites appointed Æman the son
  of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias was one of his brethren; and Æthan the
  son of Kisaeus was of the sons of Merari their brethren; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and with them their brethren of the second rank,
  Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and
  Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom,
  and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And the singers, Æman, Asaph, and Æthan, with brazen cymbals to make a sound
  to be heard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Zacharias, and Oziel,
  Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasaeas, Banaeas, with lutes, on alaemoth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and
  Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make
  a loud noise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Chonenia chief of
  the Levites was master of the bands, because he was skilful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Barachia and Elcana were door-keepers of the
  ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Somnia, and Josaphat, and
  Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banaea, and Eliezer, the priests,
  were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia were
  door-keepers of the ark of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So
  David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring
  up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And it came to pass when God
  strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that
  they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And David was girt with a fine linen robe, and
  all the Levites who were bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the
  singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David
  there was a robe of fine linen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and
  with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly
  on lutes and harps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the ark of
  the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol
  the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David
  dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>

  <h3 id="first_chronicles16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> So they brought in the ark of God,
  and set it in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it; and
  they offered whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And David finished offering up
  whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name
  of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he divided to every
  man of Israel (both men and women), to every man one baker’s loaf, and a
  cake. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he appointed before the ark
  of the covenant of the Lord, Levites to minister and lift up the voice, and
  to give thanks and praise the Lord God of Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Asaph was the chief, and next to him Zacharias,
  Jeiel, Semiramoth, and Jeiel, Mattathias, Eliab, and Banaeas, and Abdedom:
  and Jeiel sounding with musical instruments, lutes and harps, and Asaph with
  cymbals: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and Banaeas and Oziel the
  priests sounding continually with trumpets before the ark of the covenant of
  God in that day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then David first gave
  orders to praise the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Song. Give thanks to the Lord, call upon him by
  his name, make known his designs among the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Sing songs to him, and sing hymns to him, relate
  to all people his wonderful deeds, which the Lord has wrought. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Praise his holy name, the heart that seeks his
  pleasure shall rejoice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Seek the Lord
  and be strong, seek his face continually. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Remember his wonderful works which he has
  wrought, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> ye seed of Israel his servants, ye seed of Jacob
  his chosen ones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He is the Lord our
  God; his judgments are in all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let us remember his covenant for ever, his word
  which he commanded to a thousand generations, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath
  sworn to Isaac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He confirmed it to
  Jacob for an ordinance, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> saying, To thee will I give the land of Chanaan,
  the line of your inheritance: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> when
  they were few in number, when they were but little, and dwelt as strangers in
  it; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and went from nation to nation,
  and from one kingdom to another people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He suffered not a man to oppress them, and he
  reproved kings for their sakes, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and deal not wrongfully with my prophets.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth;
  proclaim his salvation from day to day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Declare among the nations his glory, his wondrous
  deeds among all peoples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For the Lord
  is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For all the gods of the nations are
  idols; but our God made the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  Glory and praise are in his presence; strength and rejoicing are in his
  place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Give to the Lord, ye families
  of the nations, give to the Lord glory and strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Give to the Lord the glory belonging to his name:
  take gifts and offer them before him; and worship the Lord in his holy
  courts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Let the whole earth fear
  before him; let the earth be established, and not be moved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult;
  and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The sea with its fullness shall resound and the
  tree of the field, and all things in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice before
  the Lord, for he is come to judge the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Give thanks to the Lord, for it is good, for his
  mercy is for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And say ye, Save
  us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and rescue us from among the
  heathen, that we may praise thy holy name, and glory in thy praises.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
  from everlasting and to everlasting: And all the people shall say, Amen. So
  they praised the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And they left
  there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to
  minister before the ark continually, according to the service of each day:
  from day to day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Abdedom and his
  brethren were sixty and eight; and Abdedom the son of Idithun, and Osa, were
  to be door-keepers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And they
  appointed Sadoc the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
  tabernacle of the Lord in the high place in Gabaon, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> to offer up whole-burnt-offerings continually
  morning and evening, and according to all things written in the law of the
  Lord, which he commanded the children of Israel by Moses the servant of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And with him were Æman and Idithun,
  and the rest chosen out by name to praise the Lord, for his mercy endures for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And with them there were
  trumpets and cymbals to sound aloud, and musical instruments for the songs of
  God: and the sons of Idithun were at the gate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And all the people went every one to his home:
  and David returned to bless his house.</p>

  <h3 id="first_chronicles28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And David assembled all the chief
  men of Israel, the chief of the judges, and all the chief men of the courses
  of attendance on the person of the king, and the captains of thousands and
  hundreds, and the treasurers, and the lords of his substance, and of all the
  king’s property, and of his sons, together with the eunuchs, and the mighty
  men, and the warriors of the army, at Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And David stood in the midst of the assembly, and
  said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: it was in my heart to build a
  house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and a place for the
  feet of our Lord, and I prepared materials suitable for the building:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> but God said, Thou shalt not build me
  a house to call my name upon it, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed
  blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yet the Lord God of Israel
  chose me out of the whole house of my father to be king over Israel for ever;
  and he chose Juda as the kingly house, and out of the house of Juda he chose
  the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he preferred me, that
  I should be king over all Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  of all my sons, (for the Lord has given me many sons,)he has chosen Solomon
  my son, to set him on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And God said to me, Solomon thy son
  shall build my house and my court: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
  will be to him a father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will
  establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and
  my judgments, as at this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And now
  I charge you before the whole assembly of the Lord, and in the audience of
  our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, that ye may
  inherit the good land, and leave it for your sons to inherit after you for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And now, my son Solomon, know
  the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing soul:
  for the Lord searches all hearts, and knows every thought: if thou seek him,
  he will be found of thee; but if thou shouldest forsake him, he will forsake
  thee for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> See now, for the Lord
  has chosen thee to build him a house for a sanctuary, be strong and do it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And David gave Solomon his son the
  plan of the temple, and its buildings, and its treasuries, and its upper
  chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of the atonement,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and the plan which he had in his mind
  of the courts of the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about,
  designed for the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the
  holy things, and of the chambers for resting: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and the plan of the courses of the priests and
  Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and of the
  stores of vessels for ministration of the service of the house of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he gave him the account of their
  weight, both of gold and silver vessels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He gave him the weight of the candlesticks, and
  of the lamps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He gave him likewise
  the weight of the tables of shewbread, of each table of gold, and likewise of
  the tables of silver: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> also of the
  flesh-hooks, and vessels for drink-offering, and golden bowls: and the weight
  of the gold and silver articles, and censers, and bowls, according to the
  weight of each. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he shewed him the
  weight of the utensils of the altar of incense, which was of pure gold, and
  the plan of the chariot of the cherubs that spread out their wings, and
  overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> David gave all to Solomon in the Lord’s
  handwriting, according to the knowledge given him of the work of the pattern.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And David said to Solomon his son, Be
  strong, and play the man, and do: fear not, neither be terrified; for the
  Lord my God is with thee; he will not forsake thee, and will not fail thee,
  until thou hast finished all the work of the service of the house of the
  Lord. And behold the pattern of the temple, even his house, and its treasury,
  and the upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of
  propitiation, and the plan of the house of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And see, here are the courses of the priests and
  Levites for all the service of the house of the Lord, and there shall be with
  thee men for every workmanship, and every one of ready skill in every art:
  also the chief men and all the people, ready for all thy commands.</p>

  <h3 id="first_chronicles29">29</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And David the king said to all the
  congregation, Solomon my son, whom the Lord has chosen, is young and tender,
  and the work is great; for it is not for man, but for the Lord God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I have prepared according to all my
  might for the house of my God gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones,
  and costly and variegated stones for setting, and every precious stone, and
  much Parian marble. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And still farther,
  because I took pleasure in the house of my God, I have gold and silver which
  I have procured for myself, and, behold, I have given them to the house of my
  God over and above, beyond what I have prepared for the holy house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Three thousand talents of gold of
  Suphir, and seven thousand talents of fine silver, for the overlaying of the
  walls of the sanctuary: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for thee to
  use the gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for
  every work by the hand of the artificers. And who is willing to dedicate
  himself in work this day for the Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and
  the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the
  works, and the king’s builders, offered willingly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they gave for the works of the house of the
  Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold pieces, and ten
  thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a
  hundred thousand talents of iron. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  they who had precious stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the
  Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the people rejoiced because of the
  willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and
  king David rejoiced greatly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And king
  David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, Blessed art thou, O
  Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and
  the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for thou art Lord
  of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before thy face every
  king and nation is troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> From
  thee come wealth and glory: thou, O Lord, rulest over all, the Lord of all
  dominion, and in thy hand is strength and rule; and thou art almighty with
  thy hand to increase and establish all things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And now, Lord, we give thanks to thee, and praise
  thy glorious name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But who am I, and
  what is my people, that we have been able to be thus forward in offering to
  thee? for all things are thine, and of thine own have we given thee,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for we are strangers before thee, and
  sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days upon the earth are as a shadow,
  and there is no remaining. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> O Lord our
  God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be
  built to thy holy name, it is of thy hand, and all is thine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I know, Lord, that thou art he that searches
  the hearts, and thou lovest righteousness. I have willingly offered all these
  things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy thy people here
  present, willingly offering to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these
  things in the thought of the heart of thy people for ever, and direct their
  hearts to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And to Solomon my son
  give a good heart, to perform thy commandments, and to observe thy
  testimonies, and thine ordinances, and to accomplish the building of thy
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And David said to the whole
  congregation, Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the
  Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord,
  and did obeisance to the king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings to the
  Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a
  thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for
  all Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they ate and drank
  joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David
  king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the
  priesthood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Solomon sat upon the
  throne of his father David, and was highly honoured; and all Israel obeyed
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The princes, and the mighty men,
  and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel,
  and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And David the son of Jessae reigned
  over Israel forty years; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> seven years
  in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he died in a good old age, full of days, in
  wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the rest of the acts of David, the former and
  the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history
  of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> concerning all his reign, and his power, and the
  times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
  earth.</p>
