  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I. Paul, (the) apostle of Jesus
  Christ according to the commandment of God our saviour, and Jesus Christ our
  hope; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to Timotheos, my beloved child
  in (the) faith. (The) grace, (the) mercy, [the] peace, from God the Father
  and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> According
  as I besought thee to abide in Ephesos, being (myself) about to go to (the)
  Makedonia, that thou mightest order some not to teach another doctrine,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> nor that they should attend to fables
  and genealogies, having no ends, these which give questionings rather than
  the dispensation of God which is in (the) faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But (the) end of this order is this: [a] love from
  a pure heart, and a good conscience, and [a] faith unfeigned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> These with which some agreed not, they turned
  aside to words of vanity; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and wishing
  to be teacher of the law, they understand not the things which they say, nor
  concerning the things upon which they establish themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But we know that the law is good, if one should do
  to it as law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Knowing thou this, that
  the law was not being for the righteous (man), but it was for the lawless and
  the unruly and the ungodly and the sinners, and them who are not sanctified,
  for the profane-hearted, for the father-slayers, for the mother-slayers, for
  the manslayers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for the fornicators,
  for the sleepers with male, for the deceivers of man, for the sellers of
  freemen, for the false speakers, for false swearers, and every other thing
  which is contrary to the sound doctrine; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> according to the Gospel of (the) glory of the
  blessed God, this with which I (pron.) was entrusted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I thank him who encouraged me, Christ Jesus our
  Lord, because he reckoned me faithful, he put me unto a ministry.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I was being a blasphemer at first,
  and persecutor and insulter, but I had mercy shown me, because I did it (lit.
  them) unknowingly in [an] unbelief; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  but the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with [a] faith and [a] love
  which is in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Faithful is
  (the) word, and it is worthy that we should receive it in all receiving, that
  Christ Jesus came to the world to save the sinners; among whom I am the
  first: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but I had mercy shown me, that
  in me first Jesus Christ might manifest all his long-suffering, for a pattern
  to them who believe him unto [an] eternal a life, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> (The) King of the ages, the incorruptible, the
  invisible only God, the honour is his and the glory unto age of the ages.
  Amen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> This order I lodge with thee,
  my child Timotheos, according to the prophecies which came before upon thee,
  that thou mightest arm thyself in them for the good soldiership; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> having [a] faith and a good conscience. That
  which some having left were wrecked in the faith: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> from whom is Hymeneos and Alesandros, these whom
  I gave to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_timothy2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I beseech then first of all things,
  to make prayers and supplications, intercessions, thanksgivings for all men,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for the kings, and for all who are
  exalted; that they may be in a life tranquil and meek, in all godliness and
  all gravity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> This is good, and it is
  acceptable before God our saviour; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he
  who wishoth that all men should be saved, and come unto (the) knowing the
  truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For God is one, and the
  mediator of God and the men is one, a man Christ Jesus, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> he who gave himself as redemption for all; the
  witness in his time; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> this to which I
  (pron.) was appointed as (ft) proclaimer and apostle. I say (the) truth, I
  say not falsehood, (the) teacher of Gentiles, in [a] faith and [a] truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I wish then that all men pray in every
  place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thus also the women, being in [a] placid beauty of
  heart, and [a] reverence and [a] prudence. Adorning themselves not in
  plaitings and gold (plur.) and pearls or in a clothing of great price;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but that which beseemeth the women to
  practise, professing [a] devoutness from good works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let a woman learn in [a] meekness in all
  subjection. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But I command not woman
  to teach, nor to be head over her husband, but let her be taught in [a]
  meekness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For Adam was formed first,
  then Eva; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and Adam was not deceived;
  but the woman--she having been deceived, became in a transgression:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but she shall be saved through her
  child-bearing, if they should stay in [the] faith and [the] love and [the]
  sanctification in [a] prudence.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_timothy3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Faithful is (the) word, he who
  wisheth for a bishopric, (it is) a good work which he desireth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> It is worthy then that the bishop should be
  irreproachable, having become husband of one wife, watchful, prudent,
  orderly, hospitable, a good teacher, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  not a winebibber [is], not a striker, but fair [is], not contentious [is],
  not a lover of silver [is], <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> taking
  good care of his house, having children who are in [a] subjection with all
  gravity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if there is one (who)
  knoweth not (how) to take care of his own house, how will he take care of the
  church of God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Not a novice [is], that
  he may not be proud, and fall down into [a] judgement of the devil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But it is worthy also that there
  should be good witness to him from those who are outside; that he may not
  fall into a reproach and a snare of the devil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Deacons also thus, being grave, being not
  double-spoken, and not addicted to much wine, being not greedy, being not
  lovers of dishonourable gain, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> having
  the mystery of (the) faith in a pure conscience. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> These also, let them be proved first, then let
  them minister, being blameless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Women
  also thus, being grave, being not slanderers, watchful, faithful in all
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let deacons be husbands of
  one wife, taking good care of their children and their house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For they who minister well,--a good degree (is)
  that which they make for themselves, and [a] great boldness in the faith,
  which is in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> These
  things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee quickly; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but if I should delay, that thou mayest know how
  it is worthy to live in (the) house of God, which is the church of the living
  God, which (is) a pillar and a firmness of (the) truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And confessedly, great is the mystery of the
  godliness, that which was manifested in (the) flesh, was justified in the
  spirit, was manifested unto the angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was
  believed in the world, was taken up away in [a] glory.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_timothy4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But the spirit is speaking plainly,
  that in the last days some shall depart from (the) faith, attending to
  seducing spirits, and demon words <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> of
  false-speaking hypocrites, their conscience being burnt in them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> forbidding the marriage, and (commanding) to
  abstain from [the] meats, these which God created for the faithful, to take
  of them in [a] thanksgiving, and (for) them who knew the truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Because every creature of God is good, and there
  is not anything which is rejected, being taken in [a] thanksgiving:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for it is sanctified through [a] word
  of God and [an] intercession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Laying
  these things before the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ,
  nourished in the words of (the) faith and the good teaching after which thou
  walkedst: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but depart from profane
  stories and old woman fables: exercise them in [the] godliness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> for the exercise of the body is profitable for [a]
  little, but [the] godliness is profitable in all things, having a promise of
  (the) present life, and (of) that which cometh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Faithful is (the) word, and it is worthy that we
  should receive it in all receiving <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  for therefore we toil and we are reproached, because we hoped in the living
  God, who is (the) saviour of all men, chiefly the faithful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Order these things and teach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let not any despise thy youth, but be a pattern
  to the faithful in (the) word, in the walk, in [the] love, in [the] faith, in
  [the] purity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Till I come, attend to
  [the] reading, [the] prayer, [the] instruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Neglect not the grace which is in thee, this
  which was given to thee through a prophecy, with the laying on hand of the
  presbytery. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> These be diligent in; be
  in these; that thy coming forward may be manifest to all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Take heed to thyself, and the instruction. Be
  continuing in them; for doing this thou shalt save thyself, and them who hear
  thee.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_timothy5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Strike not an old man, but exhort
  him as a father, the youths as brethren, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> the old women as mothers, but the young women as
  sisters, in all purity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Honour the
  widows who are really widows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But if
  there is a widow who hath children or children of children, let them learn
  first [a] piety in their own house, and that they should honour their
  forefathers: for this is good and acceptable before God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> She who is really a widow, being left alone hoped
  in God, continuing in the supplications and the prayers by night and day;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but she who is luxurious died (though)
  alive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Order these others that they be
  irreproachable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But if there is one
  who taketh not care chiefly for them of his own house, he denied (the) faith,
  and he is worse than an unbeliever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Let a widow be enrolled (lit. called) not below sixty years, having been wife
  of one husband, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> witnessed to in good
  works; namely whether she nourished children, or she received strangers, or
  she washed the feet of the saints, or she relieved the afflicted, or whether
  she walked after all good works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But
  the young widows refuse: for when they should be wanton against Christ, they
  wish to marry; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> having a judgement,
  because they denied the faith of (the) first (state). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But withal they learn also to be idle, going
  about from house to house; [but] not only idle, but also tattlers and
  busybodies, speaking the things which are not worthy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I wish then that the young women marry, and bear
  children, and be mistress of their house, not to give any pretext for the
  adversary concerning a calumny. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For
  already some turned aside after Satan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> If there is a believing woman who hath widows,
  let her care for them, and let them not add burden to the church, that it may
  be sufficient for those who are really widows. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The presbyters who preside well, let them be
  worthy of a double honour, chiefly those who toil in (the) word and the
  teaching. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the Scripture saith:
  Thou shalt not muzzle ox threshing. And the labourer is worthy of his hire.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou shalt not receive an accusation,
  against a presbyter except with two or three witnesses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Them who sin reprove before all, that to (the)
  rest also there may be fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I
  witness before God and Christ Jesus and his chosen angels, that thou keep
  these things, without justifying any one previous to (the) judgement, not
  doing anything according to partiality. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Lay not hand upon any quickly, nor be sharer in
  sins of another: keep thyself pure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And drink not water any longer; but drink a little wine for thee, because of
  thy stomach, and thy many weaknesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  There are men whose sins are manifest, about to draw before them unto the
  judgement; but there are others also whose (sins) will walk after them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus also the good works are
  manifest; and the others who are of another kind will not be able to be
  hid.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_timothy6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The servants who are under (the)
  yoke, let them esteem their masters in all honour, that (the) name of God and
  the teaching may not be blasphemed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  But they who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they
  are brethren; but rather let them serve, because they are believers and
  beloved, They who keep on in benevolence. With these things teach and exhort.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he who giveth other teaching, and
  who cometh not to sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching of
  [the] godliness, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> was proud, knowing
  not anything, but was diseased about questions and words of dispute, from
  which arise envyings and contentions and blasphemies and evil thoughts
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and wranglings. Men having their heart
  corrupt, and bereft of (the) truth, thinking of [the] godliness that it is a
  producer of gain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But [the] godliness
  in [a] sufficiency is a great producer of gain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For we brought not anything into the world, and it
  is not possible for us to bring anything out <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but having [a] food and [a] raiment, let these
  suffice us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But they who wish to be
  rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many lusts of foolishness,
  (which) profit not, those which plunge the man into (the) destructions and
  [the] perdition. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For (the) root of
  all evil is the love of silver, which some loved; they went astray from (the)
  faith, and they drew to themselves many griefs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But thou, O (the) man of God, flee from these
  things, but run after [the] righteousness, [the] godliness, [the] faith,
  [the] love, [the] patience, [the] suffering in [a] meekness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Strive the good strife of (the) faith, lay hold
  on the eternal life, to which thou wast called, and thou confessedst the good
  confession before many witnesses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I
  order thee before God, he who giveth life to all things, and Christ Jesus, he
  who witnessed before Pontios Pilatos the good confession, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> to keep this commandment, being thyself spotless,
  being blameless until (the) manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He whom will manifest in his times
  the blessed one, who is omnipotent, (the) King of the kings, and (the) Lord
  of the lords, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> the one alone, who hath
  [the] immortality, and who dwelleth in the light unapproachable; whom no man
  saw, nor is it possible that they should see him; he whose is the honour and
  the strength for ever. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The rich
  ones of this present age--order them not to be proud, nor to hope in this
  richness which is not permanent, but to hope in God, he who giveth all things
  to us in [a] richness that we may enjoy; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> to do good work, to be rich in good works, to be
  ready to give, as sharers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> laying
  (lit. throwing into) for themselves a good foundation unto that which cometh,
  that they may lay hold on the true life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> O Timotheos, keep the deposit, turning aside from
  profane and empty stories and that which opposeth us of the knowledge of the
  false name: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> this which some having
  promised agreed not with (the) faith. (The) grace with you.</p>
