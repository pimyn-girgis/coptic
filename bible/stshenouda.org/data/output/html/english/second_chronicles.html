  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Solomon began to build the
  house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord
  appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the
  threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thus Solomon began to build the
  house of God: the length in cubits—even the first measurement from end to
  end, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the portico in front of the house, its length
  in front of the breadth of the house was twenty cubits, and its height a
  hundred and twenty cubits: and he gilded it within with pure gold.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he lined the great house with
  cedar wood, and gilded it with pure gold, and carved upon it palm-trees and
  chains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he garnished the house
  with precious stones for beauty; and he gilded it with gold of the gold from
  Pharuim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he gilded the house, and
  its inner walls, and the door-posts, and the roofs, and the doors with gold;
  and he carved cherubs on the walls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And he built the holy of holies, its length was according to the front of the
  other house, the breadth of the house was twenty cubits, and the length
  twenty cubits: and he gilded it with pure gold for cherubs, to the amount of
  six hundred talents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the weight of
  the nails, even the weight of each was fifty shekels of gold: and he gilded
  the upper chamber with gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he
  made two cherubs in the most holy house, wood-work, and he gilded them with
  gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the wings of the cherubs
  were twenty cubits in length: and one wing of five cubits touched the wall of
  the house: and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other
  cherub. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the wings of these cherubs expanded were of
  the length of twenty cubits: and they stood upon their feet, and their faces
  were toward the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he made
  the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and wove cherubs
  in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Also he made in front of the
  house two pillars, in height thirty-five cubits, and their chapters of five
  cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he made chains, as in the
  oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and he made a hundred
  pomegranates, and put them on the chains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he set up the pillars in front of the temple,
  one on the right hand and the other on the left: and he called the name of
  the one on the right hand ‘Stability,’ and the name of the one on the left 
  ‘Strength.’</p>

  <h3 id="second_chronicles4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he made a brazen altar, the
  length of it twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the height ten
  cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he made the molten sea, in
  diameter ten cubits, entirely round, and the height of it five cubits, and
  the circumference thirty cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  beneath it the likeness of calves, they compass it round about: ten cubits
  compass the laver round about, they cast the calves two rows in their
  casting, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> wherein they made them twelve
  calves, —three looking northwards, and three westwards, and three southwards,
  and three eastwards: and the sea was upon them above, and their hinder parts
  were inward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And its thickness was a
  hand-breadth, and its brim as the brim of a cup, graven with flowers of
  lilies, holding three thousand measures: and he finished it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right
  hand, and five on the left, to wash in them the instruments of the
  whole-burnt-offerings, and to rinse the vessels in them; and the sea was for
  the priests to wash in. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he made
  the ten golden candlesticks according to their pattern, and he put them in
  the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he made ten tables, and put them in the
  temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left: and he made a hundred
  golden bowls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Also he made the priests’
   court, and the great court, and doors to the court, and their panels were
  overlaid with brass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he set the
  sea at the corner of the house on the right, as it were fronting the east.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Chiram made the fleshhooks, and
  the fire-pans, and the grate of the altar, and all its instruments: and
  Chiram finished doing all the work which he wrought for king Solomon in the
  house of God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> two pillars, and upon
  them an embossed work for the chapiters on the heads of the two pillars, and
  two nets to cover the heads of the chapiters which are on the heads of the
  pillars; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and four hundred golden
  bells for the two nets, and two rows of pomegranates in each net, to cover
  the two embossed rims of the chapiters which are upon the pillars.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he made the ten bases, and he
  made the lavers upon the bases; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and
  the one sea, and the twelve calves under it; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and the foot-baths, and the buckets, and the
  caldrons, and the flesh-hooks, and all their furniture (which Chiram made,
  and brought to king Solomon in the house of the Lord) of pure brass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> In the country round about Jordan the
  king cast them, in the clay ground in the house of Socchoth, and between that
  and Saredatha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> So Solomon made all
  these vessels in great abundance, for the quantity of brass failed not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Solomon made all the vessels of
  the house of the Lord, and the golden altar, and the tables, and upon them
  were to be the loaves of shewbread; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  also the candlesticks, and the lamps to give light according to the pattern,
  and in front of the oracle, of pure gold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And their snuffers, and their lamps were made,
  and he made the bowls, and the censers, and the fire-pans, of pure gold.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And there was the inner door of the
  house opening into the holy of holies, and he made the inner doors of the
  temple of gold.</p>

  <h3 id="second_chronicles5">5</h3>

  <p>So all the work which Solomon wrought for the house of the Lord was
  finished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Solomon brought in the
  holy things of his father David, the silver, and the gold, and the other
  vessels, and put them in the treasury of the house of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel,
  and all the heads of the tribes, even the leaders of the families of the
  children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
  Lord out of the city of David, —this is Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And all Israel were assembled unto the king in the
  feast, this is the seventh month. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  all the elders of Israel came; and all the Levites took up the ark,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and the tabernacle of witness, and all
  the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; and the priests and the Levites
  brought it up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And king Solomon, and
  all the elders of Israel, and the religious of them, and they of them that
  were gathered before the ark, were sacrificing calves and sheep, which could
  not be numbered or reckoned for multitude. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant
  of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy
  of holies, under the wings of the cherubs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the cherubs stretched out their wings over the
  place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark, and its staves above.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the staves projected, and the
  heads of the staves were seen from the holy place in front of the oracle,
  they were not seen without: and there they were to this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> There was nothing in the ark except the two
  tables which Moses placed there in Choreb, which God gave in covenant with
  the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it came to pass, when the priests when out of
  the holy place, (for all the priests that were found were sanctified, they
  were not then arranged according to their daily course,) <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that all the singing Levites assigned to the sons
  of Asaph, to Æman, to Idithun, and to his sons, and to his brethren, of them
  that were clothed in linen garments, with cymbals and lutes and harps, were
  standing before the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests,
  blowing trumpets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there was one
  voice in the trumpeting and in the psalm-singing, and in the loud utterance
  with one voice to give thanks and praise the Lord; and when they raised their
  voice together with trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and said,
  Give thanks to the Lord, for it is good, for his mercy endures for ever:—then
  the house was filled with the cloud of the glory of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the priests could not stand to minister
  because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.</p>

  <h3 id="second_chronicles6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then said Solomon, The Lord said
  that he would dwell in thick darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  But I have built a house to thy name, holy to thee, and prepared for thee to
  dwell in for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the king turned
  his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the
  congregation of Israel stood by. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: he has even fulfilled with his
  hands as he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> From the day when I brought up my people out of
  the land of Egypt, I chose no city of all the tribes of Israel, to build a
  house that my name should be there; neither did I choose a man to be a leader
  over my people Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But I chose
  Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my
  people Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it came into the
  heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the Lord said to my father
  David, Whereas it came into thy heart to build a house for my name, thou
  didst well that it came into thy heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; for
  thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for
  my name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord has confirmed
  this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David,
  and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the
  house for the name of the Lord God of Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and I have set there the ark in which is the
  covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the
  presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For Solomon had made a brazen
  scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length
  of it was five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of
  it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the
  whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and said, Lord God of Israel, there
  is no God like thee in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy
  with thy servants that walk before thee with their whole heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Even as thou hast kept them with thy servant
  David my father, as thou hast spoken to him in words:—thou hast both spoken
  with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hands, as it is this day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and now, Lord God of Israel, keep
  with thy servant David my father the things which thou spokest to him,
  saying, There shall not fail thee a man before me sitting on the throne of
  Israel, if only thy sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as
  thou didst walk before me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And now,
  Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word be confirmed, which thou hast
  spoken to thy servant David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For will
  God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of
  heavens will not suffice thee, what then is this house which I have built?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Yet thou shalt have respect to the
  prayer of thy servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to hearken to
  the petition and the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> so that thine eyes should be open
  over this house by day and by night, towards this place, whereon thou saidst
  thy name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which thy servant prays
  towards this house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And thou shalt
  hear the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whatsoever
  prayers they shall make towards this place: and thou shalt hearken in thy
  dwelling-place out of heaven, yea thou shalt hear, and be merciful.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> If a man sin against his neighbour,
  and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear
  before the altar in this house; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> then
  shalt thou hearken out of heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, to
  recompense the transgressor, and to return his ways upon his head: and to
  justify the righteous, to recompense him according to his righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And if thy people Israel should be
  put to the worse before the enemy, if they should sin against thee, and then
  turn and confess to thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in
  this house; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> then shalt thou hearken
  out of heaven and shalt be merciful to the sins of thy people Israel, and
  thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to them and to their
  fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> When heaven is restrained,
  and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against thee, and when
  they shall pray towards this place, and praise thy name, and shall turn from
  their sins, because thou shalt afflict them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> then shalt thou hearken from heaven, and thou
  shalt be merciful to the sins of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for
  thou shalt shew them the good way in which they shall walk; and thou shalt
  send rain upon thy land, which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> If there should be famine upon the
  land, if there should be death, a pestilent wind an blight; if there should
  be locust and caterpiller, and if the enemy should harass them before their
  cities: in whatever plague and whatever distress they may be; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Then whatever prayer and whatever supplication
  shall be made by any man and all thy people Israel, if a man should know his
  own plague and his own sickness, and should spread forth his hands toward
  this house; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> then shalt thou hear from
  heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt
  recompense to the man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart to
  be; for thou alone knowest the heart of the children of men: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> that they may reverence all thy ways all the days
  which they live upon the face of the land, which thou gavest to our fathers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And every stranger who is not himself
  of thy people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of
  thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm; when they shall come
  and worship toward this place; — <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> then
  shalt thou hearken out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling-place, and
  shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for; that
  all the nations of the earth may know thy name, and that they may fear thee,
  as thy people Israel do, and that they may know that thy name is called upon
  this house which I have built. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And if
  thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies by the way by which
  thou shalt send them, and shall pray to thee toward this city which thou hast
  chosen, and toward the house which I have built to thy name; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> then shalt thou hear out of heaven their prayer
  and their supplication, and maintain their cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Whereas if they shall sin against thee, (for
  there is no man who will not sin,) and thou shalt smite them, and deliver
  them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry
  them away into a land of enemies, to a land far off or near; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and if they shall repent in their land whither
  they were carried captive, and shall also turn and make supplication to thee
  in their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have
  wrought unrighteously; <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> and if they
  shall turn to thee with all their heart and all their soul in the land of
  them that carried them captives, whither they carried them captives, and
  shall pray toward their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city
  which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name:—
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> then shalt thou hear out of heaven,
  out of thy prepared dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplication, and
  thou shalt execute justice, and shalt be merciful to thy people that sin
  against thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And now, Lord, let, I
  pray thee, thine eyes be opened, and thine ears be attentive to the petition
  made in this place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And now, O Lord
  God, arise into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy
  priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and thy sons rejoice
  in prosperity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> O Lord God, turn not
  away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of thy servant
  David.</p>

  <h3 id="second_chronicles7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when Solomon had finished
  praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and devoured the
  whole-burnt-offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled
  the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the priests could not
  enter into the house of the Lord at that time, for the glory of the Lord
  filled the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And all the children
  of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord was upon the
  house: and they fell upon their face to the ground on the pavement, and
  worshipped, and praised the Lord; for it is good to do so, because his mercy
  endures for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the king and all
  the people were offering sacrifices before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of calves
  twenty and two thousand, of sheep a hundred and twenty thousand: so the king
  and all the people dedicated the house of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the priests were standing at their watches,
  and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to king
  David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy endures for ever, with
  the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the
  trumpets before them, and all Israel standing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court
  that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the
  whole-burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, for the brazen
  altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the
  whole-burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Solomon kept the feast at that time seven
  days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entering in of
  Æmath, and as far as the river of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And on the eighth day he kept a solemn assembly:
  for he kept a feast of seven days as the dedication of the altar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And on the twenty-third day of the
  seventh month he dismissed the people to their tents, rejoicing, and with a
  glad heart because of the good deeds which the Lord had done to David, and to
  Solomon, and to Israel his people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> So
  Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king’s house: and in whatever
  Solomon wished in his heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own
  house, he prospered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord
  appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and I
  have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> If I should restrain the heaven and there should
  be no rain, and if I should command the locust to devour the trees, and if I
  should send pestilence upon my people; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> then if my people, on whom my name is called,
  should repent, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, I
  also will hear from heaven, and I will be merciful to their sins, and I will
  heal their land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And now my eyes
  shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And now I have chosen and sanctified
  this house, that my name should be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart
  shall be there always. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if thou
  wilt walk before me as David thy father did, and wilt do according to all
  that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances and my judgments;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> then will I establish the throne of
  thy kingdom, as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
  fail thee a man ruling in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But
  if ye should turn away, and forsake my ordinances and my commandments, which
  I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> then will I remove you from the land
  which I gave them; and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will
  remove out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a by-word among all
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And as for this lofty house,
  every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall say, Wherefore has the
  Lord done thus to this land, and to this house? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And men shall say, Because they forsook the Lord
  God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they
  attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and
  therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.</p>
