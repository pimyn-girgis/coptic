  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_thessalonians1">1</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul and Silouanos and Timotheos to the church of
  ThessalonikÄ“ in God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> It is
  worthy that we should give thanks to God always for you, our brethren,
  according as is worthy, because your faith abounded in growing, and (the)
  love of each one of you abounded unto one another; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> so that we (pron.) boast ourselves in you in the
  churches of God for your patience and your faith in all your persecutions and
  your tribulations, these which ye receive: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> unto a manifesting of the righteous judgement of
  God, to make you worthy of the kingdom of God, this for which ye suffer.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> If it is a righteous judgement of God
  to recompense [an] affliction to them who afflict you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and ye, namely they who are afflicted, to give [a]
  rest to you with us, in the revelation of our Lord Jesus from (the) heaven
  with the angels of his power <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> in a
  flame of fire, about to take vengeance on them who knew not God, and who
  obeyed not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> these who will receive a judgement of eternal
  destruction from before (the) face of the Lord and from before (the) glory of
  his power, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> whenever he should come,
  being about to be glorified in the saints of his, To be wondered at in all
  who believed, because our witnessing to you was believed, in that day:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> which is that concerning which we
  pray always for you, that our God may make us worthy of the calling, and
  complete all good pleasure of [the] goodness, and a work of (the) faith in
  [a] power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> That (the) name of the
  Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye also in him, according to the
  grace of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_thessalonians2">2</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> We beseech you, our brethren, for (the) coming of
  our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling also unto him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that ye should not be moved quickly from the
  understanding; and that ye should not be troubled, neither through [a]
  spirit, nor through [a] word, nor through an epistle as through us, as that
  (the) day of the Lord approached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let
  not any deceive you according to any manner, that (it will be) unless should
  come first the apostasy and (the) man of [the] lawlessness, (the) son of
  (the) destruction should manifest himself, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> the adversary; and should exalt himself over
  everything which is called 'god,' or that which is worshipped; so that he
  should go and sit in the temple of God, manifesting himself that he is [a]
  god. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Ye know not that, still being
  with you, we were saying these things to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And now also that which layeth hold ye know it, to
  cause him to be revealed in his time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  For the mystery of (the) lawlessness already is worked: only until that which
  layeth hold now ceaseth in (the) midst; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and then shall be revealed the lawless (one), whom
  the Lord Jesus will destroy in the spirit of his mouth, and he will do away
  with him in (the) manifestation of his coming. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He whose coming is being according to a working of
  Satan in all power and sign and false wonder, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and all deceit of (the) wrongdoing for them who
  will perish; because that they received not the love of (the) truth to cause
  them to be saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Therefore God will
  send to them a working of error, to cause them to believe the falsehood:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that all may be judged who believed
  not in the truth, but were well pleased with [the] wrongdoing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But for us (lit. we), our brethren, it is worthy
  that we should give thanks to God for you always, namely those whom the Lord
  loved, because God chose you as a firstfruit of salvation in sanctification
  of the spirit and [a] faith of the truth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> which is that to which he called you through our
  Gospel unto a glorious lifegiving of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So then, our brethren, stand, and lay hold on the
  traditions which ye were taught, whether through [a] word or through an
  epistle of ours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But our Lord Jesus
  Christ himself, and God our Father, he who loved us, and he gave to us an
  eternal comfort, and a good hope in [a] grace, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> he shall comfort your hearts, and he shall
  confirm you in every work and every good word.
  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_thessalonians3">3</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Finally, our brethren, pray for us, that (the)
  word of the Lord may run and be glorified, according as also it happeneth
  among you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that we may be saved from
  the evil and wicked men; for (the) faith is not possessed by all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But the Lord is faithful, he who will
  confirm you, and he shall keep you from the evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But we are persuaded in the Lord about you, that
  ye do the things which we order you, and ye shall do them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But (the) Lord shall direct your hearts in the
  love of God and the patience of Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But we order you, our brethren, in (the) name of
  our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from every brother who walketh unruly, and
  not according to the things which we delivered unto them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For ye (pron.) know how ye ought to be like to us:
  because we were not unruly among you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  neither ate we [a] bread without cost of (any) one, but in [a] toil and [a]
  pain working in the day and the night, that we might not add burden to one of
  you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> not that we have not authority,
  but that we might give ourselves to you as (an) example, that ye might be
  like to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For even when we were
  with you, this we were ordering you, that he who wisheth not to work, neither
  let him even eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For we hear
  concerning some among you, walking unruly, and not working at all, but being
  busybodies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But such, we order them,
  and we beseech in the Lord Jesus, that in [a] meekness doing their work, they
  may eat their bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But ye, our
  brethren, be not weary of doing the good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> If there is one disobedient to our word through
  the epistles, mark this (one) not to have company with him, that he may be
  shamed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And let him not be with you
  as an enemy, but as a brother instruct him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But the Lord himself of the peace shall give to
  you the peace always in every form. The Lord with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> My salutation in mine own hand, Paul, which is a
  sign in all the epistles, thus I write. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> (The) grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you
  all.
