  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul, (the) apostle of Jesus Christ
  through the will of God, to all the saints who are in Ephesos, and faithful
  who (are) in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> (The) grace
  to you and (the) peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Blessed is God and the Father of our
  Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the (places)
  of the heavens in Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> According as
  he chose us in him before (the) foundation of the world, that we might be
  holy, being stainless before him in [a] love: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> he having foreordained us unto [a] son-ship
  through Jesus Christ into him, according to the good pleasure of his will,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> unto a praise of (the) glory of his
  grace, this which he granted to us in his beloved, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> he through whose blood we received the redemption,
  the forgiveness of our transgressions. According to the riches of his
  kindness, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> this which abounded into us,
  in all wisdom and all understanding, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  he having shewn to us the mystery of his will, according to his good
  pleasure, this which he pre-established in him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> unto a dispensation of (the) fulness of the
  times, To complete all things in Christ, those which are in the heavens, and
  those which are upon the earth; in him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> he (lit. this) in whom we were made an heritage,
  having ordained us from (the) first. According to the pre-establishment of
  him who worketh in every work according to the counsel of his will;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that we should be unto a praise of
  his glory, namely they who were beforehand in hoping in Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> he (lit. this) in whom ye also,--ye heard (the)
  word of the truth, the Gospel of our salvation,--he (lit. this) in whom
  having believed ye were sealed in the holy spirit of the promise,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> which is (the) earnest of the
  inheritance unto a redemption of the life-giving a, unto a praise of his
  glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Therefore I also having heard
  of the faith, which is among you, in our Lord Jesus, and (among) all the
  saints, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I cease not giving thanks for
  you, remembering you in my prayers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  that God of our Lord Jesus, the Father of (the) glory, might give to you a
  spirit of wisdom and a revelation in his knowledge; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> to cause the eyes of your heart to enlighten,
  that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the riches of
  (the) glory of his inheritance in the saints, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and what is the abundance of the greatness of his
  power into us, namely those who believe. According to the working of (the)
  strength of his power <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> which (sc. the
  power) he worked in Christ, having raised him from them who are dead; and he
  made him sit at his right hand, in the (places) of the heavens, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> above all rule, and all authority, and all power,
  and all (the) dominion, and all names which are named, not only in this age,
  but (a.) also in that which cometh: <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  and he caused all things to be subject below his feet, and he gave him as
  head of the church (more) than them all, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> which is his body, the fulness of him to whom all
  things belong, being filled with all things.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_ephesians2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And ye also being dead in your
  transgressions and your sins, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> in which
  ye were walking once according to (the) age of this world, according to (the)
  ruler of (the) authority of the air, of the spirit, this which worketh now in
  the sons of the disobedience; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> among
  whom we all were walking once in the lusts of (the) flesh, doing the wishes
  of the flesh and the thoughts of heart, and we were being by nature children
  of (the) anger, as (the) rest also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  But God is rich in (the) mercy, because of his great love, this in which he
  loved us: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and (to us) being dead in
  our transgressions he gave life in Christ: in [a] grace, them, ye were saved:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and he raised us with him, and made us
  sit with him in the (places) of the heavens, in Christ Jesus; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that he might manifest in the ages which come the
  abounding riches of his grace in [a] kindness about us in Christ Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For in [a] grace ye were saved through
  [a] faith; and this is not anything from yourselves; the gift is of God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> not from works, that no one may boast
  himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For we are (being) a making
  of his, he having created us in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before
  prepared, that we might walk in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Therefore remember that ye, namely the Gentiles once in (the) flesh, who are
  called the uncircumcision' by that which is called (the) circumcision' in
  (the) flesh made by hand; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that ye
  were being at that time outside of Christ, being strange to the commonwealth
  of Israel, and strange to the covenants of the promise, not having hope, and
  being without God in the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  now in Christ Jesus, ye, namely they who were far off once, drew near in
  (the) blood of Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For he is your
  peace, he who made the two one, and he pulled down the middle part of the
  barrier, having pulled down the enmity in his flesh, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> he did away with (the) law of the commandments in
  the decrees, that he might create (of) the two in himself one new man, making
  [a] peace; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and might reconcile the
  two in one body to God through the cross, having killed the enmity in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he came, he preached good tidings
  to you of [a] peace, namely those who were far off, and [a] peace to those
  who were near: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> because through him
  we, namely the two together, have the access in one spirit to the Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> So then ye (are) no more strangers
  and sojourners, but fellow citizens of the saints, and they of the household
  of God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> built upon the foundation of
  the apostles and the prophets, Christ Jesus being head corner stone unto it;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> he (lit. this) in whom the whole
  building constructed will grow unto a holy temple in the Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> he (lit. this) in whom ye also are sharing in
  being built unto a dwelling-place of God in the spirit.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_ephesians3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore I Paul, the prisoner of
  Christ Jesus for you, namely the Gentiles, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> if ye heard the dispensation of the grace of God
  which is given to me unto you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> that
  according to a revelation the mystery was shown to me, according as I wrote
  before to you in few (words), <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  according to that which it is possible for you, wishing' to know my
  understanding in the mystery of Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> this which was not manifested to generations of
  (the) sons of [the] men, As now it was revealed to his holy apostles and his
  prophets in the spirit; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> to cause the
  Gentiles to be fellow heirs and fellow (members of the) body, sharing the
  promise, which is in Christ Jesus through the Gospel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> this of (lit. to) which I became minister,
  according to the free gift of the grace of God which is given to me according
  to the working of his power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I am he
  who is less than all the saints: this grace was given to me to preach good
  tidings to the Gentiles of the riches of Christ, of which there is no end;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and to give (the) light to all men, as
  to what is the dispensation of the mystery, this which was hid since the ages
  in God, be (lit. this) who created all things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> That he might manifest now to the ruler and the
  authorities in the (places) of the heavens through the church, the wisdom, of
  God which is of various kinds, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  according to the ordinance from before the ages, this which he made in Christ
  Jesus our Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> he (lit. this) in
  whom we received the boldness and the access in [a] confidence through his
  faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore I ask, not to faint
  in the tribulations for you, which is your glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore I bend my knees to the Father,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> from whom are named all the families
  in the heavens and upon the earth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  that he may give to you according to (the) riches of his glory to be
  strengthened in [a] power through his spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> To cause Christ to dwell in the inner man through
  the faith in your hearts; that ye, being rooted in [a] love, being firmly
  founded, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> may be able to apprehend
  with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the height and the
  depth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> to know the love, which
  exceedeth (the) knowledge of Christ, that ye may be completed in all the
  completion of God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> for whom it is
  possible to do more than all things abundantly (more) than the things which
  we ask, or the things which we understand, according to the power which
  worketh in us, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> His is the glory in
  the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of (the) age of the
  ages. Amēn.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_ephesians4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I beseech you then, I the prisoner
  in the Lord, to walk according to (the) worthiness of the calling to which ye
  were called, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> in all humbleness of
  heart and [a] meekness and [a] longsuffering, Bearing with one another in [a]
  love; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> hastening to keep the oneness of
  the spirit and the bond which is complete, of [the] peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> One body and one spirit, according as ye were
  called in one hope of your calling: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  one Lord, one faith, one baptism. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> One
  is God the Father of all, who is upon all, and through all, and in all:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but to each one of us was given a
  grace according to (the) measure of the free gift of Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore he saith: He went to (the) height, he
  took captive a captivity, he gave gifts to [the] men.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But the going up, what is it except that he went
  also to the parts which are below of (the) earth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He who went down is he also who went up above all
  the heavens, that he might complete all things <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he (pron.) gave indeed apostles, but some as
  prophets, but others as preachers of good tidings, but others as shepherds
  and teachers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> for perfecting of the
  saints, unto a work of the ministry, unto a building of (the) body of Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Until we all attain unto the oneness
  of the faith and (the) knowledge of (the) Son of God, unto a full grown man,
  unto a measure of the stature of (the) fulness of Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that we may not be little children, thrown by
  (the) wave, being carried away in every wind of the doctrine, in the sleight
  of the men, in [a] craftiness towards the wiles of [the] error. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But doing (the) truth in [a] love, let us grow in
  (it) all things into him, who himself is the head, Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> he (lit. this) to whom the whole body is united
  and it is rationally consistent through all the joints of the supplies,
  according to the working in a measure of each one of the members; (and)
  maketh the growth of the body unto a building for him in [a] love.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But this I say, and I witness in the
  Lord, for you not to walk any more as the Gentiles walk in [a] vanity of
  their heart, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> darkened in their
  thought, being strange to the life of God because of the ignorance which is
  in them, because of the hardening of their heart; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> these who were without feeling gave themselves up
  to [a] defilement unto a work of all uncleanness in [a] wrongdoing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But ye (are) they who have not been
  thus taught Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> if ye heard him,
  and were taught in him, according as [a] truth which is in Jesus:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> that ye also may put away (lit. down)
  your former walk (of life), the old man, which will perish according to the
  lusts of the deceit; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but that ye may
  become new in the spirit of your heart, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and clothe you with the new man, which was
  created according to God in [a] righteousness and [a] holiness of (the)
  truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore put away (lit. down)
  [the] falsehood, speak (the) truth each one with his neighbour: because we
  (are) members of one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Be
  angry, and sin not: <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> cause not (the)
  sun to set upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He who stealeth let him not steal any more; but
  rather let him toil, working with his hands the good, that he may find to
  give to him who is in want. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> All evil
  words, cause them not to come from your mouth, but the good unto [an]
  edification of the need, that it may give [a] grace to them who hear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And grieve not the holy spirit of God
  in which ye were sealed unto the day of the redemption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> All bitterness, and all wrath, and all anger, and
  all crying out, and all blasphemy, take away from you, and all malice.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Be ye kind to one another,
  compassionate, forgiving one another according as God forgave you in
  Christ.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_ephesians5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Be ye then like to God, as beloved
  children; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And walk in love, as Christ
  also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice
  to God for a sweetsmelling savour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But
  [the] fornication, and all uncleanness, or [a] wrongdoing, cause not them to
  say their (lit. her) name among you, according as it is worthy of the saints;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> [the] empty words, and [the] words of
  folly or [the] jesting, these which it is not worthy to do: but rather [a]
  thanksgiving. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For this ye are knowing
  and ye are recognising, that no fornicator nor unclean man nor wrongdoer,
  which is [the] idolatry, hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Cause not any one to deceive you in
  empty words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the
  sons of [the] disobedience. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Be not ye
  then sharers with them; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> for ye were
  being darkness once, but now a light in the Lord. Walk as children of the
  light; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> for (the) fruit of the light
  was in all good and [a] righteousness and [a] truth – Chapter <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> proving what is pleasing to the Lord;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and be not sharers with the
  unfruitful works of (the) darkness, but rather even reprove (them);
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> for the things which they do secretly
  it is a shame even to mention them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  All things which the light reproveth are manifested: for everything which is
  manifested is [a] light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore he
  saith: Rise thou who sleepest, and stand (up) from them who are dead, and
  Christ shall enlighten thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> See
  then carefully my brethren, in what manner ye are walking, not as unwise, but
  as wise; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> buying the time, because the
  days are evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore be not ye
  foolish, but understand what is (the) wish of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And be not drunk with (lit. in) (the) wine, in
  which there is [a] dissoluteness, but ye completed in the spirit;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> speaking among yourselves, psalms and
  hymns and spiritual songs, praising and playing to the Lord in your hearts;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> giving thanks always for all, in
  (the) name of our Lord Jesus Christ and God (the) Father; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> being subject to one another in the fear of
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let the wives be subject to
  their husbands, as to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  Because the man is (the) head of the wife, as Christ is (the) head of the
  church, he is (the) saviour of the body. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also
  let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> [The] men love your wives, according as Christ
  loved the church, and he gave himself for her; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> that he might sanctify her, having sanctified her
  in (the) baptism of the water in (the) word, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> that he might present to himself the church being
  in [a] glory, not spot in her or stain or any such thing; but that she might
  be holy and stainless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Thus the men
  also ought to love their wives as their bodies. For he who loveth his wife
  loved himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For no one ever hated
  his flesh; but nourisheth it and cherisheth it, according as Christ also did
  the church; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> because we (are) members
  of his body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Therefore the man shall
  leave his father and his mother, and shall join himself to his wife; they
  (the) two shall become one flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  This mystery is great: but I (pron.) say (it) of Christ and the church.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Nevertheless ye also severally each
  of you, let him love his wife as himself; but the wife also, that she may
  reverence (lit. fear) her husband.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_ephesians6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> [The] children obey your parents in
  the Lord: for this is a righteous work. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Honour thy father and thy mother; that is to say,
  the first commandment which is in the promise, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> that the good may be to thee, and that thou mayest
  spend a great time upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  [The] fathers anger not your children: but nourish them in an instruction and
  an understanding of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> [The]
  servants obey your masters according to flesh in [a] fear and [a] trembling,
  in [a] singleness of your heart, as obeying the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> not in [an] eyeservice as pleasers of [the] men;
  but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from your souls;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> with a good thought, as being servants
  to the Lord, and not man: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Knowing that
  each one--that which he will do good, this he will receive from the Lord,
  whether servant or free. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And ye also,
  namely the masters, do to them thus, putting away [the] anger: knowing that
  their and your Master is in the heavens, and there is not regard of person
  with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Finally, my brethren, take
  courage in the Lord, and in (the) strength of his power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And clothe you with the whole armour of God, that
  ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Because our fight was not being to us against
  flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the
  world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual things of the evil in
  the (places) of the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Therefore take to you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
  in the evil day, having done all things, (to) stand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Stand, then, girding your loins in [a] truth, and
  clothe you with the breastplate of the righteousness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> put (lit. give) the shoe to your feet in (the)
  preparation of the Gospel of the peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And in all things take to you the shield of the
  faith, this in which ye will be able to quench all the fiery arrows of the
  evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And take to you the helmet of
  the salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> through all supplication and prayer,
  praying always in the spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and
  all prayer for all the saints, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and
