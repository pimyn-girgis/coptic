  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I. Paul, (the) servant of Jesus
  Christ, (the) apostle who is called, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  he who was ordained unto the preaching good tidings of God, which he promised
  before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> concerning his Son; who was made from (the) seed
  of David according to flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> (The) Son
  of God who is ordained in [a] power, according to (a) holy spirit, by (lit.
  from the) resurrection of the dead; Jesus Christ our Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> through whom we received [a] grace and an
  apostleship, unto an obedience of (the) faith among all the Gentiles, for his
  name: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> among whom are ye also, they who
  are called, of Jesus Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> to all
  who are in Rome, the beloved of God who are called, 'who are holy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> (The) grace to you and (the) peace
  from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. First indeed I thank my God
  through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in all the
  world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For God is my witness, whom I
  serve in my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, how I cease not remembering you,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> always in my prayers; praying that my
  journey may perhaps be disposed in the wish of God to come to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For I wish to see you, that I may
  give to you [a] spiritual grace, for confirming you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that is to say (lit. which is this), for mutual
  comfort (lit. confirMatthewion of heart) in you through the faith which we
  have in common, yours and also mine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  But I wish you not to be (lit. being) ignorant, my brethren, that I have many
  times disposed myself to come o you, and I was prevented up till now. That I
  may receive [a] fruit among you also, according as also the rest of the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have a debt to the Greeks
  and the Barbarians, the wise and the foolish, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> so ready am I to preach the good tidings to you
  also, namely those who are in Rome. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  For I am not ashamed of the Gospel: for it is the (lit. a) power of God unto
  [a] salvation to all who believe; the Jew first, and the Greek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the (lit. a) righteousness of God will be
  revealed in it from [a] faith unto [a] faith, according as it is written: The
  righteous will live from (the) faith.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the anger of God will be revealed from (the)
  heaven upon all godlessness and (the) wrongdoing of [the] men, who 'lay hold
  on the truth in [the] wrongdoing: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  because the knowledge of God is manifested in them. For God manifested it
  unto them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> His unseen things from
  (the) creation of the world, being understood in his creatures, are visible,
  that is to say, his eternal power and his divinity. So that they are without
  excuse (and) without answer: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> because,
  having known God, they glorified him not as God, nor thanked him, but became
  vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart became dark; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> saying that they are wise, they became fools,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and exchanged the glory of
  incorruptible God for a likeness of an image of corruptible man and birds and
  beasts and creeping things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore
  God delivered them in the lusts of their heart unto (the) uncleanness, so
  that their bodies were dishonoured among them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> who changed the truth of God into [the]
  falsehood. And worshipped and served the creature rather than him who
  created, that is to say, him who is blessed unto the ages. Amen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Therefore God delivered them unto vile passions:
  for their women turned their natural use into an unnatural. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Thus the men also left the natural use of the
  woman, burned in their lust (lit. wish) of one another, men with men working
  unto (the) shame, they shall receive (the) recompence which was due from
  their error in themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  according as they did not approve to retain God in their (lit. a) knowledge,
  God delivered them unto a reprobate heart, to do the things which are not
  lawful to be done. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Being filled with
  all unrighteousness and wickedness and depravity and wrongdoing; being filled
  with envy and murder and strife and subtlety and evil thought. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Being whisperers, slanderers, haters of God,
  insolent, proud, boastful, inventors of [the] evil a things, disobedient to
  their parents, <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> senseless,
  dissentient, uncompassionate, unmerciful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Who know the righteousness of God, that they who
  do such things are worthy of (the) death, not only, then, do them, but also
  consent with them who do them.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore thou wilt not be able to
  answer, O man, namely every one who judgeth: for in the judgement with which
  thou judgest (lit. givest unto) thy neighbour, thou condemnedst thyself; for
  thou also doest these things, namely he who judgeth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For we know that the judgement of God was
  according to [a] truth upon them who do such things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest them
  who do such things, and doest them also thyself, that thou indeed wilt be
  able to escape the judgement of God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Or despisest thou the riches of his kindness and his forbearance and his
  longsuffering? Thou knowest not that the kindness of God bringeth thee unto
  (lit. a) repentance; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> but according to
  thy hardness of heart and thine impenitent heart thou treasurest up (lit.
  throwest in) for thee anger in the day of (the) anger and the revelation of
  the just judgement of God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> who will
  give to each one according to his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They indeed who persisted in a good work, [a]
  glory and [an] honour and [an] incorruption, to them who seek for [an]
  eternal life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But they who are of [a]
  strife and consent not with (the) truth, but are trusting to [the]
  wrongdoing, [an] anger and [an] indignation, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> [a] tribulation and [a] pain upon every soul, of
  [the] men who do the evil, the Jew first, and the Greek; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but [a] glory and [an] honour and [a] peace to
  every one who worketh the good, the Jew first, and the Greek: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> there is not respect of persons with God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For they who sinned without law,
  without law also will be destroyed: and they who sinned in the law, will be
  judged through the law; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> for not the
  hearers of the law are the righteous with God, but they who do the law will
  be justified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if there are the
  Gentiles, who have not law, (yet) by nature do the things of the law, these
  who have not law are (a) law to themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> These who manifest the work of the law written in
  their heart, and (with) their conscience bearing witness unto them with them,
  and their thoughts accusing (lit. between them with) one another, or even
  will excuse <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> in the day of God, (who)
  will judge the hidden things of [the] man according to my Gospel through
  Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If thou namest thyself
  Jew,' thou restest thyself upon the law and boastest thyself in God,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and knowest his wish, and approvest
  the things which are the best, thou instructest thyself from the law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou trustest that thou (art) a guide
  of the blind, a light of them who are in (the) darkness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> (the) teacher of the foolish and (the) master of
  the little children, having (the) form of (the) knowledge and the truth which
  is in the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He then who teacheth
  another--teachest thou not thyself? He who preacheth not to steal--stealest
  thou? <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He who saith: 'Commit not
  adultery'-- committest thou adultery? He who abhorreth the idols--art thou
  (a) temple robber? <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He who boasteth
  himself in the law--through the transgression of the law dishonourest thou
  God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For (the) name of God is
  blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, according as it is written.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For there is profit in [the]
  circumcision if thou should do the law; but if thou art (a) transgressor of
  the law, thy circumcision became uncircumcision. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> If then [the] uncircumcision should keep the
  righteousness of the law, will not his uncircumcision be reckoned for [a]
  circumcision? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the natural
  uncircumcision fulfilling (the) work of the law will judge thee a who art (a
  Jew) through the written law and the circumcision, because (or, that) thou
  wast a transgressor of the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For
  the Jew is not (he) who is outwardly the Jew, nor is (the) circumcision which
  is manifest in (the) flesh the circumcision: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> but the inward (lit. who is hidden) Jew, this is
  the Jew, and the circumcision (is that) of the heart in [a] spirit, not in
  [a] writing, whose praise is not from man, but it is from God.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> What then is the advantage (lit.
  the more) of the Jew? or what is (the) profit of the circumcision?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Much it is according to every way:
  first indeed because they were intrusted with the words of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For what if some were unbelieving? Will their
  unbelief do away with the faith of God? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> It shall not be. But let God be speaking truth,
  and every man speaking falsehood; according as it is written, That thou
  mightest be justified in thy words and overcome when thou wilt be judged.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If our wrongdoing will set up the
  righteousness of God, what shall (lit. will) we say? Is God a wrongdoer being
  about to bring his anger? I said this humanly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> It shall not be: otherwise how will God judge the
  world? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But if the truth of God
  abounded unto his glory in my falsehood, then why am I also judged as a
  sinner, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and not according as we are
  blasphemed, as some say of us, that we say: Let us do evil things, that good
  things may come to us?' whose condemnation (lit. judgement) is decided (lit.
  under (the) judgement). <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What then?
  Have we more? Not at all: we before found blame with the Jews and the Greeks,
  that they are all under (the) sin; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  according as it is written: There is not a solitary righteous one;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> there is not he who understandeth;
  there is not he who seeketh after God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They all turned aside, they became unprofitable
  together; there is not he who doeth [a] kindness; there is not even (lit. up
  to) one: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> an open sepulchre is their
  throat; they practised deceit with (lit. from) their tongue; a serpent poison
  is under their lips: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> these whose
  mouths are full of cursing and bitterness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> their feet hasten to shed blood; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> (the) crushing and (the) misery are in their
  ways; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and they knew not (the) way of
  [the] peace; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> the fear of God is not
  before their eyes.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But we know that
  all things which the law saith, it said them to those who are in the law;
  that the mouth of every one may be stopped, and all the world may be under
  the judgement of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Because from
  the works of the law no flesh will be justified with God: through the law
  became (the) knowing (the) sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But
  now without the law the righteousness of God was manifested, being witnessed
  through the law and the prophets; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> but
  the righteousness of God which is through (the) faith of Jesus Christ in
  every one who believeth. For there is no distinction made; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> all sinned and a they fall short of (the) glory
  of God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> being justified freely in his
  grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> whom God before set as a forgiver, through (the)
  faith, in his blood, unto (the) manifesting of his righteousness, because of
  (the) forgiving of the former sins which were committed, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> in the longsuffering of God. To cause his
  righteousness to be revealed at this present time: that he might be just and
  justifying the (man who is) of (lit. from) faith in Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Where then was the boasting? It was
  excluded. By what law? That of [the] works? Nay; but through (the) law of
  (the) faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For we shall (lit. will)
  reckon a man that he will be justified in (the) faith without the works of
  the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Or is God of the Jews only,
  and not of the Gentiles indeed (pr.) also? Yea, he is of the Gentiles also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> If then God is one, he who will
  justify (the) circumcision from (the) faith and the uncircumcision through
  the faith; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> shall (lit. will) we then
  make useless the law through the faith? It shall not be. But we shall (lit.
  will) set up the law.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> What then shall (lit. will) we say
  concerning Abraam that he was found our forefather according to flesh?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For if Abraam was justified from
  works, then he hath boasting, but not toward God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For what (is it) which the Scripture saith? But
  Abraam believed God, and it was reckoned to him for [a] righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He who worketh--his reward is not
  reckoned to him as a favour, but because it is owed to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But he who worketh not, but is believing him who
  justifieth the ungodly--his faith is reckoned to him for [a] righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> According as also David said the
  blessedness of the man to whom God will reckon the righteousness without
  work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Blessed are they whose
  lawlessnesses were forgiven, and whose sins were covered over. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord will not
  reckon sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> This blessedness then was
  it put upon (the) circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision? For we say that
  (the) faith of Abraam was reckoned to him for [a] righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> How then was it reckoned? when he was in (the)
  circumcision, or when he was in the uncircumcision? Not when he was in (the)
  circumcision, but in the uncircumcision: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and he received a sign (namely) of (the)
  circumcision, a seal of the righteousness, of (the) faith which was in the
  uncircumcision; to cause him to be father of all a who believe, though they
  be in uncircumcision, for [a] righteousness to be reckoned to them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and father of (the) circumcision, not
  of them only who are of (lit. from) (the) circumcision, but also (of) those
  who walk in the footsteps of (the) faith which was in the uncircumcision of
  our father Abraam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For not through
  the law was the promise given to Abraam, or his seed to cause him to be heir
  of the world, but through the righteousness of (the) faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if through (the) law they were the heirs;
  then the faith became void, and the promise was made useless: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for (the) law worked (an) anger; but where there
  is not law, neither is there transgression. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Therefore (it is) through (a) faith; that (it may
  be) according to (a) grace, to cause the promise to be confirmed to all the
  seed, not only that which is of (lit. from) the law, but also that which is
  of (lit. from) (the) faith of Abraam, who is father of us all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> According as it is written: 'I made (lit. put)
  thee father of a multitude of nations' before God whom he believed, who
  giveth life to the dead, and calleth those who are not existing as (if) they
  were existing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Who was not being
  without hope in a thing; he believed with a hope, to become a multitude of
  nations, according as it was said to him: 'Thy seed shall be thus.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having not been weak in the
  faith, considering (pret.) his body, be found it as being already dead, (for)
  he was about a hundred years old; and the deadness also of (the) womb of
  Sarra. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having not doubted in (an)
  unbelief of the promise of God. But he was strong in the faith, giving
  (pret.) glory to God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and he was
  persuaded, that that which he promised it was possible for him to do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore it was reckoned to him for
  [a] righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But it was not
  written for him alone that it was reckoned to him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but also for us, namely, those to whom it was
  reckoned, who believe him who raised Jesus Christ our Lord from them who are
  dead, <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> who was given for our sins, and
  he rose for our justification.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Having been justified then through
  (the) faith, let us make [a] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> through whom became to us (the)
  entrance in faith into this grace in which we stand, and are boasting
  ourselves in a hope of (the) glory of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But not only (so), but we are also boasting
  ourselves in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation worked [a]
  patience: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but [the] patience, [an]
  approval; but [the] approval, [a] hope; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> but [the] hope is not ashamed, because the love of
  God was shed in our hearts through the holy spirit which he gave to us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For if yet when we were weak once,
  Christ died for the ungodly, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for
  scarcely would one (go) as far as to die for a righteous man, for perhaps one
  would dare to die for the good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  God commended his love to us, because we being yet sinners, Christ died for
  us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Much more, having been justified
  now on account of his blood, we shall be saved through him from (the) anger.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For if being enemies we were
  reconciled to God through (the) death of his Son, much more having been
  reconciled to him we shall be saved in his life; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> but not only (so), but (a.) we also boast
  ourselves in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we received the
  reconciliation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore, according
  as (the) sin came into the world through one man, and through (the) sin (the)
  death happened, and thus the death went into every man in whom they sinned.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For until (the) law (the) death was
  being in the world: but (the) sin was not being reckoned, there being no law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But (the) death reigned from Adam
  until Moses, even over them who did not sin in (the) likeness of the
  transgression of Adam, who is (the) type of him who cometh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But not according as the trespass so is the
  grace. For if in the trespass of one many died, much more the grace of God
  and the free gift in the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abounded unto
  many. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And not according as through
  one who sinned (so) is the gift: for the judgement indeed is through one unto
  a condemnation, but the grace through many trespasses unto a justification.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For if through (the) sin of the one
  (the) death reigned, much more they who will receive the abundance of the
  grace and the free gift of the righteousness shall reign in a life for ever
  through one man Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> So then
  according as (the) sin happened through the one, coming (lit. it came) upon
  all men unto a condemnation; thus also the justification through one is upon
  all men unto a justification of (the) life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For as through (the) disobedience of the one man
  the many became sinners, thus also through (the) obedience of the one the
  many will become righteous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But (the)
  law entered that (the) sin might be multiplied; but he whose sin abounded the
  grace was multiplied to him in abundance: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that according as (the) sin reigned in (the)
  death, thus also the grace might reign through the righteousness, unto a life
  for ever through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> What then shall (lit. will) we say?
  We shall (lit. will) remain in (the) sin, that the grace may abound.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> It shall not be. We who died to (the)
  sin, how again shall (lit. will) we live in it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Or know ye not that we, namely, those who were
  baptised in Christ, were baptised unto his death? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> We were buried then with him through the baptism
  unto his death. That as he rose from them who are dead through (the) glory of
  the Father, thus we also might walk in a newness of [a] life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For if we shared in being planted in (the) form of
  his death, [but] we shall be also unto his resurrection; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> knowing this, that our old man was crucified with
  him, that (the) body of (the) sin might be done away so as not to be servant
  to (the) sin any more; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for he who died
  was justified from (the) sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But if
  we died with Christ, we believe that we shall (lit. will) live with him also;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> knowing that Christ having risen from
  them who are dead will not die any more; (the) death then will not be lord
  over him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For that which he died he
  died unto (the) sin once: but that which he liveth he liveth to God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> thus also think of yourselves, that
  ye are dead indeed unto (the) sin, but ye are living to God in Christ Jesus
  our Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let not (the) sin then
  reign in your bodies, which will die, ye obeying its lusts: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> neither present your members instruments of [the]
  iniquity to (the) sin; but present yourselves to God, as those (lit. some)
  who are alive from the dead, and your members instruments of the
  righteousness of God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> for (the) sin
  will not be lord over you; for ye were not being under (the) law, but under
  the grace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> What then? (Is it) that we
  should sin, because we are not under (the) law, but under the grace? it shall
  not be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Or know ye not that to whom
  ye present yourselves servants unto (the) obeying him, ye (are) servants of
  him whom ye obey; whether (of the) sin unto a death, or (the) obedience unto
  [the] righteousness? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But thanks to
  God, that ye were being servants to (the) sin, but ye obeyed from your heart
  the form of teaching unto which ye were given: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> ye became free from (the) sin, but ye became
  servants to [the] righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A
  human thing I say, because of (the) weakness of your flesh: [for] as ye
  presented your members servants to (the) uncleanness and the lawlessness
  [down] unto the lawlessness, thus also now present your members servants to
  the righteousness [up] unto (the) sanctification. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For when ye were servants of (the) sin ye were
  being free from [the] righteousness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  what fruit then was there being to you at that (lit. the) time in the things
  of which ye are ashamed now? for (the) end of them is (the) death:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> but now ye became free from (the)
  sin, ye became servants of God, ye have your fruit unto (the) sanctification,
  but (the) end is a life for ever: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> for
  the wages of (the) sin is (the) death, but the grace of God is a life for
  ever in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Or know ye not, my brethren, for I
  spoke to them who know the law, that the law is lord over the man all time
  (that) he is living? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For the woman
  under husband is bound to her husband who liveth, in the law. But if the
  husband should die she is discharged (lit. done away with) from (the) law of
  the husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So then while the husband
  liveth they call her 'adulteress,' should she be with another husband; but if
  the husband should die, she is free from (the) law, not to be called
  adulteress,' should she be with another husband. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Wherefore then, my brethren, ye also died to (the)
  law through (the) body of Christ, to become (united) to another, that is to
  say, him who rose from them who are dead, that ye might bear fruit to God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For we being in the flesh, the
  passions of the sins, those through the law, were working in our members
  (the) bearing fruit to (the) death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  But now we were discharged (lit. done away with) from (the) law, having died
  in that in which we were held, so that we might be servants in a newness of
  the spirit, and not in an oldness of [a] writing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> What then shall (lit. will) we say (The) law is
  (the) sin. It shall not be. But (the) sin I had not known, except I knew it
  through the law. For [the] lust I was not knowing, except (the) law said:
  Thou shalt not lust'; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but (the) sin
  having taken an occasion through the commandment worked all lust in me: for
  without (the) law (the) sin was being dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But I was being alive once without the law. But
  the commandment having. come forth, (the) sin lived, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but I died; and the commandment was found (such
  that, being) intended for me unto (the) life, it (lit. this) became for me
  unto [a] death: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> for (the) sin took an
  occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and killed me through it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Wherefore (the) law indeed is holy,
  and the commandment is holy, and is just, and it is good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The good then became for me unto [a] death. It
  shall not be. But it is (the) sin: that by means of the good, (the) sin might
  be manifested (as) working for me [a] death: that (the) sin might be more
  sinful (lit. sinner) through the commandment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For we know indeed that the law is spiritual, but
  I am carnal, having been sold under (the) sin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For that which I work I know not: for not that
  which I wish is that (lit. this) which I do: but that which I hate I do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> If that which I wish not is that
  (lit. this) which I do, I assent to (lit. say with') the law, that it is
  good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But now (it is) not I who work
  it, but it is (the) sin which dwelleth in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For I know that the good dwelleth not in me, that
  is to say, in my flesh: for the wish is present with me, but to work the
  good, not: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> for not that which I wish,
  (the) good, is that (lit. this) which I do: but that which I wish not, (the)
  evil, is that which I do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But if that
  which I (pron.) wish not is that (lit. this) which I do, then it is no more I
  who work it; but (the) sin it is which dwelleth in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I find then the law that which wisheth to do the
  good with me, (but) that the evil is present with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For I agree with the law of God according to the
  man which is within: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but I see
  another law in my members, armed against (the) law of my heart, taking me
  captive with (the) law of (the) sin which dwelleth in my members.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> (The) wretched (the) man (that) I am!
  who will be able to save me from (the) body of this death ? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But thanks to God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
  So then I in my heart indeed am servant to the law of God, but in my flesh I
  am servant to the law of (the) sin.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> So then now there is no judgement
  to take them who are in Christ Jesus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  for the law of the spirit of (the) life in Christ Jesus made us free from the
  law of (the) sin and (the) death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  (as for) the impotence of the law, with (lit. in) which it was being weak
  through the flesh,--God sent his Son in a likeness of flesh of (the) sin, and
  because of (the) sin he condemned (the) sin in (the) flesh: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that the justification of the law might be
  completed in us, namely, them who walk not according to flesh, but according
  to spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For they who are according
  to flesh think the things of (the) flesh; but they who walk according to
  spirit think the things of the spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  For (the) thought of the flesh is (the) death; but (the) thought of the
  spirit is (the) life and [the] peace: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  because (the) thought of the flesh is enmity unto God; for it is not subject
  to the law of God, nor is it possible for it: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but for them who are in (the) flesh it is not
  possible to please God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But ye (pron )
  were not being in (the) flesh, but in the spirit, if there is the (lit. a)
  spirit of God dwelling in you. But he in whom the spirit of Christ dwelleth
  not, that one (lit. this who is there) is not of him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But if Christ (is) in you the body indeed is dead
  because of sin; but the spirit is [a] life because of [the] righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But if the spirit of him who raised
  Jesus from them who are dead dwelleth in you, then he who raised Christ Jesus
  from them who are dead shall make live your bodies also, which die, through
  his spirit which dwelleth in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So
  then, my brethren, we are not debtors to (lit. in) flesh to live according to
  flesh: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> for if ye live according to
  flesh, ye will die; but if in the spirit ye kill the works of the body, ye
  will live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For they who walk in the
  spirit of God, these are the sons of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For ye were not receiving a spirit of [a]
  servitude into [a] fear again; but ye received a spirit of [a] sonship, this
  in which ye cry: Abba [the] Father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And the spirit himself witnesseth with our spirit, that we (are) sons of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if we (are) sons, then we (are)
  heirs also; heirs indeed of God, fellow heirs with (lit. of) Christ; if we
  suffer with him, that we may be glorified with him also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For I think that the pains of this present time
  are not worthy of the glory which will be revealed to us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For the expectation of the creation gazeth out
  forward to the revelation of the sons of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the creation was subject to the vanity: it
  wisheth not, but (it is so) because of him who subjected it in a hope,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that the creation itself also will be
  free from the servitude of (the) corruption into the freedom of (the) glory
  of the sons of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For we know
  indeed that all the creation groaneth with us, and travaileth with us up to
  now. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But not only (so), but also we
  ourselves groan, having the firstfruit of the spirit, even we groan within
  us, looking out forward to the sonship, the redemption of our body.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For we were saved in [a] hope: but
  [a] hope which is seen is not [a] hope: for that which one seeth, he doth not
  wait for. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But if that which we see
  not we hope for, through [a] patience we look out for it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But thus also the spirit helped our infirmity:
  for what prayer we shall (lit. will) make according as is right, we know not.
  But the spirit himself intercedeth exceedingly for us with (lit. in)
  unspeakable groaning; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> but he who
  searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is (the) thought of the spirit, that he
  intercedeth unto God for the saints. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  But we know that with them who love God he worketh in all good things,--them
  whom he called according to his foreordaining. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Because they whom he foreknew, these also he
  foreordained (to be) conformed to (the) image of his Son, to cause him to be
  the firstborn of many brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But
  they whom he foreordained, these also (were) they whom he called: but they
  whom he called, these also he justified: but they whom he justified, these
  also he glorified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> What then shall
  (lit. will) we say against these things? If God is for us, who will be able
  to be against us? <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> He who spared not
  his own Son, but gave him for us all, how then shall not he grant all things
  to us with him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Who will be able to
  intercede against the elect of God? It is God who justifieth; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> who will be able to condemn? Christ Jesus is (he)
  who died, but more, he rose from them who are dead, he who is set on (the)
  right hand of God, who himself intercedeth for us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Who will be able to separate us from the love of
  Christ? [a, thus with all] tribulation is it, or hardship, or persecution, or
  hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> According as it is written: 'For thee we are
  killed all the day; we were reckoned as sheep for (the) slaughter.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But in all these things we conquer
  exceedingly through him who loved us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  For I am persuaded that neither (the) death, nor (the) life, nor angel, nor
  principality, 'nor the things which are, nor the things which will be, nor
  power, <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> nor height, nor depth, nor
  other creation--for none of them is it possible to separate us from the love
  of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> (The) truth is that which I say in
  Christ, I say not falsehood; my conscience witnesseth with me unto me in the
  (lit. a) holy spirit, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that there is a
  great grief with me, and a compassion unfailing (lit. it is not wont to fail)
  in my heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I (pron.) was praying
  to be accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to flesh:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> who are Israelite; they, whose is the
  sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the establishment of the law,
  and the ministry, and the promises; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  they, whose are the fathers, and they also--from them came Christ according
  to flesh, he who is set over all, God who (is) blessed for ever. Amen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But thus the word of God fell not
  away. For not all who are from Israel, [these] are Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> neither then are seed (plur.) of Abraam all sons:
  but in Isaac shall a seed for thee be called (i e. invited). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> That is to say, that the sons of (the)
  flesh--these are not the sons of God; but the sons of the promise will be
  reckoned for a seed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For this word is
  that of a promise: 'According to this time I shall come, and a son shall be
  to Sarra. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But not only (so), but also
  (the) Erebekka as well, having conceived from one bed, of Isaac our father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For when they were not yet born, nor
  yet had they done good or evil, that the choice which God ordained from (the)
  first might be permanent, being not from works, but from him who calleth,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> it was said to her: The elder (lit.
  great) shall be servant to the younger (lit. little).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> According as it is written: Jacob indeed I loved,
  but Esau I hated.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> What then shall
  (lit. will) we say? Is there [a] wrongdoing with God? It shall not be.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For he saith to Moses: I shall (lit.
  will) have mercy on whom I shall (lit. will) have mercy, and I shall (lit.
  will) have compassion on whom I shall (lit. will) have compassion.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> So then it is not of him who wisheth,
  nor is it of him who runneth, but it is of God who hath mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the Scripture saith to Pharaō: 'Therefore I
  raised thee (up), that I might manifest my power in thee, and that my name
  might be declared over all the earth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> So then on whom he wished he hath mercy, but whom
  he wished notes he hardeneth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou
  wilt say then to me: Why findeth he fault? For who is going (lit. giving)
  against his counsel?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Nay but, O man,
  who art thou who answerest against God? Shall the thing formed be able to say
  to him who formed it: Why madest thou me thus?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Or hath not the potter authority over his clay,
  from the same lump to make a vessel, one indeed unto (the) honour, but
  another unto [a] dishonour? <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But if
  God wished to manifest his anger, and to shew us his power, he endured (lit.
  brought) in a great longsuffering vessels of (the) anger, prepared unto (the)
  destruction: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that he might manifest
  the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, being those which he prepared
  before unto [a] glory, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> that is to say
  us, namely them whom he invited, not only from the Jews, but also from the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> As he saith also in Osee, I
  will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which
  was As also he saith to Ōsie: I shall (lit. will) call him who is not my
  people, "My people;" and her who was not beloved, "She. was beloved."'not
  beloved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And it shall be, in the
  place in which they said to them: Ye (are) not my people,' in that place they
  shall call them (the) sons of the living God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But Ēsaēas is crying out for Israel: If (the)
  number of (the) sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, (only) (the)
  remnant shall be saved: <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> for a word,
  completing it and cutting it off (is) that which the Lord will do upon (the)
  earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And according as again Ēsaēas
  said: If the Lord Sabaōth had not left a seed to us, we should have been as
  Sodoma, and we should have been like to Gomorra.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> What then shall (lit. will) we say that the
  Gentiles (did)? Having pursued not [the] righteousness, they caught [the]
  righteousness, but the righteousness which is (lit, the) from (the) faith.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But Israel pursuing the law of [the]
  righteousness reached not the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Why? Because it is not from (the) faith, but as from works. They stumbled at
  the stone of stumbling; according as it is written: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Behold I shall (lit. will) set in Siōn a stone of
  stumbling and a rock of offence, and he who believeth him shall not be
  ashamed.'</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My brethren, (the) good pleasure of
  my heart and my prayer which I make to God for them (is) unto [a] salvation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For I witness to them that a zeal for
  God (it is) which is in them, but not according to [a] knowledge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For being ignorant of the
  righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they were not
  subject to the righteousness of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For (the) end of the law is Christ unto [a] righteousness to every one who
  believeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For Moses wrote that the
  righteousness which is from (the) law, (the) man who will do it shall live in
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But the righteousness which is
  from (the) faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart: Who will be able to go up
  to (the) heaven?' That is to say, that he may bring Christ down: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> or, Who will be able to go down to (the) abyss?
  That is to say, that he may bring Christ up from them who are dead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But what saith the Scripture? The word
  is near thee; it is in thy mouth, and it is in thy heart, that is to say,
  (the) word of (the) faith which we proclaim, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that if thou shouldst confess with (lit. in, thus
  again) thy mouth, that Jesus is the Lord, and believe with thy heart that God
  raised him from them who are dead, thou shalt be saved: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for with the heart they believe him unto [a]
  righteousness, but with their mouth they confess him unto [a] salvation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the Scripture saith: Every one
  who believeth him shall not be ashamed.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For there is no separation of the Jew and the
  Greek: for this Lord is of all, being rich to all who cry up toward him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Every one who will pray (the) name of
  the Lord shall be saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> How then
  will they pray him whom they believed not? But how will they believe on him
  whom they heard not? But how will they hear without him who proclaimeth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But how will they proclaim unless
  they were sent? According as it is written: 'How beautiful are (the) feet of
  them who preach good tidings of the good (things).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But all obeyed not the Gospel. For Ēsaāas saith:
  'Lord, who believed our voice; and to whom was (the) arm of the Lord revealed
  ? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> So (the) faith is from (the)
  hearing, but (the) hearing is through (the) word of Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But I say: 'Heard they not?' Yea verily their
  sound went out over all (the) earth; and their words reached unto the end of
  the inhabited world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But I say: `Did
  not Israel know?' first, Moses saith: I shall rouse your jealousy (lit. give
  zeal to you) by (lit. upon) that which is not a nation, by a senseless nation
  I shall cause you to be angry.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But
  Esaeas is bold, and is saying: I was found by them who seek me not. I
  manifested myself unto them who ask me not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he saith concerning Israel 'I spread out my
  hands all the day toward a people disobedient, and they (masc. sing.)
  contradict (me).'</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I say then, Did God forsake his
  people? It shall not be. For I also am an Israelite, from (the) seed of
  Abraam, (the) tribe of Benjamin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> God
  forsook not his people whom he foreknew. Or know ye not what the Scripture
  saith in Ēlias? How he interceded with God for Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Lord, they killed thy prophets, they threw down
  thine altars: I alone was left; and they seek my life.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But what saith the oracle to him? I left to me
  seven thousand men, these who bent not knee to the (fern.) Baal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus also in this present time a remnant according
  to a choice of [a] grace existed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  if in [a] grace, then it is not from works: otherwise the grace will not be
  grace any more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> What then (is) that?
  That which Israel sought, this he obtained not; but the chosen (lit. choice)
  acquired (it). But (the) rest were hardened of heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> According as it is written: God gave to them a
  spirit of stupor, and eyes not to see, and ears not to hear until today.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And David saith: Let their table be to
  them a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a retribution to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let their eyes be darkened not to
  see; their back let it be bent (down) always.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I say then, Did they stumble that they might
  fall? It shall not be: but in their transgression (the) salvation happened to
  the Gentiles, that they may rouse their jealousy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If their transgression was the (lit. a) riches of
  the world, and their deficiency was riches of the Gentiles, then how great is
  their fulness? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But I say to you,
  namely the Gentiles. Moreover, so far as I am apostle of the Gentiles, I
  glorify my ministry: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that I may rouse
  the jealousy of my flesh, and save some of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For if their casting away made a reconciliation
  of the world, then what is their bringing in except (the) life from them who
  are dead? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But if the firstfruit (is)
  holy, then holy also is the lump: and if the root (is) holy, then holy also
  are the branches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if some from
  the branches were cut off, but thou, being from the bitter olive tree wert
  grafted in among them, and thou shared in (the) fatness of (the) root of the
  olive tree; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> boast not thyself over
  the branches. But if thou indeed (pron.) boastest thyself, thou (art) not
  (that) which beareth the root, but the root (is that) which lifteth up thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou wilt say then, that some from
  the branches were cut off, that I indeed (pron.) might be grafted in.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Well; they were cut off in their
  unbelief, but thou indeed (pron.) standest in (the) faith. Be not proud, but
  fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For if God spared not the
  branches according to nature, neither thee also shall he spare. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> See then the kindness and the severity of God:
  upon them indeed who fell [a] severity; but upon thee [a] kindness of God, if
  thou shouldst stay in the kindness: otherwise thou also wilt be cut off.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the others, if they should not
  stay in the unbelief will be grafted in again. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> If thou (pron.) wert cut away from the olive
  tree, bitter according to nature, and wert grafted in contrary to thy nature
  into the sweet olive tree, how much more may these be grafted in according to
  their nature into their own olive tree. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But I wish you not, my brethren, to be (lit.
  being) ignorant of this mystery, that ye may not become wise to yourselves
  only, that an hardening of heart happened to Israel in part, until (the)
  fulness of the Gentiles come in; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and
  thus all Israel shall be saved: according as it is written: He who will save
  shall come from Sion, he shall turn [the] ungodlinesses from Jacob.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And this is my covenant which will be
  to them, when I should take away their sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> According indeed to the Gospel they are enemies,
  because of you; but according to the choice they are beloved, because of
  their fathers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> for not repented of
  are the graces of God and the calling. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For as ye (pron.) were disobedient to God once,
  but now had mercy shown you in the disobedience of these, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> thus these also now became disobedient with a
  view to your mercy, that these also now might have mercy shown them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For God shut up all in (lit. into
  under) [a] disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> O (the) depth of the riches and the wisdom and
  the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgements, and untraceable
  are his ways! <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For who knew (the)
  heart of the Lord? Or who shared counsel with him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Or who first gave to him, and he gave to him in
  'exchange? <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> because from him, and
  through him, and into him are all things. His is the glory for ever.
  Amen.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But I beseech you, my brethren,
  through the compassions of God to present your bodies as a sacrifice living,
  holy, pleasing to God, and your reasonable worship, pleasing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And that ye should no more share fashion with this
  age. But should change your form in a newness of the understanding, to prove
  what is (the) wish of God, the good which is pleasing and which is complete.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I say through the grace which is
  given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think grandly beyond that
  which is right to think, but to think prudently, each one according as God
  divided to him a measure of faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For
  as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not one work:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> thus we also, namely many, being one
  body in Christ, are each of us members of one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But having graces diversified according to (the)
  measure of the grace which is given to us. Whether [a] prophecy, according to
  the likeness of (the) faith; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> or a
  ministry, in the ministry; or he who teacheth, in the (work of) teaching;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> or he who exhorteth, in [the]
  persuasion; he who giveth, in [a] singleness of purpose: he who is in the
  foremost place, in [a] diligence; he who hath mercy, in [a] joy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> [The] love in which there is not hypocrisy.
  Fleeing from the evil, uniting yourselves to the good, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> in [the] brotherly love being in [a] love toward
  one another, preferring one another above yourselves in [an] honour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Being not slothful in [the]
  diligence, being fervent in the spirit, serving the Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> rejoicing in [the] hope, being patient in the
  tribulations, continuing in the prayer, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> sharing towards the necessities of the saints,
  pursuing (the) hospitality. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Bless
  them who pursue you; bless, and curse not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Rejoice with them who rejoice; and weep with them
  who weep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Being of one mind (lit.
  thought) unto one another, and not thinking [the] proud things, but walking
  with them who are humble. Be not wise to yourselves alone, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and render not an evil to any one for an evil;
  taking care for good things before all men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> If it is possible for you, do your (best) to be
  at peace with all men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And avenge not
  yourselves, my beloved, but give place to (the) anger. For it is written:
  (The) vengeance is mine; I shall (lit. will) repay, saith the Lord.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But if thine enemy should hunger,
  feed him; if he should thirst, give him to drink: for doing this thou shalt
  gather coals of fire upon his head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Let not the evil overcome you, but with the good overcome the evil.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Let all souls be subject unto the
  exalted authorities for there is no authority except them which are by God;
  those which are by God they are ordained. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Wherefore he who opposeth the authority, opposed
  the ordinance of God: but they who oppose them shall be judged. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the rulers were being not for a fear to the
  good work, but to the evil. But thou wishest not to fear the authority, do
  the good, and an honour shall be to thee from it: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> for a minister of God it is to thee unto the good.
  But if thou shouldst do the evil, fear; for it was not bearing the sword
  without cause: for a minister of God it is taking vengeance for (the) anger
  on him who doeth the evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore
  it is necessary for you to be subject not only because of (the) anger, but
  also because of the conscience. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For
  therefore we pay tribute; for they are ministers of God continuing unto this
  work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Give to all their dues: give the
  tribute to him of the tribute, give the custom to him of the custom: give the
  fear to him of the fear: give the honour to him of the honour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Be not debtors for anything to any one, except to
  love one another. For he who loveth his neighbour, fulfilled the law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For this: Thou shalt not commit
  adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear
  false witness, thou shalt not covet,' and all other commandments were
  completed in this saying, in (the) Love thy neighbour as thyself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> [The] love did not evil to its
  neighbour, (the) fulfilment then of the law is [the] love. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And this, knowing the time, that already is it
  the hour to make you rise from the sleep; but now approached to us our
  salvation (more) than (at) the time in which we believed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The night advanced, but the day approached; let
  us then lay down the works of (the) darkness; but let us put on the arms of
  the light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> As being in the day let us
  walk, being seemly, not in revellings and drunkenness (plur.), not in beds
  and defilements, not in [a] strife and [a] jealousy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and take not
  care for the flesh in lusts.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> He who is weak in (the) faith
  receive not in disputations of reasonings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> There is he who believeth indeed that he may (lit.
  to) eat everything; but he who is weak eateth herbs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let not him who eateth despise him who eateth not:
  let not him who eateth not judge him who eateth, for God received him..
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Who art thou who judgest another man's
  (lit, of a stranger) servant? He is standing unto his lord, or is going to
  fall: but he is standing, for it is possible for the Lord to set him up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For there is he indeed who judgeth day
  before day, but there is he who judgeth every day (alike). Let each one be
  persuaded in his own heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He who
  thought of the day, thought unto the Lord; and he who ate, ate to the Lord;
  for he giveth thanks to God: and he who eateth not, eateth not to the Lord,
  and giveth thanks to God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For there is
  not any of us (who) will live to himself, and there is not any of us (who)
  will die to himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For if we shall
  (lit. will, thus again) live, we shall live to the Lord; but if we shall die,
  we shall die to the Lord: whether then we shall live or we shall die, we are
  those of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore Christ
  died and he lived, that he might be lord of them who are dead and them who
  live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But why judgest thou thy
  brother? Nay, thou also, why despisest thou thy brother? for we all shall
  (lit. will) be made to stand before the judgement seat of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For it is written: I live, [I] saith the Lord,
  (and I swear) that every knee shall be bent to me, and every tongue confess
  to God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So then each one of us will
  give account for himself to God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Judge not then any more one another; but judge this rather, not to set a
  stumbling-block or an offence for thy brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I know and I am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that
  there is nothing unclean through itself, except to him who thinketh of
  something that it is unclean, (then) to that one it is unclean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For if because of [a] food thy brother was to be
  offended, then thou walkest not any more according to [a] love. Destroy not
  him for whom Christ died, with thy food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Let not then your good be blasphemed:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> for the kingdom of God was not being
  in [an] eating and [a] drinking; but it was in [a] righteousness, and [a]
  peace, and [a] joy in the (lit. a) holy spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For he who serveth Christ in these things
  pleaseth God, and is upright among [the] men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> So then let us pursue the things of [the] peace,
  and the things of [the] edifying one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Pull not down the work of God because of [a]
  food. All things indeed are clean; but it is [an] evil to the man who will
  eat with offence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It is good not to
  eat flesh, nor to drink wine, and that in which thy brother will stumble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou (pronoun) hast [a] faith: let it
  (be) in thyself before God. Blessed is he who will not judge himself in that
  which he will approve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But he who
  doubteth, if he should eat, he condemned himself, because it is not an
  (action) from [a] faith. But everything which is not an (action) from [a]
  faith is [a] sin.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_romans15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But we (pronoun), namely they for
  whom it is possible, ought to bear the weaknesses of the powerless, and not
  to please ourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let each one of
  you please his neighbour in the good unto [an] <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For Christ also pleased not himself; but (a.)
  according as it is written: The reproaches of them who reviled thee came upon
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For all things which were written
  before were written for our instruction, that through [the] patience, and
  [the] comforting of the Scriptures [the] hope might be to us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But God of [the] peace and [the] comforting shall
  give one mind to you one with another according to Jesus Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> that in one heart and one mouth ye may glorify
  God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore receive one another according as Christ
  also received you unto [a] glory of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For I say that Christ became a minister of (the)
  circumcision for the truth of God; that he might confirm the promises of the
  fathers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but (for) the Gentiles
  because of [a] mercy to glorify God. According as it is written: 'Therefore I
  shall (lit. will) confess thee among the Gentiles, and I shall (lit. will)
  sing praise unto thy name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he
  saith again: Delight yourselves, [the] Gentiles, with his people.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he saith again: 'All the Gentiles
  bless the Lord; let all the peoples bless him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Ēsaēas saith again: (The) root of Jesse shall
  be, and he who will rise to rule the Gentiles, the Gentiles shall hope in
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But God of [the] hope shall
  fill you with all joy and [the] peace in (the) causing you to believe,
  abounding in [the] hope, in [the] power of the holy spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I also, my brethren, am persuaded about you, that
  ye also are full of every good thing, being full of all knowledge, it being
  possible for you to teach one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But boldly I wrote to you in part, as reminding
  you concerning the grace which was given to me from God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> to cause me to become minister of Jesus Christ
  unto the Gentiles, working in a priesthood unto the Gospel of God, that the
  offering up of the Gentiles might be received and sanctified in the (lit. a)
  holy spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I have a boasting in
  Christ Jesus towards God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For I shall
  not dare to say a word of (lit. in) the things in which Christ worked not
  through me unto an obedience of the Gentiles, in (the) word, in (the) work,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> in (the) power of signs and wonders,
  in [a] power of the (lit. a) holy spirit, so that from Jerusalem and its
  neighbourhood even unto [the] Allyrikon I filled them with the of Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But thus I was loving to preach good
  tidings where (the) name of Christ was not said, that I might not build upon
  another man's (lit. a stranger) foundation; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but according as it is written: They who were not
  shown concerning him shall see, and they who heard not shall understand.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore I was prevented many times
  from coming to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but now I have no
  place in these parts, but there is (indeed) a longing in me to come to you
  since many years: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> when I shall (lit.
  will) go to [the] Spania. For I hope to see you, being about to go thither;
  and that ye may escort me thither, if I should be satisfied with you
  somewhat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But now I shall (lit. will)
  go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For they of (the) Macedonia and Achaia were well
  pleased to make a common offering unto the poor of the saints who are in
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For they were well pleased
  (to do it), and the others (lit. they) are their debtors. For if the Gentiles
  share with them in a spiritual (thing), they ought to minister to them in the
  carnal (things) also: <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> should I then
  fulfil this, and seal this fruit to them, I shall go through you unto [the]
  Spania. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But I know that I came to
  you, I came in a fulness of blessing of Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I beseech you, then, my brethren, through our
  Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the spirit, to strive with me in
  your prayers for me to God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> that I
  may be saved from them who are disobedient in [the] Judea; and my ministry
  unto Jerusalem, that it may be acceptable unto the saints, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> that I should come to you in [a] joy through the
  will of God, and rest myself with you. <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Salute Asynkritos, Phlāgonta, Ermā, Patroba,
  Erma, and the brethren also who are with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Salute Phylologos and Joulia, Nerea and his
  sister, and Olympan, and all the saints who are with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Salute ye one another in a holy kiss. All the
  churches of Christ salute you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I
  beseech you, my brethren, to observe them who make the separations and the
  scandals contrary to (lit. away from) the teaching which ye learned, and turn
  away from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For such are not
  servants of our Lord Jesus Christ, but of their belly; and through their
  sweet speaking and their blessing they deceive (the) heart of the innocent.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For your obedience went (forth) unto
  all. I rejoice then over you: but I wish you to be wise in the good, but
  simple for the evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But God of [the]
  peace shall crush Satan under your feet quickly. (The) grace of our Lord
  Jesus Christ with you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Saluteth you
  Timotheos my fellow-worker, and Loukios and Jassōn and Sōsipatros my kinsman.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I salute you, I Tertios, who wrote
  this epistle in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Saluteth
  you Gaios my host and all the church. Saluteth you Arastos the treasurer of
  the city, and Kouartos the brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He for whom it is possible to confirm
  you according to my Gospel, and the proclaiming of Christ Jesus according to
  a revelation of a mystery, having been kept in silence for eternal times,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> but now it appeared through the
  Scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of God the eternal (lit.
  for ever), having been manifested unto [an] obedience of (the) faith among
  all the Gentiles, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> the one only the
  wise God, through Jesus Christ, he (lit. this) whose is the glory unto age of
  the ages. Amen.</p>
