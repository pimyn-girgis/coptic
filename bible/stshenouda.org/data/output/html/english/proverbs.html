  <h3 id="proverbs1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The Proverbs
  of Solomon son of David, who reigned in Israel; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to know wisdom and instruction, and to perceive
  words of understanding; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> to receive
  also hard saying, and to understand true justice, and how to direct judgment;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that he might give subtlety to the
  simple, and to the young man discernment and understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For by the hearing of these a wise man will be
  wiser, and man of understanding will gain direction; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and will understand a parable, and a dark speech;
  the saying of the wise also, and riddles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
  and there is good understanding to all that practise it: and piety toward God
  is the beginning of discernment; but the ungodly will set at nought wisdom
  and instruction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Hear, my son, the
  instruction of thy father, and reject not the rules of thy mother.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For thou shalt receive for thine head
  a crown of graces, and a chain of gold round thy neck. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> My son, let not ungodly men lead thee astray,
  neither consent thou to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If they
  should exhort thee, saying, Come with us, partake in blood, and let us
  unjustly hide the just man in the earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and let us swallow him alive, as Hades would, and
  remove the memorial of him from the earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> let us seize on his valuable property, and let us
  fill our houses with spoils: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but do
  thou cast in thy lot with us, and let us all provide a common purse, and let
  us have one pouch: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> go not in the way
  with them, but turn aside thy foot from their paths: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> for nets are not without cause spread for birds.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For they that are concerned in murder
  store up evils for themselves; and the overthrow of transgressors is evil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> These are the ways of all that
  perform lawless deeds; for by ungodliness they destroy their own life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Wisdom sings aloud in passages, and
  in the broad places speaks boldly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And she makes proclamation on the top of the walls, and sits by the gates of
  princes; and at the gates of the city boldly says, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> So long as the simple cleave to justice, they
  shall not be ashamed: but the foolish being lovers of haughtiness, having
  become ungodly have hated knowledge, and are become subject to reproofs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Behold, I will bring forth to you the
  utterance of my breath, and I will instruct you in my speech. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Since I called, and ye did not hearken; and I
  spoke at length, and ye gave no heed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  but ye set at nought my counsels, and disregarded my reproofs; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> therefore I also will laugh at your destruction;
  and I will rejoice against you when ruin comes upon you: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> yea when dismay suddenly comes upon you, and your
  overthrow shall arrive like a tempest; and when tribulation and distress
  shall come upon you, or when ruin shall come upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For it shall be that when ye call upon me, I will
  not hearken to you: wicked men shall seek me, but shall not find me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For they hated wisdom, and did not
  choose the word of the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> neither
  would they attend to my counsels, but derided my reproofs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Therefore shall they eat the fruits of their own
  way, and shall be filled with their own ungodliness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For because they wronged the simple, they shall
  be slain; and an inquisition shall ruin the ungodly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But he that hearkens to me shall dwell in
  confidence, and shall rest securely from all evil.
  <h3 id="proverbs2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son, if
  thou wilt receive the utterance of my commandment, and hide it with thee;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> thine ear shall hearken to wisdom;
  thou shalt also apply thine heart to understanding, and shalt apply it to the
  instruction of thy son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For it thou
  shalt call to wisdom, and utter thy voice for understanding; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and if thou shalt seek it as silver, and search
  diligently for it as for treasures; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For the Lord gives wisdom; and
  from his presence come knowledge and understanding, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and he treasures up salvation for them that walk
  uprightly: he will protect their way; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  that he may guard the righteous ways: and he will preserve the way of them
  that fear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then shalt thou
  understand righteousness, and judgment; and shalt direct all thy course
  aright. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For if wisdom shall come into
  thine understanding, and discernment shall seem pleasing to thy soul,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> good counsel shall guard thee, and
  holy understanding shall keep thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  to deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaks nothing
  faithfully. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Alas for those who
  forsake right paths, to walk in ways of darkness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> who rejoice in evils, and delight in wicked
  perverseness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> whose paths are
  crooked, and their courses winding; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  to remove thee far from the straight way, and to estrange thee from a
  righteous purpose. My son, let not evil counsel overtake thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> of her who has forsaken the instruction of her
  youth, and forgotten the covenant of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For she has fixed her house near death, and
  guided her wheels near Hades with the giants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> None that go by her shall return, neither shall
  they take hold of right paths, for they are not apprehended of the years of
  life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For had they gone in good
  paths, they would have found the paths of righteousness easy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For the upright shall dwell in the earth, and the
  holy shall be left behind in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The
  paths of the ungodly shall perish out of the earth, and transgressors shall
  be driven away from it.
  <h3 id="proverbs3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son,
  forget not my laws; but let thine heart keep my words: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for length of existence, and years of life, and
  peace, shall they add to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let not
  mercy and truth forsake thee; but bind them about thy neck: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> so shalt thou find favour: and do thou provide
  things honest in the sight of the Lord, and of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Trust in God with all thine heart; and be not
  exalted in thine own wisdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In all
  thy ways acquaint thyself with her, that she may rightly direct thy paths.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Be not wise in thine own conceit; but
  fear God, and depart from all evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Then shall there be health to thy body, and good keeping to thy bones.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Honour the Lord with thy just labours,
  and give him the first of thy fruits of righteousness: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> that thy storehouses may be completely filled
  with corn, and that thy presses may burst forth with wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord;
  nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> for whom the Lord loves, he rebukes, and scourges
  every son whom he receives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Blessed
  is the man who has found wisdom, and the mortal who knows prudence.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For it is better to traffic for her,
  than for treasures of gold and silver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And she is more valuable than precious stones: no
  evil thing shall resist her: she is well known to all that approach her, and
  no precious thing is equal to her in value. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For length of existence and years of life are in
  her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and glory: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16a)</span> out of her mouth proceeds righteousness, and she
  carries law and mercy upon her tongue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Her ways are good ways, and all her paths are
  peaceful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> She is a tree of life to
  all that lay hold upon her; and she is a secure help to all that stay
  themselves on her, as on the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  God by wisdom founded the earth, and by prudence he prepared the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> By understanding were the depths
  broken up, and the clouds dropped water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> My son, let them not pass from thee, but keep my
  counsel and understanding: <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> that thy
  soul may live, and that there may be grace round thy neck; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22a)</span> and it shall be health to thy flesh, and safety
  to thy bones: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that thou mayest go
  confidently in peace in all thy ways, and that thy foot may not stumble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For if thou rest, thou shalt be
  undismayed; and if thou sleep, thou shalt slumber sweetly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou shalt not be afraid of alarm coming upon
  thee, neither of approaching attacks of ungodly men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For the Lord shall be over all thy ways, and
  shall establish thy foot that thou be not moved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Forbear not to do good to the poor, whensoever
  thy hand may have power to help him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  Say not, Come back another time, to-morrow I will give; while thou art able
  to do him good: for thou knowest not what the next day will bring forth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Devise not evil against thy friend,
  living near thee and trusting in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Be not ready to quarrel with a man without a
  cause, lest he do thee some harm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Procure not the reproaches of bad men, neither do thou covet their ways.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For every transgressor is unclean
  before the Lord; neither does he sit among the righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The curse of God is in the houses of the ungodly;
  but the habitations of the just are blessed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> The Lord resists the proud; but he gives grace to
  the humble. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> The wise shall inherit
  glory; but the ungodly have exalted their own dishonour.
  <h3 id="proverbs4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear, ye
  children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For I give you a good gift; forsake ye
  not my law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I also was a son
  obedient to my father, and loved in the sight of my mother: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> who spoke and instructed me, saying, Let our
  speech be fixed in thine heart, keep our commandments, forget them not:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and do not neglect the speech of my
  mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And forsake it not, and it
  shall cleave to thee: love it, and it shall keep thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Secure it,
  and it shall exalt thee: honour it, that it may embrace thee; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that it may give unto thy head a crown of graces,
  and may cover thee with a crown of delight. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Hear, my son, and receive my words; and the years
  of thy life shall be increased, that the resources of thy life may be many.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For I teach thee the ways of wisdom;
  and I cause thee to go in right paths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For when thou goest, thy steps shall not be
  straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not be distressed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Take hold of my instruction; let it not go, —but
  keep it for thyself for thy life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Go
  not in the ways of the ungodly, neither covet the ways of transgressors.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> In whatever place they shall pitch
  their camp, go not thither; but turn from them, and pass away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For they cannot sleep, unless they have done
  evil: their sleep is taken away, and they rest not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For these live upon the bread of ungodliness, and
  are drunken with wine of transgression. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But the ways of the righteous shine like light;
  they go on and shine, until the day be fully come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But the ways of the ungodly are dark; they know
  not how they stumble. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> My son, attend
  to my speech; and apply thine ear to my words: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that thy fountains may not fail thee; keep them
  in thine heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For they are life to
  those that find them, and health to all their flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Keep thine heart with the utmost care; for out of
  these are the issues of life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Remove
  from thee a froward mouth, and put far away from thee unjust lips.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let thine eyes look right on, and let
  thine eyelids assent to just things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Make straight paths for thy feet, and order thy ways aright. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Turn not aside to the right hand nor to the left,
  but turn away thy foot from an evil way: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27a)</span> for God knows the ways on the right hand, but
  those on the left are crooked: <span style="color:#b00e23">(27b)</span> and
  he will make thy ways straight, and will guide thy steps in peace.
  <h3 id="proverbs5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son,
  attend to my wisdom, and apply thine ear to my words; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that thou mayest keep good understanding, and the
  discretion of my lips gives thee a charge. Give no heed to a worthless woman;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> for honey drops from the lips of a
  harlot, who for a season pleases thy palate: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but afterwards thou wilt find her more bitter than
  gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For the feet of folly lead those who deal with her
  down to the grave with death; and her steps are not established. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For she goes not upon the paths of life; but her
  ways are slippery, and not easily known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Now then, my son, hear me, and make not my words
  of none effect. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Remove thy way far
  from her; draw not near to the doors of her house: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> lest thou give away thy life to others, and thy
  substance to the merciless: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> lest
  strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours come into the houses
  of strangers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou repent at
  last, when the flesh of thy body is consumed, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and thou shalt say, How have I hated instruction,
  and my heart avoided reproofs! <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I
  heard not the voice of him that instructed me, and taught me, neither did I
  apply mine ear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I was almost in all
  evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Drink waters out of thine own vessels, and out of
  thine own springing wells. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Let not
  waters out of thy fountain be spilt by thee, but let thy waters go into thy
  streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let them be only thine own,
  and let no stranger partake with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Let thy fountain of water be truly thine own; and
  rejoice with the wife of thy youth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Let thy loving hart and thy graceful colt company with thee, and let her be
  considered thine own, and be with thee at all times; for ravished with her
  love thou shalt be greatly increased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Be not intimate with a strange woman, neither fold thyself in the arms of a
  woman not thine own. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For the ways of
  a man are before the eyes of God, and he looks on all his paths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Iniquities ensnare a man, and every one is bound
  in the chains of his own sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Such a
  man dies with the uninstructed; and he is cast forth from the abundance of
  his own substance, and has perished through folly.
  <h3 id="proverbs6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son, if
  thou become surety for thy friend, thou shalt deliver thine hand to an enemy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For a man’s own lips become a strong
  snare to him, and he is caught with the lips of his own mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My son, do what I command thee, and deliver
  thyself; for on thy friend’s account thou art come into the power of evil
  men: faint not, but stir up even thy friend for whom thou art become surety.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor
  slumber with thine eyelids; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that thou
  mayest deliver thyself as a doe out of the toils, and as a bird out of a
  snare. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Go to the ant, O sluggard; and
  see, and emulate his ways, and become wiser than he. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For whereas he has no husbandry, nor any one to
  compel him, and is under no master, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> he
  prepares food for himself in the summer, and lays by abundant store in
  harvest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8a)</span> Or go to the bee, and learn
  how diligent she is, and how earnestly she is engaged in her work;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8b)</span> whose labours kings and private men
  use for health, and she is desired and respected by all: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8c)</span> though weak in body, she is advanced by honouring
  wisdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> How long wilt thou lie, O
  sluggard? and when wilt thou awake out of sleep? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou sleepest a little, and thou restest a
  little, and thou slumberest a short time, and thou foldest thine arms over
  thy breast a little. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then poverty
  comes upon thee as an evil traveller, and want as a swift courier:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11a)</span> but if thou be diligent, thine
  harvest shall arrive as a fountain, and poverty shall flee away as a bad
  courier. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> A foolish man and a
  transgressor goes in ways that are not good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the same winks with the eye, and makes a sign
  with his foot, and teaches with the beckonings of his fingers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> His perverse heart devises evils: at all times
  such a one causes troubles to a city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; overthrow and irretrievable
  ruin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For he rejoices in all things
  which God hates, and he is ruined by reason of impurity of soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The eye of the haughty, a tongue unjust, hands
  shedding the blood of the just; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and a
  heart devising evil thoughts, and feet hastening to do evil, —are hateful to
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> An unjust witness kindles
  falsehoods, and brings on quarrels between brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> My son, keep the laws of thy father, and reject
  not the ordinances of thy mother: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but
  bind them upon thy soul continually, and hang them as a chain about thy neck.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Whensoever thou walkest, lead this
  along and let it be with thee; that it may talk with thee when thou wakest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the commandment of the law is a
  lamp and a light; a way of life; reproof also and correction: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> to keep thee continually from a married woman,
  and from the calumny of a strange tongue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let not the desire of beauty overcome thee,
  neither be thou caught by thine eyes, neither be captivated with her eyelids.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For the value of a harlot is as much
  as of one loaf; and a woman hunts for the precious souls of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Shall any one bind fire in his bosom, and not
  burn his garments? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> or will any one
  walk on coals of fire, and not burn his feet? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> So is he that goes in to a married woman; he
  shall not be held guiltless, neither any one that touches her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> It is not to be wondered at if one should be
  taken stealing, for he steals that when hungry he may satisfy his soul:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> but if he should be taken, he shall
  repay sevenfold, and shall deliver himself by giving all his goods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But the adulterer through want of
  sense procures destruction to his soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> He endures both pain and disgrace, and his
  reproach shall never be wiped off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  For the soul of her husband is full of jealousy: he will not spare in the day
  of vengeance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> He will not forego his
  enmity for any ransom: neither will he be reconciled for many gifts.
  <h3 id="proverbs7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son, keep
  my words, and hide with thee my commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> My son, honour the Lord, and thou shalt be strong;
  and fear none but him: keep my commandments, and thou shalt live; and keep my
  words as the pupils of thine eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  bind them on thy fingers, and write them on the table of thine heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Say that wisdom is thy sister, and
  gain prudence as an acquaintance for thyself; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that she may keep thee from the strange and wicked
  woman, if she should assail thee with flattering words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For she looks from a window out of her house into
  the streets, at one whom she may see of the senseless ones, a young man void
  of understanding, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> passing by the
  corner in the passages near her house, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  and speaking, in the dark of the evening, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> when there happens to be the stillness of night
  and of darkness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and the woman meets
  him having the appearance of a harlot, that causes the hearts of young men to
  flutter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And she is fickle, and
  debauched, and her feet abide not at home. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For at one time she wanders without, and at
  another time she lies in wait in the streets, at every corner. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then she caught him, and kissed him, and with an
  impudent face said to him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have a
  peace-offering; today I pay my vows: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  therefore I came forth to meet thee, desiring thy face; and I have found
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I have spread my bed with
  sheets, and I have covered it with double tapestry from Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my
  house with cinnamon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Come, and let us
  enjoy love until the morning; come, and let us embrace in love. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For my husband is not at home, but is gone on a
  long journey, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> having taken in his
  hand a bundle of money: after many days he will return to his house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So with much converse she prevailed
  on him to go astray, and with the snares of her lips forced him from the
  right path. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he followed her,
  being gently led on, and that as an ox is led to the slaughter, and as a dog
  to bonds, or as a hart shot in the liver with an arrow: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and he hastens as a bird into a snare, not
  knowing that he is running for his life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Now then, my son, hearken to me, and attend to
  the words of my mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let not thine
  heart turn aside to her ways: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> for she
  has wounded and cast down many, and those whom she has slain are innumerable.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Her house is the way of hell, leading
  down to the chambers of death.
  <h3 id="proverbs8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thou shalt
  proclaim wisdom, that understanding may be obedient to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For she is on lofty eminences, and stands in the
  midst of the ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For she sits by the
  gates of princes, and sings in the entrances, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> You, O men, I exhort; and utter my voice to the
  sons of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> O ye simple, understand
  subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Hearken to me; for I will speak solemn truths; and
  will produce right sayings from my lips. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For my throat shall meditate truth; and false lips
  are an abomination before me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> All the
  words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or
  perverse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They are all evident to
  those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Receive instruction, and not silver; and
  knowledge rather than tried gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For
  wisdom is better than precious stones; and no valuable substance is of equal
  worth with it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I wisdom have dwelt
  with counsel and knowledge, and I have called upon understanding.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The fear of the Lord hates
  unrighteousness, and insolence, and pride, and the ways of wicked men; and I
  hate the perverse ways of bad men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and strength is mine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> By me kings reign, and princes decree
  justice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> By me nobles become great,
  and monarchs by me rule over the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I love those that love me; and they that seek me
  shall find me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Wealth and glory
  belong to me; yea, abundant possessions and righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> It is better to have my fruit than to have gold
  and precious stones; and my produce is better than choice silver.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> I walk in ways of righteousness, and
  am conversant with the paths of judgment; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that I may divide substance to them that love me,
  and may fill their treasures with good things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21a)</span> If I declare to you the things that daily
  happen, I will remember also to recount the things of old. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The Lord made me the beginning of his ways for
  his works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He established me before
  time was in the beginning, before he made the earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> even before he made the depths; before the
  fountains of water came forth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> before
  the mountains were settled, and before all hills, he begets me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The Lord made countries and uninhabited tracks,
  and the highest inhabited parts of the world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> When he prepared the heaven, I was present with
  him; and when he prepared his throne upon the winds: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and when he strengthened the clouds above; and
  when he secured the fountains of the earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and when he strengthened the foundations of the
  earth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I was by him, suiting myself
  to him, I was that wherein he took delight; and daily I rejoiced in his
  presence continually. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For he rejoiced
  when he had completed the world, and rejoiced among the children of men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Now then, my son, hear me: blessed is
  the man who shall hearken to me, and the mortal who shall keep my ways;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts
  of my entrances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> For my outgoings are
  the outgoings of life, and in them is prepared favour from the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But they that sin against me act
  wickedly against their own souls: and they that hate me love death.

  Come, eat of my bread, and drink wine which I have mingled for you.

  himself upon falsehoods, attempts to rule the winds, and the same will pursue
  birds in their fight: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12b)</span> for he has
  forsaken the ways of his own vineyard, and he has caused the axles of his own
  husbandry to go astray; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12c)</span> and he goes
  through a dry desert, and a land appointed to drought, and he gathers
  barrenness with his hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> A foolish
  and bold woman, who knows not modesty, comes to want a morsel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> She sits at the doors of her house, on a seat

  The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but untimely grief

  The memory of the just is praised; but the name of the ungodly man is

  that walks simply, walks confidently; but he that perverts his ways shall be
  known. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He that winks with his eyes

  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The wealth of rich men is a strong city; but
  poverty is the ruin of the ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  The works of the righteous produce life; but the fruits of the ungodly
  produce sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Instruction keeps the

  the just is tried silver; but the heart of the ungodly shall fail.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The lips of the righteous know
  sublime truths: but the foolish die in want. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the
  righteous; it enriches him, and grief of heart shall not be added to it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> A fool does mischief in sport; but
  wisdom brings forth prudence for a man. <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Righteousness traces out blameless paths: but
  ungodliness encounters unjust dealing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  The righteousness of upright men delivers them: but transgressors are caught

  man does good to his own soul: but the merciless destroys his own body.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> An ungodly man performs unrighteous
  works: but the seed of the righteous is a reward of truth. <span style=

  he vanishes away; but the houses of the just remain. <span style=

  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Better is a man in dishonour serving himself, than
  one honouring himself and wanting bread. <span style=

  For the sin of his lips a sinner falls into snare; but a righteous man
  escapes from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13a)</span> He whose looks

  filled with good from the fruits of his mouth; and the recompence of his lips
  shall be given to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The ways of
  fools are right in their own eyes; but a wise man hearkens to counsels.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A fool declares his wrath the same

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> True lips establish testimony; but a

  There is deceit in the heart of him that imagines evil; but they that love

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Lying lips are a abomination to the
  Lord; but he that deals faithfully is accepted with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> An understanding man is a throne of wisdom; but
  the heart of fools shall meet with curses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The hand of chosen men shall easily obtain rule;
  but the deceitful shall be for a prey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> A terrible word troubles the heart of a righteous
  man; but a good message rejoices him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  A just arbitrator shall be his own friend; but mischief shall pursue sinners;
  and the way of ungodly men shall lead them astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> A deceitful man shall catch no game; but a
  blameless man is a precious possession. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In the ways of righteousness is life; but the
  ways of those that remember injuries lead to death.
  <h3 id="proverbs13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A wise son
  is obedient to his father: but a disobedient son will be destroyed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> A good man shall eat of the fruits of
  righteousness: but the lives of transgressors shall perish before their time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He that keeps his own mouth keeps his
  own life: but he that is hasty with his lips shall bring terror upon himself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Every slothful man desires, but the
  hands of the active are diligent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> A
  righteous man hates an unjust word: but an ungodly man is ashamed, and will
  have no confidence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> There are some who, having nothing, enrich
  themselves: and there are some who bring themselves down in the midst of much
  wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> A man’s own wealth is the
  ransom of his life: but the poor endures not threatening. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The righteous always have light: but the light of
  the ungodly is quenched. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13a)</span> Crafty
  souls go astray in sins: but just men pity, and are merciful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> A bad man does evil with insolence: but they that
  are judges of themselves are wise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Wealth gotten hastily with iniquity is diminished: but he that gathers for
  himself with godliness shall be increased. The righteous is merciful, and
  lends. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Better is he that begins to
  help heartily, than he that promises and leads another to hope: for a good
  desire is a tree of life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He that
  slights a matter shall be slighted of it: but he that fears the commandment
  has health of soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13a)</span> To a crafty son
  there shall be nothing good: but a wise servant shall have prosperous doings,
  and his way shall be directed aright. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  The law of the wise is fountain of life: but the man void of understanding
  shall die by a snare. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Sound
  discretion gives favour, and to know the law is the part of a sound
  understanding: but the ways of scorners tend to destruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Every prudent man acts with knowledge: but the
  fool displays his own mischief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A
  rash king shall fall into mischief: but a wise messenger shall deliver him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Instruction removes poverty and
  disgrace: but he that attends to reproofs shall be honoured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The desires of the godly gladden the soul, but
  the works of the ungodly are far from knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If thou walkest with wise men thou shalt be wise:
  but he that walks with fools shall be known. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Evil shall pursue sinners; but good shall
  overtake the righteous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> A good man
  shall inherit children’s children; and the wealth of ungodly men is laid up
  for the just. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The righteous shall
  spend many years in wealth: but the unrighteous shall perish suddenly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He that spares the rod hates his son:
  but he that loves, carefully chastens him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> A just man eats and satisfies his soul: but the
  souls of the ungodly are in want.
  <h3 id="proverbs14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Wise women

  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He that walks uprightly fears the Lord; but he
  that is perverse in his ways shall be dishonoured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Out of the mouth of fools comes a rod of pride;
  but the lips of the wise preserve them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Where no oxen are, the cribs are clean; but where
  there is abundant produce, the strength of the ox is apparent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> A faithful witness does not lie; but an unjust
  witness kindles falsehoods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thou shalt
  seek wisdom with bad men, and shalt not find it; but discretion is easily
  available with the prudent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> All things
  are adverse to a foolish man; but wise lips are the weapons of discretion.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The wisdom of the prudent will
  understand their ways; but the folly of fools leads astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The houses of transgressors will need
  purification; but the houses of the just are acceptable. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> If a man’s mind is intelligent, his soul is
  sorrowful; and when he rejoices, he has no fellowship with pride.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The houses of ungodly men shall be
  utterly destroyed; but the tabernacles of them that walk uprightly shall
  stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> There is a way which seems to
  be right with men, but the ends of it reach to the depths of hell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Grief mingles not with mirth; and joy
  in the end comes to grief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> A
  stout-hearted man shall be filled with his own ways; and a good man with his
  own thoughts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The simple believes
  every word: but the prudent man betakes himself to after-thought.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A wise man fears, and departs from
  evil; but the fool trusts in himself, and joins himself with the
  transgressor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A passionate man acts
  inconsiderately; but a sensible man bears up under many things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Fools shall have mischief for their portion; but
  the prudent shall take fast hold of understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Evil men shall fall before the good; and the
  ungodly shall attend at the gates of the righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Friends will hate poor friends; but the friends
  of the rich are many. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He that
  dishonours the needy sins: but he that has pity on the poor is most blessed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> They that go astray devise evils: but
  the good devise mercy and truth. The framers of evil do not understand mercy
  and truth: but compassion and faithfulness are with the framers of good.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> With every one who is careful there
  is abundance: but the pleasure-taking and indolent shall be in want.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A prudent man is the crown of the
  wise: but the occupation of fools is evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> A faithful witness shall deliver a soul from
  evil: but a deceitful man kindles falsehoods. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and
  he leaves his children a support. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> The
  commandment of the Lord is a fountain of life; and it causes men to turn
  aside from the snare of death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In a
  populous nation is the glory of a king: but in the failure of people is the
  ruin of a prince. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> A man slow to wrath
  abounds in wisdom: but a man of impatient spirit is very foolish.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> A meek-spirited man is a healer of
  the heart: but a sensitive heart is a corruption of the bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> He that oppresses the needy provokes his Maker:
  but he that honours him has pity upon the poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The ungodly shall be driven away in his
  wickedness: but he who is secure in his own holiness is just. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> There is wisdom in the good heart of a man: but
  in the heart of fools it is not discerned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Righteousness exalts a nation: but sins diminish
  tribes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> An understanding servant is
  acceptable to a king; and by his good behaviour he removes disgrace.
  <h3 id="proverbs15">15</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Anger slays
  even wise men; yet a submissive answer turns away wrath: but a grievous word
  stirs up anger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The tongue of the wise
  knows what is good: but the mouth of the foolish tells out evil things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The eyes of the Lord behold both the
  evil and the good in every place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The
  wholesome tongue is a tree of life, and he that keeps it shall be filled with
  understanding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> A fool scorns his
  father’s instruction; but he that keeps his commandments is more prudent. In
  abounding righteousness is great strength: but the ungodly shall utterly
  perish from the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In the houses
  of the righteous is much strength: but the fruits of the ungodly shall
  perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The lips of the wise are bound
  by discretion: but the hearts of the foolish are not safe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The sacrifices of the ungodly are an abomination
  to the Lord; but the prayers of them that walk honestly are acceptable with
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The ways of an ungodly man are an
  abomination to the Lord; but he loves those that follow after righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The instruction of the simple is
  known by them that pass by; but they that hate reproofs die disgracefully.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Hell and destruction are manifest to
  the Lord; how shall not also be the hearts of men? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> An uninstructed person will not love those that
  reprove him; neither will he associate with the wise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> When the heart rejoices the countenance is
  cheerful; but when it is in sorrow, the countenance is sad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> An upright heart seeks discretion; but the mouth
  of the uninstructed will experience evils. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The eyes of the wicked are always looking for
  evil things; but the good are always quiet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Better is a small portion with the fear of the
  Lord, than great treasures without the fear of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Better is an entertainment of herbs with
  friendliness and kindness, than a feast of calves, with enmity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> A passionate man stirs up strife; but he that is
  slow to anger appeases even a rising one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18a)</span> A man slow to anger will extinguish quarrels;
  but an ungodly man rather stirs them up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The ways of sluggards are strewn with thorns; but
  those of the diligent are made smooth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> A wise son gladdens his father; but a foolish son
  sneers at his mother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The ways of a
  foolish man are void of sense; but a wise man proceeds on his way aright.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> They that honour not councils put off
  deliberation; but counsel abides in the hearts of counsellors. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> A bad man will by no means attend to counsel;
  neither will he say anything seasonable, or good for the common weal.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The thoughts of the wise are ways of
  life, that he may turn aside and escape from hell. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The Lord pulls down the houses of scorners; but
  he establishes the border of the widow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> An unrighteous thought is abomination to the
  Lord; but the sayings of the pure are held in honour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> A receiver of bribes destroys himself; but he
  that hates the receiving of bribes is safe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27a)</span> By alms and by faithful dealings sins are purged
  away; but by the fear of the Lord every one departs from evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The hearts of the righteous meditate
  faithfulness; but the mouth of the ungodly answers evil things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28a)</span> The ways of righteous men are acceptable with
  the Lord; and through them even enemies become friends. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> God is far from the ungodly; but he hearkens to
  the prayers of the righteous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29a)</span> Better
  are small receipts with righteousness, than abundant fruits with
  unrighteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29b)</span> Let the heart of a
  man think justly, that his steps may be rightly ordered of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The eye that sees rightly rejoices the heart; and
  a good report fattens the bones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> He that rejects instruction hates
  himself; but he that mind reproofs loves his soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom;
  and the highest honour will correspond therewith.
  <h3 id="proverbs16">16</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15:33a)</span> All the works of the humble man

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Every one that is proud in heart is
  unclean before God, and he that unjustly strikes hands with hand shall not be
  held guiltless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5a)</span> The beginning of a good way is to do justly; and
  it is more acceptable with God than to offer sacrifices. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5b)</span> He that seeks the Lord shall find knowledge with
  righteousness: and they that rightly seek him shall find peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5c)</span> All of the works of the Lord are done with
  righteousness; and the ungodly man is kept for the evil day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> There is an oracle upon the lips of a king; and
  his mouth shall not err in judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  The poise of the balance is righteousness with the Lord; and his works are
  righteous measures. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> An evil-doer is
  an abomination to a king; for the throne of rule is established by
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Righteous lips are
  acceptable to a king; and he loves right words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The anger of a king is a messenger of death; but
  a wise man will pacify him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The son
  of a king is in the light of life; and they that are in favour with him are
  as a cloud of latter rain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The brood
  of wisdom is more to be chosen than gold, and the brood of prudence more to
  be chosen than silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The paths of
  life turn aside from evil; and the ways of righteousness are length of life.
  He that receives instruction shall be in prosperity; and he that regards
  reproofs shall be made wise. He that keeps his ways, preserves his own soul;
  and he that loves his life will spare his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Pride goes before destruction, and folly before a
  fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Better is a meek-spirited man
  with lowliness, than one who divides spoils with the proud. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He who is skillful in business finds good: but he
  that trusts in God is most blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Men call the wise and understanding evil: but they that are pleasing in
  speech shall hear more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Understanding
  is a fountain of life to its possessors; but the instruction of fools is
  evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The heart of the wise will
  discern the things which proceed from his own mouth; and on his lips he will
  wear knowledge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Good words are
  honeycombs, and the sweetness thereof is a healing of the soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> There are ways that seem to be right to a man,
  but the end of them looks to the depth of hell. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> A man who labours, labours for himself, and
  drives from him his own ruin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But the
  perverse bears destruction upon his own mouth: a foolish man digs up evil for
  himself, and treasures fire on his own lips. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> A perverse man spreads mischief, and will kindle
  a torch of deceit with mischiefs; and he separates friends. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> A transgressor tries to ensnare friends, and
  leads them in ways that are not good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  And the man that fixes his eyes devises perverse things, and marks out with
  his lips all evil: he is a furnace of wickedness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Old age is a crown of honour, but it is found in
  the ways of righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> A man slow
  to anger is better than a strong man; and he that governs his temper better
  than he that takes a city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> All evils

  <h3 id="proverbs17">17</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Better is a

  brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> As silver and gold are tried
  in a furnace, so are choice hearts with the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> A bad man hearkens to the tongue of transgressors:

  "color:#b00e23">(6a)</span> The faithful has the whole world full of wealth;
  but the faithless not even a farthing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  He that laughs at the poor provokes him that made him; and he that rejoices
  at the destruction of another shall not be held guiltless: but he that has
  compassion shall find mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Children’s children are the crown of old men; and their fathers are the glory
  of children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Faithful lips will not

  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Instruction is to them that use it a gracious
  reward; and whithersoever it may turn, it shall prosper. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He that conceals injuries seeks love; but he that
  hates to hide them separates friends and kindred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> A threat breaks down the heart of a wise man; but
  a fool, though scourged, understands not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Every bad man stirs up strifes: but the Lord will
  send out against him an unmerciful messenger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Care may befall a man of understanding; but fools
  will meditate evils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Whoso rewards
  evil for good, evil shall not be removed from his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Rightful rule gives power to words; but sedition

  pronounces the unjust just, and the just unjust, is unclean and abominable
  with God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Why has the fool wealth?
  for a senseless man will not be able to purchase wisdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16a)</span> He that exalts his own house seeks ruin; and he
  that turns aside from instruction shall fall into mischief. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Have thou a friend for every time, and let
  brethren be useful in distress; for on this account are they born.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> A foolish man applauds and rejoices
  over himself, as he also that becomes surety would make himself responsible
  for his own friends. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A lover of sin
  rejoices in strifes; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and the
  hard-hearted man comes not in for good. A man of a changeful tongue will fall
  into mischiefs; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and the heart of a
  fool is grief to its possessor. A father rejoices not over an uninstructed
  son; but a wise son gladdens his mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> A glad heart promotes health; but the bones of a
  sorrowful man dry up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The ways of a
  man who unjustly receives gifts in his bosom do not prosper; and an ungodly
  man perverts the ways of righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The countenance of a wise man is sensible; but
  the eyes of a fool go to the ends of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> A foolish son is a cause of anger to his father,
  and grief to her that bore him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> It is
  not right to punish a righteous man, nor is it holy to plot against righteous
  princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He that forbears to utter a
  hard word is discreet, and a patient man is wise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Wisdom shall be imputed to a fool who asks after
  wisdom: and he who holds his peace shall seem to be sensible.
  <h3 id="proverbs18">18</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A man who

  feels no need of wisdom, for he is rather led by folly. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Fear casts down the slothful; and the

  A man who helps not himself by his labour is brother of him that ruins

  Before ruin a man’s heart is exalted, and before honour it is humble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Whoso answers a word before he hears
  a cause, it is folly and reproach to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> A wise servant calms a man’s anger; but who can
  endure a faint-hearted man? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The heart
  of the sensible man purchases discretion; and the ears of the wise seek
  understanding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A man’s gift enlarges
  him, and seats him among princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A
  righteous man accuses himself at the beginning of his speech, but when he has
  entered upon the attack, the adversary is reproved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> A silent man quells strifes, and determines
  between great powers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A brother
  helped by a brother is as a strong and high city; and is as strong as a
  well-founded palace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> A man fills his
  belly with the fruits of his mouth; and he shall be satisfied with the fruits
  of his lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Life and death are in
  the power of the tongue; and they that rule it shall eat the fruits thereof.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He that has found a good wife has
  found favours, and has received gladness from God. (22a) He that puts away a
  good wife, puts away a good thing, and he that keeps an adulteress is foolish
  and ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19:3)</span> The folly of a man
  spoils his ways: and he blames God in his heart.
  <h3 id="proverbs19">19</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Wealth
  acquires many friends; but the poor is deserted even of the friend he has.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> A false witness shall not be
  unpunished, and he that accuses unjustly shall not escape. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Many court the favour of kings; but every bad man
  becomes a reproach to another man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Every one who hates his poor brother shall also be far from friendship. Good
  understanding will draw near to them that know it, and a sensible man will
  find it. He that does much harm perfects mischief; and he that used provoking
  words shall not escape. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He that
  procures wisdom loves himself; and he that keeps wisdom shall find good.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> A false witness shall not be
  unpunished; and whosoever shall kindle mischief shall perish by it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Delight does not suit a fool, nor is
  it seemly if a servant should begin to rule with haughtiness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> A merciful man is long-suffering; and his triumph
  overtakes transgressors. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The
  threatening of a king is like the roaring of a lion; but as dew on the grass,
  so is his favour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> A foolish son is a
  disgrace to his father: vows paid out of the hire of a harlot are not pure.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Fathers divide house and substance to
  their children: but a wife is suited to a man by the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Cowardice possesses the effeminate man; and the
  soul of the sluggard shall hunger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He
  that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despises his ways
  shall perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He that has pity on the
  poor lends to the Lord; and he will recompense to him according to his gift.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Chasten thy son, for so he shall be
  hopeful; and be not exalted in thy soul to haughtiness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A malicious man shall be severely punished, and
  if he commit injury, he shall also lose his life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Hear, son, the instruction of thy father, that
  thou mayest be wise at thy latter end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> There are many thoughts in a man’s heart; but the
  counsel of the Lord abides for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Mercy is a fruit to a man: and a poor man is better than a rich liar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The fear of the Lord is life to a
  man: and he shall lodge without fear in places where knowledge is not seen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He that unjustly hides his hands in
  his bosom, will not even bring them up to his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> When a pestilent character is scourged, a simple
  man is made wiser: and if thou reprove a wise man, he will understand
  discretion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He that dishonours his
  father, and drives away his mother, shall be disgraced and shall be exposed
  to reproach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> A son who ceases to
  attend to the instruction of a father will cherish evil designs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He that becomes surety for a foolish child will
  despise the ordinance: and the mouth of ungodly men shall drink down
  judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Scourges are preparing for
  the intemperate, and punishments likewise for fools.
  <h3 id="proverbs20">20</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Wine is an
  intemperate thing, and strong drink full of violence: but every fool is
  entangled with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The threat of a
  king differs not from the rage of a lion; and he that provokes him sins
  against his own soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> It is a glory to
  a man to turn aside from railing; but every fool is entangled with such
  matters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> A sluggard when reproached is
  not ashamed: so also he who borrows corn in harvest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Counsel in a man’s heart is deep water; but a
  prudent man will draw it out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> A man is
  valuable, and a merciful man precious: but it is hard to find a faithful man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He that walks blameless in justice,
  shall leave his children blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Whenever a righteous king sits on the throne, no evil thing can stand before
  his presence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who will boast that he
  has a pure heart? or who will boldly say that he is pure from sins?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The lamp of him that reviles father
  or mother shall be put out, and his eyeballs shall see darkness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> A portion hastily gotten at first shall not be
  blessed in the end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Say not, I will
  avenge myself on my enemy; but wait on the Lord, that he may help thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> A large and small weight, and divers
  measures, are even both of them unclean before the Lord; and so is he that
  makes them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> A youth when in company
  with a godly man, will be restrained in his devices, and then his way will be
  straight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The ear hears, and the eye
  sees: even both of them are the Lord’s work. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Love not to speak ill, lest thou be cut off: open
  thine eyes, and be filled with bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  A double weight is an abomination to the Lord; and a deceitful balance is not
  good in his sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A man’s goings are
  directed of the Lord: how then can a mortal understand his ways? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate some
  of his own property: for in that case repentance comes after vowing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> A wise king utterly crushes the
  ungodly, and will bring a wheel upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> The spirit of man is a light of the Lord, who
  searches the inmost parts of the belly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Mercy and truth are a guard to a king, and will
  surround his throne with righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Wisdom is an ornament to young men; and grey
  hairs are the glory of old men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  Bruises and contusions befall bad men; and plagues shall come in the inward
  parts of their belly.
  <h3 id="proverbs21">21</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> As a rush
  of water, so is the king’s heart in God’s hand: he turns it whithersoever he
  may desire to point out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Every man
  seems to himself righteous; but the Lord directs the hearts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> To do justly and to speak truth, are more pleasing
  to God than the blood of sacrifices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> A
  high-minded man is stout-hearted in his pride; and the lamp of the wicked is
  sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He that gathers treasures with a lying tongue
  pursues vanity on to the snares of death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Destruction shall lodge with the ungodly; for they
  refuse to do justly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> To the froward
  God sends froward ways; for his works are pure and right. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> It is better to dwell in a corner on the
  house-top, than in plastered rooms with unrighteousness, and in an open
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The soul of the ungodly shall
  not be pitied by any man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> When an
  intemperate man is punished the simple becomes wiser: and a wise man
  understanding will receive knowledge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  A righteous man understands the hearts of the ungodly: and despises the
  ungodly for their wickedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He that
  stops his ears from hearing the poor, himself also shall cry, and there shall
  be none to hear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> A secret gift
  calms anger: but he that forbears to give stirs up strong wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> It is the joy of the righteous to do judgment:
  but a holy man is abominable with evil-doers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A man that wanders out of the way of
  righteousness, shall rest in the congregation of giants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A poor man loves mirth, loving wine and oil in
  abundance; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and a transgressor is the
  abomination of a righteous man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> It is
  better to dwell in a wilderness than with a quarrelsome and talkative and
  passionate woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> A desirable
  treasure will rest on the mouth of the wise; but foolish men will swallow it
  up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The way of righteousness and
  mercy will find life and glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> A
  wise man assaults strong cities, and demolishes the fortress in which the
  ungodly trusted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He that keeps his
  mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from trouble. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A bold and self-willed and insolent man is called
  a pest: and he that remembers injuries is a transgressor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Desires kill the sluggard; for his hands do not
  choose to do anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> An ungodly man
  entertains evil desires all the day: but the righteous is unsparingly
  merciful and compassionate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> The
  sacrifices of the ungodly are abomination to the Lord, for they offer them
  wickedly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> A false witness shall
  perish; but an obedient man will speak cautiously. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> An ungodly man impudently withstands with his
  face; but the upright man himself understands his ways. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> There is no wisdom, there is no courage, there is
  no counsel against the ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> A
  horse is prepared for the day of battle; but help is of the Lord.
  <h3 id="proverbs22">22</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A fair name
  is better than much wealth, and good favour is above silver and gold.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The rich and the poor meet together;
  but the Lord made them both. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> An
  intelligent man seeing a bad man severely punished is himself instructed, but
  fools pass by and are punished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The
  fear of the Lord is the offspring of wisdom, and wealth, and glory, and life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thistles and snares are in perverse
  ways; but he that keeps his soul will refrain from them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The rich
  will rule over the poor, and servants will lend to their own masters.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He that sows wickedness shall reap
  troubles; and shall fully receive the punishment of his deeds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8a)</span> God loves a cheerful and liberal man; but a man
  shall fully prove the folly of his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He that has pity on the poor shall himself be
  maintained; for he has given of his own bread to the poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9a)</span> He that gives liberally secures victory an
  honour; but he takes away the life of them that posses them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Cast out a pestilent person from the council, and
  strife shall go out with him; for when he sits in the council he dishonours
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Lord loves holy hearts, and
  all blameless persons are acceptable with him: a king rules with his lips.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the eyes of the Lord preserve
  discretion; but the transgressor despises wise words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The sluggard makes excuses, and says, There is a
  lion in the ways, and murderers in the streets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The mouth of a transgressor is a deep pit; and he
  that is hated of the Lord shall fall into it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14a)</span> Evil ways are before a man, and he does not like
  to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn aside from a perverse and
  bad way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Folly is attached to the
  heart of a child, but the rod and instruction are then far from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He that oppresses the poor, increases
  his own substance, yet gives to the rich so as to make it less. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Incline thine ear to the words of wise men: hear
  also my word, and apply thine heart, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  that thou mayest know that they are good: and if thou lay them to heart, they
  shall also gladden thee on thy lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  That thy hope may be in the Lord, and he may make thy way known to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And do thou too repeatedly record
  them for thyself on the table of thine heart, for counsel and knowledge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I therefore teach thee truth, and
  knowledge good to hear; that thou mayest answer words of truth to them that
  question thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Do no violence to the
  poor, for he is needy: neither dishonour the helpless man in the gates.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the Lord will plead his cause,
  and thou shalt deliver thy soul in safety. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Be not companion to a furious man; neither lodge
  with a passionate man: <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> lest thou
  learn of his ways, and get snares to thy soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Become not surety from respect of a man’s person.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For if those have not whence to give
  compensation, they will take the bed that is under thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Remove not the old landmarks, which thy fathers
  placed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> It is fit that an observant
  man and one diligent in his business should attend on kings, and not attend
  on slothful men.
  <h3 id="proverbs23">23</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> If thou sit
  to sup at the table of a prince, consider attentively the things set before
  thee: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and apply thine hand, knowing
  that it behoves thee to prepare such meats: but if thou art very insatiable,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> desire not his provisions; for these
  belong to a false life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If thou art
  poor, measure not thyself with a rich man; but refrain thyself in thy wisdom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If thou shouldest fix thine eye upon
  him, he will disappear; for wings like an eagle’s are prepared for him, and
  he returns to the house of his master. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Sup not with an envious man, neither desire thou his meats: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7b)</span> and do not bring him in to thyself, nor eat thy
  morsel with him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7a)</span> so he eats and
  drinks as if any one should swallow a hair, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> for he will vomit it up, and spoil thy fair words.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Say nothing in the ears of a fool,
  lest at any time he sneer at thy wise words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Remove not the ancient landmarks; and enter not
  upon the possession of the fatherless: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> for the Lord is their redeemer; he is mighty, and
  will plead their cause with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Apply thine heart to instruction, and prepare thine ears for words of
  discretion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Refrain not from
  chastening a child; for if thou beat him with the rod, he shall not die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For thou shalt beat him with the rod,
  and shalt deliver his soul from death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Son, if thy heart be wise, thou shalt also
  gladden my heart; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and thy lips shall
  converse with my lips, if they be right. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in
  the fear of the Lord all the day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For
  if thou shouldest keep these things, thou shalt have posterity; and thine
  hope shall not be removed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Hear, my
  son, and be wise, and rightly direct the thoughts of thine heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Be not a wine-bibber, neither
  continue long at feasts, and purchases of flesh: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for every drunkard and whoremonger shall be poor;
  and every sluggard shall clothe himself with tatters and ragged garments.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Hearken, my son, to thy father which
  begot thee, and despise not thy mother because she is grown old. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A
  righteous father brings up his children well; and his soul rejoices over a
  wise son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Let thy father and thy
  mother rejoice over thee, and let her that bore thee be glad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes
  observe my ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For a strange house
  is a vessel full of holes; and a strange well is narrow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For such a one shall perish suddenly; and every
  transgressor shall be cut off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Who
  has woe? who trouble? who has quarrels? and who vexations and disputes? who
  has bruises without a cause? whose eyes are livid? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Are not those of them that stay long at wine? are
  not those of them that haunt the places where banquets are? Be not drunk with
  wine; but converse with just men, and converse with them openly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For if thou shouldest set thine eyes on bowls and
  cups, thou shalt afterwards go more naked than a pestle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But at last such a one stretches himself out as
  one smitten by a serpent, and venom is diffused through him as by a horned
  serpent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Whenever thine eyes shall
  behold a strange woman, then thy mouth shall speak perverse things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And thou shalt lie as in the midst of
  the sea, and as a pilot in a great storm. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And thou shalt say, They smote me, and I was not
  pained; and they mocked me, and I knew it not: when will it be morning, that
  I may go and seek those with whom I may go in company?
  <h3 id="proverbs24">24</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My son,
  envy not bad men, nor desire to be with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For their heart meditates falsehoods, and their
  lips speak mischiefs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> A house is built
  by wisdom, and is set up by understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> By discretion the chambers are filled with all
  precious and excellent wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> A wise
  man is better than a strong man; and a man who has prudence than a large
  estate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> War is carried on with
  generalship, and aid is supplied to the heart of a counsellor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wisdom and good understanding are in the gates of
  the wise: the wise turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7a)</span> but deliberate in council. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Death befalls uninstructed men. The fools also
  dies in sins; and uncleanness attaches to a pestilent man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He shall be defiled in the evil day, and in the
  day of affliction, until he be utterly consumed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Deliver them that are led away to death, and
  redeem them that are appointed to be slain; spare not thy help. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But if thou shouldest say, I know not this man;
  know that the Lord knows the hearts of all; and he that formed breath for
  all, he knows all things, who renders to every man according to his works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My son, eat honey, for the honeycomb
  is good, that thy throat may be sweetened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus shalt thou perceive wisdom in thy soul: for
  if thou find it, thine end shall be good, and hope shall not fail thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Bring not an ungodly man into the
  dwelling of the righteous: neither be deceived by the feeding of the belly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For a righteous man will fall seven
  times, and rise again: but the ungodly shall be without strength in troubles.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If thine enemy should fall, rejoice
  not over him, neither be elated at his overthrow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the Lord will see it, and it will not please
  him, and he will turn away his wrath from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Rejoice not in evil-doers, neither be envious of
  sinners. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the evil man shall have
  no posterity: and the light of the wicked shall be put out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> My son, fear God and the king; and do not disobey
  either of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For they will
  suddenly punish the ungodly, and who can know the vengeance inflicted by
  both? (22a) A son that keeps the commandment shall escape destruction; for
  such an one has fully received it. (22b) Let no falsehood be spoken by the
  king from the tongue; yea, let no falsehood proceed from his tongue. (22c)
  The king’s tongue is a sword, and not one of flesh; and whosoever shall be
  given up to it shall be destroyed: (22d) for if his wrath should be provoked,
  he destroys men with cords, (22e) and devours men’s bones, and burns them up
  as a flame, so that they are not even fit to be eaten by the young eagles.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:1)</span> These things says the man to them that trust in
  God; and I cease. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:2)</span> For I am the most
  simple of all men, and there is not in me the wisdom of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:3)</span> God has taught me wisdom, and I know the
  knowledge of the holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:4)</span> Who has gone
  up to heaven, and come down? who has gathered the winds in his bosom? who has
  wrapped up the waters in a garment? who has dominion of all the ends of the
  earth? what is his name? or what is the name of his children? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:5)</span> For all the words of God are tried in the fire,
  and he defends those that reverence him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:6)</span> Add not unto his words, lest he reprove thee,
  and thou be made a liar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:7)</span> Two things
  I ask of thee; take not favour from me before I die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:8)</span> Remove far from me vanity and falsehood: and
  give me not wealth or poverty; but appoint me what is needful and sufficient:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:9)</span> lest I be filled and become false,
  and say, Who sees me? or be poor and steal, and swear vainly by the name of
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:10)</span> Deliver not a servant into
  the hands of his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be utterly destroyed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:11)</span> A wicked generation curse their
  father, and do not bless their mother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:12)</span> A wicked generation judge themselves to be
  just, but do not cleanse their way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:13)</span> A wicked generation have lofty eyes, and exalt
  themselves with their eyelids. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:14)</span> A
  wicked generation have swords for teeth and jaw-teeth as knives, so as to
  destroy and devour the lowly from the earth, and the poor of them from among
  men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And this thing I say to you that
  are wise for you to learn: It is not good to have respect of persons in
  judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He that says of the
  ungodly, He is righteous, shall be cursed by peoples, and hateful among the
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But they that reprove him
  shall appear more excellent, and blessing shall come upon them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and men will kiss lips that answer well.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Prepare thy works for thy going
  forth, and prepare thyself for the field; and come after me, and thou shalt
  rebuild thine house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Be not a false
  witness against thy fellow citizen, neither exaggerate with thy lips.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Say not, As he has treated me, so
  will I treat him, and I will avenge myself on him for that wherein he has
  injured me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> A foolish man is like a
  farm, and a senseless man is like a vineyard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> If thou let him alone, he will altogether remain
  barren and covered with weeds; and he becomes destitute, and his stone walls
  are broken down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Afterwards I
  reflected, I looked that I might receive instruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The sluggard says,I slumber a little, and I sleep
  a little, and for a little while I fold my arms across my breast.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But if thou do this, thy poverty will
  come speedily; and thy want like a swift courier. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:15)</span> The horse-leech had three dearly-beloved
  daughters: and these three did not satisfy her; and the fourth was not
  contented so as to say, Enough. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:16)</span>
  The grave, and the love of a woman, and the earth not filled with water;
  water also and fire will not say, It is enough. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:17)</span> The eye that laughs to scorn a father, and
  dishonours the old age of a mother, let the ravens of the valleys pick it
  out, and let the young eagles devour it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:18)</span> Moreover there are three things impossible for
  me to comprehend, and the fourth I know not: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:19)</span> the track of a flying eagle; and the ways of a
  serpent on a rock; and the paths of a ship passing through the sea; and the
  ways of a man in youth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:20)</span> Such is
  the way of an adulterous woman, who having washed herself from what she has
  done, says she has done nothing amiss. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:21)</span> By three thing the earth is troubled, and the
  fourth it cannot bear: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:22)</span> if a
  servant reign; or a fool be filled with food; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:23)</span> or if a maid-servant should cast out her own
  mistress; and if a hateful woman should marry a good man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:24)</span> And there are four very little things upon the
  earth, but these are wiser than the wise: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:25)</span> the ants which are weak, and yet prepare their
  food in summer; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:26)</span> the rabbits also
  are a feeble race, who make their houses in the rocks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:27)</span> The locusts have no king, and yet march
  orderly at one command. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:28)</span> And the
  eft, which supports itself by its hands, and is easily taken, dwells in the
  fortresses of kings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:29)</span> And there are
  three things which go well, and a fourth which passes along finely.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:30)</span> A lion’s whelp, stronger than all
  other beasts, which turns not away, nor fears any beast; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30:31)</span> and a cock walking in boldly among the hens,
  and the goat leading the herd; and a king publicly speaking before a nation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:32)</span> If thou abandon thyself to mirth,
  and stretch forth thine hand in a quarrel, thou shalt be disgraced.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30:33)</span> Milk out milk, and there shall be
  butter, and if thou wing one’s nostrils there shall come out blood: so if
  thou extort words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:1)</span> My words have been spoken by God - the oracular
  answer of a king, whom his mother instructed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:2)</span> What wilt thou keep, my son, what? the words of
  God. My firstborn son, I speak to thee: what? son of my womb? what? son of my
  vows? <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:3)</span> Give not thy wealth to women,
  nor thy mind and living to remorse. Do all things with counsel: drink wine
  with counsel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:4)</span> Princes are prone to
  anger: let them then not drink wine: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:5)</span> lest they drink, and forget wisdom, and be not
  able to judge the poor rightly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:6)</span>
  Give strong drink to those that are in sorrow, and the wine to drink to those
  in pain: <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:7)</span> that they may forget their
  poverty, and may not remember their troubles any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:8)</span> Open thy mouth with the word of God, and judge
  all fairly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:9)</span> Open thy mouth and
  judge justly, and plead the cause of the poor and weak.
  <h3 id="proverbs25">25</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> These are
  the miscellaneous instructions of Solomon, which the friends of Ezekias king
  of Judea copied out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The glory of God
  conceals a matter: but the glory of a king honours business. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Heaven is high, and earth is deep, and a king’s
  heart is unsearchable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Beat the drossy
  silver, and it shall be made entirely pure. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Slay the ungodly from before the king, and his
  throne shall prosper in righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Be not boastful in the presence of the king, and remain not in the places of
  princes; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for it is better for thee
  that it should be said, Come up to me, than that one should humble thee in
  the presence of the prince; speak of that which thine eyes have seen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Get not suddenly into a quarrel, lest
  thou repent at last. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Whenever thy
  friend shall reproach thee, retreat backward, despise him not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> lest thy friend continue to reproach thee, so thy
  quarrel and enmity shall not depart, but shall be to thee like death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10a)</span> Favour and friendship set a man
  free, which do thou keep for thyself, lest thou be made liable to reproach;
  but take heed to thy ways peaceably. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  As a golden apple in a necklace of sardius, so is it to speak a wise word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> In an ear-ring of gold a precious
  sardius is also set; so is a wise word to an obedient ear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> As a fall of snow in the time of harvest is good
  against heat, so a faithful messenger refreshes those that send him; for he
  helps the souls of his employers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> As
  winds and clouds and rains are most evident objects, so is he that boasts of
  a false gift. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> In long-suffering is
  prosperity to kings, and a soft tongue breaks the bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Having found honey, eat only what is enough, lest
  haply thou be filled, and vomit it up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Enter sparingly into thy friend’s house, lest he
  be satiated with thy company, and hate thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> As a club, and a dagger, and a pointed arrow, so
  also is a man who bears false witness against his friend. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The way of the wicked and the foot of the
  transgressor shall perish in an evil day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As vinegar is bad for a sore, so trouble
  befalling the body afflicts the heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20a)</span> As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so
  the grief of a man hurts the heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> for so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon
  his head, and the Lord shall reward thee with good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The north wind raises clouds; so an impudent face
  provokes the tongue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> It is better to
  dwell on a corner of the roof, than with a railing woman in an open house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> As cold water is agreeable to a
  thirsting soul, so is a good message from a land far off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> As if one should stop a well, and corrupt a
  spring of water, so is it unseemly for a righteous man to fall before an
  ungodly man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> It is not good to eat
  much honey; but it is right to honour venerable sayings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> As a city whose walls are broken down, and which
  is unfortified, so is a man who does anything without counsel.
  <h3 id="proverbs26">26</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> As dew in
  harvest, and as rain in summer, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> As birds and sparrows fly, so a curse
  shall not come upon any one without a cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> As a whip for a horse, and a goad for an ass, so
  is a rod for a simple nation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Answer
  not a fool according to his folly, lest thou become like him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Yet answer a fool according to his folly, lest he
  seem wise in his own conceit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He that
  sends a message by a foolish messenger procures for himself a reproach from
  his own ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> As well take away the
  motion of the legs, as transgression from the mouth of fools. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He that binds up a stone in a sling, is like one
  that gives glory to a fool. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thorns
  grow in the hand of a drunkard, and servitude in the hand of fools.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> All the flesh of fools endures much
  hardship; for their fury is brought to nought. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> As when a dog goes to his own vomit, and becomes
  abominable, so is fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11a)</span> There is a shame that brings sin:
  and there is a shame that is glory and grace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I have seen a man who seemed to himself to be
  wise; but a fool had more hope than he. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> A sluggard when sent on a journey says, There is
  a lion in the ways, and there are murderers in the streets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> As a door turns on the hinge, so does a sluggard
  on his bed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> A sluggard having hid his
  hand in his bosom, will not be able to bring it up to his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> A sluggard seems to himself wiser than one who
  most satisfactorily brings back a message. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> As he that lays hold of a dog’s tail, so is he
  that makes himself the champion of another’s cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> As those who need correction put forth fair words
  to men, and he that first falls in with the proposal will be overthrown;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> so are all that lay wait for their
  own friends, and when they are discovered, say, I did it in jest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> With much wood fire increases; but
  where there is not a double-minded man, strife ceases. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> A hearth for coals, and wood for fire; and
  railing man for the tumult of strife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  The words of cunning knaves are soft; but they smite even to the inmost parts
  of the bowels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Silver dishonestly
  given is to be considered as a potsherd: smooth lips cover a grievous heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> A weeping enemy promises all things
  with his lips, but in his heart he contrives deceit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Though thine enemy intreat thee with a loud
  voice, consent not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He that hides enmity frames deceit:
  but being easily discerned, exposes his own sins in the public assemblies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He that digs a pit for his neighbour
  shall fall into it: and he that rolls a stone, rolls it upon himself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> A lying tongue hates the truth; and
  an unguarded mouth causes tumults.
  <h3 id="proverbs27">27</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Boast not
  of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what the next day shall bring forth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let thy neighbour, and not thine own
  mouth, praise thee; a stranger, and not thine own lips. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> A stone is heavy, and sand cumbersome; but a
  fool’s wrath is heavier than both. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Wrath is merciless, and anger sharp: but envy can bear nothing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Open reproofs are better than secret love.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The wounds of a friend are more to be
  trusted than the spontaneous kisses of an enemy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> A full soul scorns honeycombs; but to a hungry
  soul even bitter things appear sweet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so a man is brought into bondage
  whenever he estranges himself from his own place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The heart delights in ointments and wines and
  perfumes: but the soul is broken by calamities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend,
  forsake not; and when thou art in distress go not into thy brother’s house:
  better is a friend that is near than a brother living far off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Son, be wise, that thy heart may rejoice; and
  remove thou from thyself reproachful words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> A wise man, when evils are approaching, hides
  himself; but fools pass on, and will be punished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Take away the man’s garment, (for a scorner has
  passed by) whoever lays waste another’s goods. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Whosoever shall bless a friend in the morning
  with a loud voice, shall seem to differ nothing from one who curses him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> On a stormy day drops of rain drive a
  man out of his house; so also does a railing woman drive a man out of his own
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The north wind is sharp, but
  it is called by name propitious. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Iron
  sharpens iron; and a man sharpens his friend’s countenance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He that plants a fig-tree shall eat the fruits of
  it: so he that waits on his own master shall be honoured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> As faces are not like other faces, so neither are
  the thoughts of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Hell and
  destruction are not filled; so also are the eyes of men insatiable.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20a)</span> He that fixes his eye is an
  abomination to the Lord; and the uninstructed do not restrain their tongue.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Fire is the trial for silver and
  gold; and a man is tried by the mouth of them that praise him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21a)</span> The heart of the transgressor seeks after
  mischiefs; but an upright heart seeks knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Though thou scourge a fool, disgracing him in the
  midst of the council, thou wilt still in no wise remove his folly from him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Do thou thoroughly know the number of
  thy flock, and pay attention to thine herds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For a man has not strength and power for ever;
  neither does he transmit it from generation to generation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Take care of the herbage in the field, and thou
  shalt cut grass, and gather the mountain hay; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> that thou mayest have wool of sheep for clothing:
  pay attention to the land, that thou mayest have lambs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> My son, thou hast from me words very useful for
  thy life, and for the life of thy servants.
  <h3 id="proverbs28">28</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The ungodly
  man flees when no one pursues: but the righteous is confident as a lion.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> By reason of the sins of ungodly men
  quarrels arise; but a wise man will quell them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> A bold man oppresses the poor by ungodly deeds. As
  an impetuous and profitable rain, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> so
  they that forsake the law praise ungodliness; but they that love the law
  fortify themselves with a wall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Evil
  men will not understand judgment: but they that seek the Lord will understand
  everything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> A poor man walking in
  truth is better than a rich liar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> A
  wise son keeps the law: but he that keeps up debauchery dishonours his
  father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He that increases his wealth
  by usuries and unjust gains, gathers it for him that pities the poor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He that turns away his ear from
  hearing the law, even he has made his prayer abominable. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He that causes upright men to err in an evil way,
  himself shall fall into destruction: transgressor also shall pass by
  prosperity, but shall not enter into it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> A rich man is wise in his own conceit; but an
  intelligent poor man will condemn him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> By reason of the help of righteous men great
  glory arises: but in the places of the ungodly men are caught. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He that covers his own ungodliness shall not
  prosper: but he that blames himself shall be loved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Blessed is the man who religiously fears always:
  but the hard of heart shall fall into mischiefs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> A hungry lion and a thirsty wolf is he, who,
  being poor, rules over a poor nation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  A king in need of revenues is a great oppressor: but he that hates injustice
  shall live a long time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He that
  becomes surety for a man charged with murder shall be an exile, and not in
  safety. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17a)</span> Chasten thy son, and he
  shall love thee, and give honour to thy soul: he shall not obey a sinful
  nation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He that walks justly is
  assisted: but he that walks in crooked ways shall be entangled therein.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He that tills his own land shall be
  satisfied with bread: but he that follows idleness shall have plenty of
  poverty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> A man worthy of credit shall
  be much blessed: but the wicked shall not be unpunished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He that reverences not the persons of the just is
  not good: such a one will sell a man for a morsel of bread. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> An envious man makes haste to be rich, and knows
  not that the merciful man will have the mastery over him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He that reproves a man’s ways shall have more
  favour than he that flatters with the tongue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He that casts off father or mother, and thinks he
  sins not; the same is partaker with an ungodly man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> An unbelieving man judges rashly: but he that
  trusts in the Lord will act carefully. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He that trusts to a bold heart, such an one is a
  fool: but he that walks in wisdom shall be safe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He that gives to the poor shall not be in want:
  but he that turns away his eye from him shall be in great distress.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In the places of ungodly men the
  righteous mourn: but in their destruction the righteous shall be multiplied.
  <h3 id="proverbs29">29</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A reprover
  is better than a stiff-necked man: for when the latter is suddenly set on
  fire, there shall be no remedy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> When
  the righteous are praised, the people will rejoice: but when the ungodly
  rule, men mourn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> When a man loves
  wisdom, his father rejoices: but he that keeps harlots will waste wealth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> A righteous king establishes a
  country: but a transgressor destroys it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He that prepares a net in the way of his own
  friend, entangles his own feet in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  A great snare is spread for a sinner: but the righteous shall be in joy and
  gladness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> A righteous man knows how to
  judge for the poor: but the ungodly understands not knowledge; and the poor
  man has not an understanding mind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Lawless men burn down a city: but wise men turn away wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> A wise man shall judge nations: but a worthless
  man being angry laughs and fears not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Bloody men hate a holy person, but the upright will seek his soul.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> A fool utters all is mind: but the
  wise reserves his in part. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When a
  king hearkens to unjust language, all his subjects are transgressors.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> When the creditor and debtor meet
  together, the Lord oversees them both. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> When a king judges the poor in truth, his throne
  shall be established for a testimony. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Stripes and reproofs give wisdom: but an erring child disgraces his parents.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> When the ungodly abound, sins abound:
  but when they fall, the righteous are warned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Chasten thy son, and he shall give thee rest; and
  he shall give honour to thy soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  There shall be no interpreter to a sinful nation: but he that observes the
  law is blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A stubborn servant
  will not be reproved by words: for even if he understands, still he will not
  obey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If thou see a man hasty in his
  words, know that the fool has hope rather than he. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He that lives wantonly from a child, shall be a
  servant, and in the end shall grieve over himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> A furious man stirs up strife, and a passionate
  man digs up sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Pride brings a man
  low, but the Lord upholds the humble-minded with honour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He that shares with a thief, hates his own soul:
  and if any having heard an oath uttered tell not of it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> they fearing and reverencing men unreasonably
  have been overthrown, but he that trusts in the Lord shall rejoice.
  Ungodliness causes a man to stumble: but he that trusts in his master shall
  be safe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Many wait on the favour of
  rulers; but justice comes to a man from the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> A righteous man is an abomination to an
  unrighteous man, and the direct way is an abomination to the sinner.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:10)</span> Who shall find a virtuous woman?
  for such a one is more valuable than precious stones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:11)</span> The heart of her husband trusts in her: such a
  one shall stand in no need of fine spoils. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:12)</span> For she employs all her living for her
  husband’s good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:13)</span> Gathering wool and
  flax, she makes it serviceable with her hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:14)</span> She is like a ship trading from a distance: so
  she procures her livelihood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:15)</span> And
  she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and appointed tasks to
  her maidens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:16)</span> She views a farm, and
  buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants and a possession.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:17)</span> She strongly girds her loins, and
  strengthens her arms for work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:18)</span> And
  she finds by experience that working is good; and her candle goes not out all
  night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:19)</span> She reaches forth her arms
  to needful works, and applies her hands to the spindle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:20)</span> And she opens her hands to the needy, and
  reaches out fruit to the poor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:21)</span> Her
  husband is not anxious about those at home when he tarries anywhere abroad:
  for all her household are clothed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:22)</span>
  She makes for her husband clothes of double texture, and garments for herself
  of fine linen and scarlet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:23)</span> And her
  husband becomes a distinguished person in the gates, when he sits in council
  with the old inhabitants of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:24)</span> She makes fine linens, and sells girdles to
  the Chananites: she opens her mouth heedfully and with propriety, and
  controls her tongue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:25)</span> She puts on
  strength and honour; and rejoices in the last days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:27)</span> The ways of her household are careful, and she
  eats not the bread of idleness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:26)</span>
  But she opens her mouth wisely, and according to law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:28)</span> And her kindness to them sets up her children
  for them, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31:29)</span> Many daughters have obtained wealth, many have
  wrought valiantly; but thou hast exceeded, thou hast surpassed all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:30)</span> Charms are false, and woman’s
  beauty is vain: for it is a wise woman that is blessed, and let her praise
  the fear the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31:31)</span> Give her of the
  fruit of her lips; and let her husband be praised in the gates.
