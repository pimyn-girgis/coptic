  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews1">1</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In many manners and many forms from
  (the) beginning God spake to our fathers from the prophets, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> but at (the) end of these days he spake to us in a
  Son, he whom he appointed heir of all, and through him he made the ages;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> who himself is the splendour of his
  glory, and (the) form of his substance, upholding (the) universe by (the)
  word of his power. Through him he made a cleansing of the sins. He sat on the
  right hand of the greatness on high; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  having become better than the angels by so much, as he inherited a name being
  different from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For to whom at
  any time among the angels said he: 'Thou art my Son, I (pron.) begat thee
  to-day'? and again: 'I (pron.) shall be to him a Father, and he (pron.) shall
  be to me for a Son'? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But when again he
  bringeth the firstborn into the world, he is saying: Let the angels of God
  all worship him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And concerning the
  angels he saith: He who made his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of
  fire.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But concerning (the) Son he
  saith: Thy throne, (O) God, unto age of the age, and (the) staff of (the)
  straightness is (the) staff of thy kingdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Because thou lovedst [the] righteousness and thou
  hatedst (the) injustice, therefore God, thy God, anointed thee with an oil of
  gladness rather than they who are thy fellows' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And, From (the) beginning, Lord, thou (pron.)
  laidest foundation of (the) earth, and the heavens are the works of thy
  hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They (pron.) will perish, but
  thou (pron.) abidest, and they all will become old as a garment: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> as a cloke thou wilt roll them up, and they will
  be changed, but thou art thou, and thy years fail not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For to whom at any time among the angels said he:
  Sit on my right hand, until I put thine enemies below thy feet?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Are not all these ministering spirits, sent unto
  a service because of them who will inherit [a] salvation?</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore it is right that we
  should give more heed to the things which we heard, lest haply we decline
  from (them). <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For if the word which he
  spake through the angels became established, and every transgression and
  every disobedience received a recompence in a worthy judgement; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> how shall (lit. will) we (pron.) be able to
  escape, should we neglect this great salvation? That which took beginning of
  being spoken about through the Lord by them who heard, and it was confirmed
  unto us; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> God witnessing with them, in
  signs and wonders and powers of many kinds, and distributions of the holy
  spirit according to his will. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For he
  made not the world subject to the angels, that which cometh, this concerning
  which we speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For one somewhere
  witnessed to us, saying: 'Who is (the) man, that thou rememberedst him, or
  (the) son of (the) man, that thou visitedst him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou humiliatedst him a little (lower) than the
  angels; (the) glory and (the) honour thou gavest as a crown upon him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou settest him up over the works
  of thy hands: thou madest all things subject below his feet.' For having made
  all things subject to him, then he left not anything without being subject to
  him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But he whom he humiliated a little (lower) than
  the angels--we see Jesus, because of the pain of (the) death he put (lit. did
  the) glory and (the) honour as (ft) a crown upon him, that in the grace of
  God he might taste (the) death for all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For it was being worthy for him because of whom
  were all things and through whom were all things, having brought many sons
  into [a] glory, even (the) author of their salvation, to be completed through
  pains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he who sanctifieth and
  they who are sanctified are all from one: therefore he is not ashamed calling
  them, My brethren.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Saying: I shall
  (lit. will) say thy name to my brethren, in (the) midst of the church I shall
  (lit. will) bless thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he saith
  again: I shall be trusting in him.' And again he saith also (on): Behold, I
  and the children whom God gave to me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Since then the children shared in blood and
  flesh, so he also shared in such things; that through his death he might do
  away with him who had (the) strength of (the) death, who is the devil,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and might restore these. They who
  being in the fear of (the) death were incurring [a] servitude all their
  lifetime. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For he put (lit. threw) not
  his hand unto angels [together], but (the) seed of Abraam (is) that unto
  which he put his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore it
  is worthy that he should be like to his brethren in all things, that he might
  be merciful and high priest faithful toward God, for him to forgive the sins
  of the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For in that in which
  he suffered and which he was tempted, it is possible for him to help them who
  are tempted.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore, my brethren, holy, and
  sharing in the calling of (the) heaven, consider the apostle and high priest
  of our confession, Jesus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> he who was
  faithful to him who made him, according as also Moses over his house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For this (one) was worthy of more
  honour than Moses, according as he who made it hath more honour than the
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For all houses are prepared by
  (some) one, but he who made all things is God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Moses indeed is faithful in all his house as a
  servant unto a witnessing of the things which are spoken; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but Christ as a Son over his house; whose house
  are we, if we should lay hold on the boldness and the boast of the hope firm
  unto the end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> According as the holy
  spirit saith: 'To-day, if ye should hear his voice, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> let not your hearts harden, as in the anger,
  according to the day of the temptation in (the) desert, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that in which your fathers tempted me in a
  probation; they saw my works <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> forty
  years. Therefore I hated that generation, and I said that they go astray in
  their heart always: but they (pron.) knew not my ways; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> as I sware in mine anger: "Will they go into my
  rest?"' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Take heed, my brethren, lest
  haply there should be an evil heart in one of you of unbelief to make you
  withdraw from the living God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> but
  comfort one another daily, as long as it is called 'To-day,' that one of you
  might not be hardened in a deceit of (the) sin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For we were sharers of Christ if we should lay
  hold on (the) beginning of the confidence firm unto the end: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> in (the) saying 'To-day, if ye should hear his
  voice, let not your hearts harden, as in the anger,' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> for some having heard caused anger, but not all
  who came out of Khēmi through Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  But who were they with whom he was displeased forty years? Was it not they
  who sinned, whose limbs fell in (the) desert? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But who were they to whom he sware not to come
  into his rest? Was it not they who were disobedient? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And we see that they could not come in because of
  their unbelief.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Let us then fear lest haply, a
  promise having been left for coming into his rest, one of you seem to come
  short. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For good tidings were preached
  to us also as to those, but the word of the hearing profited those not,
  because they were not persuaded in the faith with those who heard.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> We shall (lit. will) then go into the
  rest, namely they who believed, according as be said: As I sware in mine
  anger, "Shall they go into my rest?"' although the works were done from (the)
  foundation of the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For he said
  thus in a place concerning the seventh day: God rested in the seventh day
  from all his works'; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and in this
  (place) again: 'Will they go into my rest ?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Since then he leaveth some to come into it, and
  the first to whom good tidings were preached went not in because of their
  unbelief, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> again he ordaineth a day,
  to-day, in David, after so much time, saying according as he said from (the)
  first: 'To-day, if ye should hear his voice, let not your hearts harden.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For had Jēsou made them rest, he would
  not have spoken concerning another day after these things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> So then a keeping of Sabbath is left to the people
  of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For he who came into his
  rest, himself also rested from his works, as God rested from his own.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let us hasten then to come into that
  rest, that one may not fall down in the same form of the disobedience.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For the word of God is faithful, and
  it worketh, and it is sharper than every sword of two edges (lit. mouth), and
  it goeth in up to the dividing of the soul and the spirit, and the joints and
  the marrow, and it is searching for the reasonings and the thoughts of heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there is not any creature hidden
  before him, but all are naked, and they are with bare neck before his eyes,
  he unto whom the word reacheth for us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Having then a great high priest who passed
  (through) the heavens, Jesus (the) Son of God, let us lay hold on the
  confession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For (it is) not an high
  priest which we have, for whom it is not possible to suffer with our
  weaknesses; but (one) who was tempted in everything according to our form,
  without sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Let us come in boldly
  before the throne of the grace, that we may receive [a] mercy and find [a]
  grace for an occasion of help.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For every high priest who is taken
  from [the] men, they set him up for [the] men with God, that he may offer
  gift and sacrifice for the sins; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> (one)
  for whom it is possible to suffer in a measure with the ignorant and who are
  gone astray, because himself also is in [a] weakness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and because of it it is meet for him, according as
  he offereth for the things of the people, thus also that he should offer for
  his own sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And (any) one taketh not
  the honour to himself, but God called him according as Aaron. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus also Christ glorified not himself, to be made
  (an) high priest, but he it is who spake to him: 'Thou art my Son, I (pron.)
  begat thee to-day.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> According as he
  saith in another place: Thou art (the) priest for ever, according to (the)
  order of Melchisedek.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He who offered
  in the days of his flesh prayers and supplications to him for whom it was
  possible to save him from (the) death; with a strong cry and tears having
  offered them: and he heard him from (the) fear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Though he was a son, he knew [the] obedience from
  the pains which he received; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and
  having been completed, he became to all who will obey him a cause of eternal
  salvation; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> God having called him
  'High priest for ever, according to (the) order of Melchisedek.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He concerning whom the word is great for us, and
  it is difficult of interpretation, because ye become weak in your hearings.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For (when) it even was being worthy
  for you to be teachers because of the time; ye again have need of (one) to
  teach you what are the elements of (the) beginning of the words of God; and
  ye become having need of [a] milk, not [a] strong food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For every one who eateth milk is not experienced
  in (the) word of the righteousness; for he is a child. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the strong food is that of the perfect, they
  who because of their habit have their perception (plur.) experienced for
  (the) knowing (the) difference of the good and the evil.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore having left (the) word of
  (the) beginning of Christ, let us come unto the completion, not having
  deposited for us a foundation of [a] repentance from dead works, and [a]
  faith in God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and [a] doctrine of
  baptisms, and [a] laying on of hand upon them, and [a] resurrection of the
  dead, and [an] eternal judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  this we shall do if the Lord should command. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For it is an impossibility (for them) who once
  received (the) light, having tasted free gift of (the) heaven, and they
  shared in the holy spirit, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and they
  tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age which cometh,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and fell (away), that they should
  become new again unto a repentance, crucifying (the) Son of God to themselves
  once more, they make him as public example. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the earth which drinketh the rain which cometh
  down upon it many times, bearing [a] grass good for them for whom it was
  cultivated, receiveth the blessing of God: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but should it bring forth thorns and thistles it
  is unprofitable, and draweth near unto (the) curse, whose end will be unto
  (the) burning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But we are persuaded
  concerning you, my beloved, as to the things which are best and the things
  which draw near unto [the] salvation, even if we thus make (the) speech:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for God is not a wrongdoer, that he
  should forget your work and (the) toil of your love, this which ye manifested
  in his name, having ministered to the saints, and ye minister still.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But we wish that each one of you may
  manifest the same diligence in (the) fulfilment of this hope unto (the) last:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that ye be not weak, but that ye be
  like to them who inherited the promises through (the) faith and [the]
  longsuffering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For God having
  promised to Abraam, since there was not another exalted (one) to swear by
  him, he sware by himself, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> saying: In
  a blessing I shall (lit. will) bless thee, and in a multiplying I shall (lit.
  will) cause thy seed to multiply.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And thus having suffered long he obtained the promise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For indeed [the] men swear by the greater than
  them: and (the) finishing of all controversy (for) a confirMatthewion to them
  is the oath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But in this, God wishing
  the more to show to the heirs of the promise the immoveability of his
  counsel, mediated in an oath: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> that,
  through two immoveable things, [these] in which it was not possible that God
  should say falsehood, we might have a strong comfort, namely those who fled
  to him to lay hold on the hope which is set before us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This which we have as an anchor of our soul,
  being unfailing and firm and going in unto the things which are within the
  veil; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> the place into which Jesus went
  in, being (the) forerunner for us, having become an high priest for ever
  according to (the) order of Melchisedek.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For this Melchisedek, (the) king of
  Salēm, the priest of God most high, he who met Abraam returning from (the)
  slaughter of the kings, and he blessed him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to whom Abraam divided (a) tenth from everything
  of his,-first indeed being interpreted, (the) king of [the] righteousness';
  after it, '(the) king of Salēm,' that is to say, '(the) king of [the] peace';
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> fatherless, motherless (he) is, not a
  word as to generation is (there) of his; he hath not beginning of day, nor
  hath he end of life; but he is likened unto (the) Son of God; he remaineth
  priest for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But see how great is
  this (one), to whom Abraam gave (a) tenth from the choice things of his, the
  patriarch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they indeed from the
  sons of Levi, about to receive the priesthood, have commandment delivered
  unto them to receive (a) tenth from the people according to the law, who are
  their brethren, although they came from the loins of Abraam: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> for he whose generation from them was not spoken
  of, received (a) tenth from Abraam, and he blessed him who had the promises.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But without all controversy the little
  is blessed by the greater than him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And here men who die receive tenths; but there it is witnessed of him that he
  liveth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And as to say a word, because
  of Abraam, Levi also indeed, who was (to) receive tenths, gave (a) tenth;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for he was yet in the loins of Abraam
  when Melehisedek met him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If indeed
  then (the) completion was being through the priesthood of the Levite; for law
  was given to the people in its time; then what was (the) need for there to be
  another priest according to (the) order of Melchisedek, and not to say,
  'According to (the) order of Aaron?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  For the priesthood being about to be removed, necessarily there is a removing
  of the law also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For he concerning
  whom these things are said belonged to another tribe, that (lit. this) from
  which no one attended at the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  For it is manifest from (the) first, that our Lord sprang from Jouda; that
  tribe from which Moses said not anything concerning priest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it is yet even the more manifested, if
  according to (the) form of Melchisedek will arise another priest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He who was made not according to a
  law of a carnal commandment, but according to a power of an indissoluble
  life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For it is witnessed of him:
  'Thou art (the) priest for ever, according to (the) order of Melchisedek.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For indeed there will be a rejection
  of the first commandment because of its weakness and its unprofitableness,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> for the law completed not anything. A
  way of coming in is this, of a better (lit. chosen) hope, this through which
  we shall (lit. will) draw near unto God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and according as it is not without oath. For
  those indeed were made priest without oath, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but this one indeed with an oath through him who
  saith to him: The Lord sware and shall not repent, "Thou art (the) priest for
  ever."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> According to so much was made
  Jesus (the) surety of a better (lit. chosen) covenant which was established
  with law upon better (chosen) promises. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they indeed were made priest, being many (of
  them), because (the) death was not letting them stay. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But this (one) because he will stay for ever
  received the priesthood without passing to another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore it is possible for him to save always
  them who come to God through him. Living always to intercede for them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For an high priest of this kind was
  being comely for us, honourable, without evil, undefiled, separated from the
  sinners; and he was exalted above the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He for whom there is not [given] necessity (to
  offer) daily as the high priests who offer sacrifice first for their own
  sins, after it they offer for those of the people: for this he did, having
  offered himself once. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For the law
  appointeth men as high priest, they having weakness; but the word of the
  oath, this which was after the law, setteth up a Son completed for ever.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But (the) summing up of the things
  which we say (is this). For an high priest of this kind we have, he who sat
  (down) at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> as minister of the holy things, and of
  the true tabernacle which the Lord made firm, and not man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer gift
  and sacrifice: therefore it is necessary for there to be something for this
  (one) to offer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If indeed then he was
  being on (the) earth, then he would (lit. was) not be a priest, there being
  those who offer gift according to the law; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> these who minister in a form and a shadow of the
  things of (the) heaven, according as it was shown to Moses, being about to
  complete the tabernacle: for, See, he said, thou shalt make all things
  according to the pattern which was shown to thee on the mountain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But now he acquired a service much
  better, as also he is mediator of a better covenant, which was established
  with law upon better promises. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For had
  that first one been faultless, (the) place of the second would not have been
  sought for. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For he is finding. fault
  with them, saying: 'Lo, days come, said the Lord, I shall (lit. will)
  complete upon (the) house of Israel and upon (the) house of Jouda a new
  covenant; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> not according to the
  covenant which I established with their fathers in the day (in) which I took
  hold of their hand to bring them out of (the) land of Chēmi; because they
  (pron.) stayed not in my covenant, but I (pron.) neglected them, said the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because this is my covenant
  which I shall (lit. will) establish with (the) house of Israel after those
  days, said the Lord; I shall put (lit. give) my laws upon their thoughts, and
  I shall write them upon their hearts: and I (pron.) shall be to them as God,
  and they also shall be to me for a people: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and each one shall not teach his (fellow)
  citizen, and each one his brother, saying: "Know the Lord": because they will
  all know me from their little one to their great one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Because I shall (lit. will) forgive them their
  wrongdoing, and I shall not remember more their sins.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> In (the) saying 'new,' then he made the first
  old. But that which becometh old and becometh aged clraweth near unto (the)
  perishing.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The first indeed then (was) having
  ordinances of ministry and a holy (place) of ornament. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For the first tabernacle was fashioned, that in
  which (are) the lampstand, and the table, and the prothesis of the loaves;
  which is called, that which is holy.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  But after the second veil, the tabernacle, that which is called, that which
  is holy of those which are holy'; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> in
  which there is a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered with
  gold on every side. In which (are) the golden pot, the manna being in it, and
  the staff of Aaron which bloomed, and the tables of the covenant;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> but above it cherubims of (the) glory
  shadowing over the mercy-seat, these which are not at present to be spoken of
  severally; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but these being thus set in
  order. The first tabernacle indeed the priests go into it always, completing
  the ministries; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but to the second once
  a year the high priest alone, not without blood, this which he offereth for
  himself, and for the ignorances of the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But this the holy spirit is manifesting, that the
  way of the (places) which are holy was not yet manifested, the first
  tabernacle still abiding; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that which
  is likened to this time which (now) is; that during which are offered gift
  and sacrifice, it being not possible for them, according to conscience, to
  complete him who worshippeth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> (being)
  only with eatings and drinkings and various bathings, which were ordinances
  of (the) flesh until (the) time of the institution. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But Christ having come the high priest of the
  good things which will be, through the great tabernacle which is complete,
  not being fashioned with hand, that is to say, that it is not that of this
  creation, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> nor through (the) blood of
  goats is it and calves, but through his own blood came into the (places)
  which are holy once, having found an eternal redemption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For if (the) blood of goats and calves and ashes
  of an heifer sprinkled upon those who are unclean cleanseth unto (the)
  cleansing of the flesh: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> then how much
  more [is] (the) blood of Christ, he (lit. this) who through the holy spirit
  offered himself clean to God, will cleanse our conscience from the dead works
  to serve the living and true God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  therefore (he) is a mediator of a new covenant, that, a death having happened
  for a redemption of the transgressions which were during the first covenant,
  [that] they who are called may receive the promise of the eternal
  inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For where a testament
  is, it is necessary that there should be (the) death of him who established
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the testament (is) confirmed
  over dead (men): because it hath not power as long as liveth he who
  established it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Therefore neither the
  first was cleansed without blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For
  Moses having spoken to all the people every commandment according to the law,
  took [a] blood of calves and goats and [a] water and [a] scarlet wool and [a]
  hyssop, and both the book itself, and all the people he sprinkled, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> This is (the) blood of the covenant
  which God ordered you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the
  tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled thus with the
  blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Nearly all things are cleansed
  according to the law. with [a] blood, and without shedding blood forgiveness
  is not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> It was necessary indeed then
  that the forms of those which are in the heavens should be cleansed with
  these, but these themselves the (things) of the heavens with sacrifices
  better than these. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For Christ came
  not into holy (places) fashioned with hand, pattern of the true ones, but
  into (the) heaven itself, manifesting himself now before God for us:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> not that he may offer himself many
  times; as the high priest who cometh into the (places) which are holy (once)
  a year with [a] blood not his own; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  otherwise he ought to have suffered many times from (the) foundation of the
  world: but now once at (the) completion of the ages he manifested himself,
  that he might put away (the) sin through his sacrifice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And according as it is appointed for the men to
  die once, but after this a judgement; <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  thus also Christ offered himself once, that he might bear up (the) sins of
  many, but the second time he shall manifest himself without sin for [a]
  salvation of them who look out forward to him.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For (the) law having a shadow of
  the good (things) which come, being not the very image of these things,
  (going on year) by year in the same sacrifices, these which they offer
  continually; it is not possible for them ever to complete them who come in
  (to offer them). <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Otherwise would they
  not have ceased offering them? Because that they have not any conscience of
  sins, namely those who worshipped, having been once cleansed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But in them they were remembering the sins (year)
  by year. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For it is an impossibility
  for (the) blood of calves and goats to take away sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Therefore, coming into the world he saith: 'A
  sacrifice and an offering thou wishedst not, but a body thou preparedst for
  me, not, but a body hast thou prepared me: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> over holocausts and (offerings) because of (the)
  sin thou wast not well pleased: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> then I
  said: "Behold I come, in a volume of book it is written concerning me to do,
  God, thy will."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Above he saith:
  'Sacrifices, and offerings, and holocausts and (offerings) because of (the)
  sin thou wishedst not, nor wast well pleased over them,' which are those
  which are offered according to the law, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then he said: Behold I come to do thy will.' He
  doeth away with the first, that he may institute the second, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> this will in which we were sanctified through the
  offering of (the) body of Jesus Christ once. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And every priest is standing daily ministering,
  offering the same sacrifices many times, these for which it is not possible
  ever to take away sin: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> but he offered
  himself for our sins, one sacrifice; he sat on the right hand of God for
  ever; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> henceforth expecting until his
  enemies are put below his feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For
  one offering will complete them, who will be sanctified, for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For the holy spirit witnesseth to us;
  for after his saying: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> This (is) the
  covenant which I established with them after those days, said the Lord; I
  shall put (lit. give) my laws into (lit. down to) their heart, and I shall
  (lit. will) write them upon their thoughts; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and I shall not remember any more their sins and
  their lawlessnesses.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For where
  forgiveness of these (is), then there is not offering any more concerning
  (the) sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Having then, my brethren,
  boldness unto (the) way of the (places) which are holy in (the) blood of
  Jesus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> that which he made new for us,
  the new and living way through the veil which is his flesh; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and a great priest over (the) house of God;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let us come in with a true heart and
  [a] fulness of [a] faith, our hearts being sprinkled from evil conscience:
  and our bodies washed in [a] pure water, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> let us lay hold on the confession of the hope
  without wavering, for faithful is he who promised: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> let us observe one another in [a] zeal of [a]
  love and good works; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And not forsake
  our synagogue according as (the) custom of some is, but exhorting so much the
  more as ye see that the day drew near. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For if we should sin willingly after we receive
  (the) knowledge of the truth, there is not sacrifice left any more concerning
  sins, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> but a looking out for [a]
  judgement which is fearful, and a jealousy of [a] fire about to consume them
  who are against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Should any one
  reject (the) law of Moses, without compassion on (the word of) two or three
  witnesses he dieth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Then of how much
  worse torment, think ye, that he will be worthy, who will trample upon (the)
  Son of God; and he esteemed (the) blood of the covenant that it is unclean,
  that in which he was sanctified, and he insulted the spirit of the grace?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For we know him who said: '(The)
  vengeance is mine own, and I (prom) shall (lit. will) recompense.' And again:
  'The Lord will judge his people.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> A
  more fearful thing it is to fall into (the) hands of the living God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Remember your former days; in which
  ye were receiving (the) light, having endured in a great (amount) of pains;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> partly, in reproaches and
  tribulations being made a spectacle; partly, in that ye were sharers with
  them who fare thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For ye both
  suffered with them who were bound, and ye take joyfully (the) robbing of your
  possessions. Knowing that ye have [a] better riches and (such as) will stay
  for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Your boldness then throw it
  not away, this which hath a great recompense of reward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Ye have need of [a] patience, that, if ye should
  do (the) wish of God, ye may receive the promise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For yet again a very little while, he will come,
  who cometh, and he will not delay. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  But the righteous one will live from (the) faith. And if he should hide
  (away) my soul shall not be well pleased with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But we are not they of hiding (away) for a
  fleeing back unto [a] destruction, but for [a] faith unto [a] lifegiving of
  the soul.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But (the) faith is an assurance of
  (the things) which are hoped for, it is a proof of things which are not seen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For in this the elders were witnessed
  unto. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> In [a] faith we understand that
  the ages were prepared by (the) word of God, because from those which appear
  not was made that which is seen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In
  [a] faith Abel offered more (excellent) sacrifice to God than Kain, [this]
  through which it was witnessed unto him that he was righteous, God witnessing
  over his gifts: and through it, having died, he still speaketh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In [a] faith Enōch was removed, not to see (the)
  death; and he was not being found, because God removed him: for before the
  removal, it was witnessed unto him, that he pleased God: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but without faith it is not possible to please
  him: for it is right that he who cometh to God should believe that he is, and
  he will be rewarder of them who seek for him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> In [a] faith Nōe, having been shown concerning the
  things which were not yet seen, feared; he fashioned an ark unto a saving of
  his house, through which (ark) he condemned the world, and he became heir of
  the righteousness of (the) faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In
  [a] faith he who was called, namely Abraam, obeyed to come forth to the place
  which he was to receive as inheritance; and he came forth, not knowing
  whither he walked. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> In [a] faith he was
  sojourner in (the) land of the promise, as not his own, having dwelt in
  tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For they were looking out forward to
  the city which hath the foundations, whose craftsman and her maker is God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In [a] faith Sarra also herself, the
  barren woman, received [a] power unto (the) sending forth of [a] seed, and it
  was not (the) time of her age, since he who promised was to her trustworthy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore were born from one, and
  that deadened in body, according as the stars of (the) heaven in their
  abundance, and as the sand, which is by (the) lips of the sea, which is not
  numbered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> According to [a] faith all
  these died, they received not the promises, but they saw them afar off, and
  they saluted them, and they confessed that they were strangers and sojourners
  upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For they who say such
  things manifest that they seek for a city where they may dwell. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if indeed they were remembering that from
  which they came, then they had time to return to it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But now they desire that which is much better,
  which is that of (the) heaven: therefore God is not ashamed of them to be
  called God to them, for he prepared for them a city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> In [a] faith Abraam offered Isaac, being tempted:
  he offered his only son, even he who received the promises, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> he to whom it was said: In Isaac shall a seed be
  called for thee': <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and he reasoned
  that it was possible for God to raise him from them who are dead, therefore
  he took him (back) in a parable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In
  [a] faith concerning the (things) which will be, Isaac blessed Jacōb and
  Esau. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> In [a faith Jacōb about to die
  blessed each of (the) sons of Jōsēph; and he worshipped upon the top of his
  staff. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> In [a] faith Jōsēph about to
  die remembered (the) coming forth of (the) sons of Israel, and he ordered
  concerning his bones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> In [a] faith,
  Moses having been born, his parents hid him three months, because they saw
  the child that he was comely, and they feared not the decree of (the) king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> In [a] faith Moses, having grown up,
  refused to be called (the) son of (the) daughter of Pharaō; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> having wished rather to suffer with the people of
  God, than that he might surfeit in (the) sin for a time; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> having esteemed (the) reproach of Christ, that it
  was a greater wealth than the treasures of Chēmi: for he was looking out
  forward to the reward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> In [a] faith
  he left Chēmi, he feared not the wrath of (the) king: for he was waiting upon
  the unseen, as one seeing him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In [a]
  faith he kept the Pascha and the shedding of the blood, that the destroyer
  should not touch their firstborn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> In
  [a] faith they passed through the sea of Shari as (if) by [a] dry land: in
  which the men of Chēmi having made attempt were submerged. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> In [a] faith the walls of Jerichō fell, having
  been compassed seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> In [a]
  faith Raab the harlot perished not with them who were disobedient, having
  received the spies in [a] peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  what further should I say For the time shall fail me, narrating concerning
  Gedeōn, Barak, Sampsōm, Jephthaie, David and Samouēl and the prophets also:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> who through [a] faith conquered
  kingdoms, worked [the] righteousness, obtained [the] promises, stopped the
  mouths of lions, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> quenched (the) power
  of [a] fire, fled from the edge of swords. They prevailed in (the) weakness,
  they became strong in [the] war, they turned back armies of strangers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Women received their dead from a
  resurrection: others were tortured, they accepted not the redemption; that
  they might obtain the better resurrection: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> but others had trial in mockings and scourgings,
  but further, also bonds and prisons: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  they were stoned. They were sawn with (the) saw, they were tempted, they died
  by (the) killing of (the) sword, they walked in sheepskins, in goatskins,
  being in want, afflicted, suffering: <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  these of whom the world was not being worthy, wandering in the deserts, and
  the mountains, and the caves, and the holes of (the) earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And all these to whom it was witnessed through
  the faith received not the promise, <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span>
  God from (the) first having looked forward to a better thing because of us,
  that they might not be completed without us.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore indeed we also having
  cover us so great a cloud of witnesses, having left all pride and (the) sin
  which so much besets us, through [a] patience let us run in the race which is
  set down for us, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> looking at the author
  of (the) faith and the completer, Jesus, he who in exchange for the joy which
  was set before him, endured a cross, despised (the) shame, sat (down) at the
  right hand of the throne of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  reason in yourselves of this endurance of such an one at the hands of the
  sinners unto a contradiction against themselves, that ye may not be weary,
  fainting in your souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye have not
  yet stood (up) opposing (the) sin even unto (the) blood: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and ye forgot the exhortation [this] which spake
  to you as sons. My son, be not discouraged in the chastening of the Lord, nor
  faint (when) he is reproving thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For
  whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, but be scourgeth all sons whom he will
  receive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Be patient for chastening:
  God spake to you as sons; for what son (is it) whom his father chasteneth
  not? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If ye are without the chastening
  in which all shared, then ye are false sons, and ye (are) not sons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If indeed our fathers of (the) flesh
  we were having as chasteners, and we were reverencing them; then (is it) not
  more (right) that we should be subject to the Father of the spirits and live?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For those indeed for a few days were
  chastening us according to their will, but he indeed (according to) that
  which is the more profitable for us, that we might receive from his holiness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But all chastening at the time (lit.
  hour) indeed thou findest it (lit. them) not as things of [a] joy, but for
  [a] grief: but at (the) last it giveth a peaceful fruit of [the]
  righteousness to them who were exercised through it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore set up the hands which are let (down),
  and the legs which are paralysed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  make straight courses for your feet, that the lameness turn not aside, but
  rather that it may recover. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Run after
  [the] peace with every one, and [the] sanctification, that without which no
  one will see the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Looking
  earnestly lest by any means there is one falling short of the grace; lest by
  any means there is a bitter root growing up, giving pain, and through it many
  be polluted; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> lest by any means there
  is a fornicator or profane-hearted (one) as Esau, who sold his birthright for
  one meal (lit. food). <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Ye know that
  after it, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was cast out; for he found not
  place of repenting, although he had sought for it in tears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For ye came not to a fire of handling and (which)
  burneth, and (to) a gloom and a darkness (which) repelleth and a whirlwind,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and (the) blast of a trumpet and
  (the) voice of words, that which those who heard irttreatecl (him) not to
  speak to them again: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> for they were
  not being able to bear that which was being said. Even if a beast should
  touch the mountain they shall stone it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and thus was being terrible that which was
  manifested. For Moses said: 'I am afraid and I tremble': <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> but ye come to the mountain of Siōn, and the city
  of the living God, Jerusalem of (the) heaven, and myriads of angels keeping
  festival, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and a church of firstborn
  (which) is written in the heavens, and God the judge of all, and the spirit
  of the righteous ones who are completed, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and a
  blood of a sprinkling speaking more than that of Abel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Take heed, refuse not him who speaketh. For if
  those could not escape upon the earth, having refused him who speaketh, much
  more we, namely those who will turn away from him who came out of the
  heavens: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> whose voice moved the earth
  then; but now he promised, saying: 'Yet another time I (pron.) shall (lit.
  will) shake not only (the) earth but also the heaven.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But this (lit. the), Yet another time, is showing
  to us a carrying away of the things which are moved as things made, that the
  things which are not moved may be permanent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Therefore being about to receive a kingdom
  immovable, let us have grace, this through which we shall (lit. will)
  minister to God, pleasing him in [a] fear and [a] trembling: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> for also our God is a devouring fire.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_hebrews13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Let [the] brotherly love be
  permanent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Forget not [the]
  hospitality: for through this, unawares, some received angels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Remember those who are bound as being bound with
  them; those who are pained as being yourselves also in body. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The marriage (is) honourable in all, the bed pure:
  for the fornicators and the adulterers God will judge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Your manner of life is not for [a] loving of
  silver. The things which are (to you) shall suffice for you; for he himself
  said: I shall not forsake thee, nor shall I leave thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> So that being assured we (pron.) say: The Lord is
  my helper; I shall not fear what it is which man will do to me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember your rulers who spake to you the word of
  God: these (of) whom ye see the outcome of their walk (of life), imitate
  their faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Jesus Christ yesterday
  and to-day is the same and for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Let not various and strange doctrines carry you away: for it is good to
  establish your heart in [a] grace, not in meats, these in which they who
  walked in them found not profit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> We
  having an altar, this from which they have not authority to eat who minister
  at the tabernacle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the animals
  whose blood was brought into the holy (places) for (the) sin through the high
  priest,--(the) body of these is burnt outside the camp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore also Jesus, that he might cleanse the
  people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now then let us go out unto him outside the camp,
  bearing his reproach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For we have not
  here a permanent city, but that which cometh we seek for. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let us then offer through him sacrifices of
  blessing always to God, that is to say, (the) fruit of our lips, confessing
  his name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But [the] beneficence and
  the sharing (with others) forget not: for such sacrifices are pleasing to
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Be persuaded by your rulers, and
  obey them: for they (are those) who keep watch for your souls, as about to
  give account of you, that they may do this in [a] joy, and may not groan: for
  this is profitable for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Pray for
  us. But we are persuaded that we have a good conscience in all, wishing to
  walk well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But I pray the more to do
  this, that I may be restored to you quickly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But God of [the] peace--he who brought up from
  them who are dead the great shepherd of the sheep in (the) blood of the
  eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ- <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He shall perfect you in every good (thing) unto
  doing his wish, doing for him-(self) that which pleaseth him in us before
  him, through Jesus Christ; whose is the glory unto age of the ages. Amēn.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I beseech you, my brethren, bear with
  (the) word of the beseeching, for through a few (words) I wrote to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Ye know our brother Timotheos, he
  whom they released: with him (lit. this with him) should he come quickly I
  shall see you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Salute all your
  rulers, and all the saints. They of [the] Hytalia salute you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> (The) grace with you all. Amen.</p>
