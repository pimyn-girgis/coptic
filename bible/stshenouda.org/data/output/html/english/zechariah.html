  <h3 id="zechariah1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the
  eighth month, in the second year of the reign of Darius, the word of the Lord
  came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The Lord has been very angry
  with your fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt say
  to them, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn to me, saith the Lord of hosts,
  and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And be ye not as your fathers, whom the prophets
  before charged, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn ye from your evil
  ways, and from your evil practices: but they hearkened not, and attended not
  to hearken to me, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Where are your fathers, and the prophets? Will they live for ever?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But do ye receive my words and mine
  ordinances, all that I command by my Spirit to my servants the prophets, who
  lived in the days of your fathers; and they answered and said, As the Lord
  Almighty determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our
  practices, so has he done to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> On
  the twenty-fourth day in the eleventh month, this is the month Sabat, in the
  second year of the reign of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias,
  the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I saw by night, and behold a man mounted on a red
  horse, and he stood between the shady mountains; and behind him were red
  horses, and grey, and piebald, and white. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I said, What are these, my lord? And the angel
  spoke with me said to me, I will shew thee what these things are.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the man that stood between the
  mountains answered, and said to me, These are they whom the Lord has sent
  forth to go round the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they
  answered the angel of the Lord that stood between the mountains, and said, We
  have gone round all the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited, and
  is at rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then the angel of the
  Lord answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long wilt thou have no mercy on
  Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which thou has disregarded these seventy
  years? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord Almighty answered
  the angel that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry
  out and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem
  and Sion with great jealousy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I
  am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack her: forasmuch as I
  indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack her for evil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will
  return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house shall be rebuilt in her,
  saith the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet be stretched out over
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the angel that spoke
  with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet shall
  cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the Lord shall yet have mercy
  upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold
  four horns. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I said to the angel
  that spoke with me, What are these things, my lord? And he said to me, These
  are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord shewed me four
  artificers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I said, What are
  these coming to do? And he said, These are the horns that scattered Juda, and
  they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them lifted up his head: and these
  are come forth to sharpen them for their hands, even the four horns, the
  nations that lifted up the horn against the land of the Lord to scatter it.
  <h3 id="zechariah2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I lifted
  up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I said to him, Whither goest thou?
  And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it,
  and what is the length of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And,
  behold, the angel that spoke with me stood by, and another angel went forth
  to meet him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and spoke to him, saying,
  Run and speak to that young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be fully inhabited
  by reason of the abundance of men and cattle in the midst of her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I will be to her, saith the Lord,
  a wall of fire round about, and I will be for a glory in the midst of her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ho, ho, flee from the land of the
  north, saith the Lord: for I will gather you from the four winds of heaven,
  saith the Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> even to Sion: deliver
  yourselves, ye that dwell with the daughter of Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For thus saith the Lord Almighty; After the glory
  has he sent me to the nations that spoiled you: for he that touches you is as
  one that touches the apple of his eye. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  For, behold, I bring my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to them
  that serve them: and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of
  Sion: for, behold, I come, and will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And many nations shall flee for
  refuge to the Lord in that day, and they shall be for a people to him, and
  they shall dwell in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that the Lord
  Almighty has sent me to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the
  Lord shall inherit Juda his portion in the holy land, and he will yet choose
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let all flesh fear before
  the Lord: for he has risen up from his holy clouds.
  <h3 id="zechariah3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord
  shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and
  the Devil stood on his right hand to resist him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lords said to the Devil, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord rebuke thee, O Devil, even the Lord that
  has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: behold! is not this as a brand plucked from
  the fire? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Now Jesus was clothed in
  filthy raiment, and stood before the angel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord answered and spoke to those who stood
  before him, saying, Take away the filthy raiment from him: and he said to
  him, Behold, I have taken away thine iniquities: and clothe ye him with a
  long robe, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and place a pure mitre upon
  his head. So they placed a pure mitre upon his head, and clothed him with
  garments: and the angel of the Lord stood by. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the angel of the Lord testified to Jesus,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty;
  If thou wilt walk in my ways, and take heed to my charges, then shalt thou
  judge my house: and if thou wilt diligently keep my court, then will I give
  thee men to walk in the midst of these that stand here. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Hear now, Jesus the high priest, thou, and thy
  neighbours that are sitting before thee: for they are diviners, for, behold,
  I bring forth my servant The Branch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  For as for the stone which I have set before the face of Jesus, on the one
  stone are seven eyes: behold, I am digging a trench, saith the Lord Almighty,
  and I will search out all the iniquity of that land in one day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, ye shall
  call together every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.
  <h3 id="zechariah4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  angel that talked with me returned, and awakened me, as when a man is
  awakened out of his sleep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said
  to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and behold a candlestick all
  of gold, and its bowl upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels
  to the lamps upon it: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and two
  olive-trees above it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on the left.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I inquired, and spoke to the angel
  that talked with me, saying, What are these things, my lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the angel that talked with me answered, and
  spoke to me, saying, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No,
  my lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he answered and spoke to
  me, saying, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying, not by mighty
  power, nor by strength, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Who art thou, the great mountain
  before Zorobabel, that thou shouldest prosper? whereas I will bring out the
  stone of the inheritance, the grace of it the equal of my grace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The hands of Zorobabel have laid the
  foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and thou shalt know
  that the Lord Almighty has sent me to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For who has despised the small days? surely they
  shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet of tin in the hand of Zorobabel:
  these are the seven eyes that look upon all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I answered, and said to him, What are these
  two olive-trees, which are on the right and left hand of the candlestick?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I asked the second time, and said
  to him, What are the two branches of the olive-trees that are by the side of
  the two golden pipes that pour into and communicate with the golden oil
  funnels? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to me, Knowest
  thou not what these are? and I said, No, my lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he said, These are the two anointed ones that
  stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
  <h3 id="zechariah5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I
  turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked and behold a flying sickle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said to me, What seest thou?
  And I said, I see a flying sickle, of the length of twenty cubits, and of the
  breadth of ten cubits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he said to
  me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for
  every thief shall be punished with death on this side, and every false
  swearer shall be punished on that side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will bring it forth, saith the Lord
  Almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house
  of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall rest in the midst of his
  house, and shall consume it, and the timber of it, and the stones of it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the angel that talked with me went
  forth, and said to me, Lift up thine eyes, and see this that goes forth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I said, What is it? And he said,
  This is the measure that goes forth. And he said, This is their iniquity in
  all the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And behold a talent of
  lead lifted up: and behold a woman sat in the midst of the measure.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he said, This is iniquity. And he
  cast it into the midst of the measure, and cast the weight of lead on the
  mouth of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I lifted up mine
  eyes, and saw, and, behold, two women coming forth, and the wind was in their
  wings; and they had stork’s wings: and they lifted up the measure between the
  earth and the sky. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I said to the
  angel that spoke with me, Whither do these carry away the measure?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he said to me, To build it a
  house in the land of Babylon, and to prepare a place for it; and they shall
  set it there on its own base.
  <h3 id="zechariah6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I
  turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, four chariots
  coming out from between two mountains; and the mountains were brazen
  mountains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In the first chariot were
  red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the
  fourth chariot piebald and ash-coloured horses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I answered and said to the angel that talked
  with me, What are these, my Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  the angel that talked with me answered and said, These are the four winds of
  heaven, and they are going forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> As for the chariot in which were the
  black horses, they went out to the land of the north; and the white went out
  after them; and the piebald went out to the land of the south. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the ash-coloured went out, and looked to go
  and compass the earth: and he said, Go, and compass the earth. And they
  compassed the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he cried out
  and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these go out to the land of the north, and
  they have quieted mine anger in the land of the north. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Take the things of the captivity from
  the chief men, and from the useful men of it, and from them that have
  understood it; and thou shalt enter in that day into the house of Josias the
  son of Sophonias that came out of Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt take silver and gold, and make
  crowns, and thou shalt put them upon the head of Jesus the son of Josedec the
  high priest; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and thou shalt say to
  him, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Behold the man whose name is The Branch;
  and he shall spring up from his stem, and build the house of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall receive power, and shall
  sit and rule upon his throne; and there shall be a priest on his right hand,
  and a peaceable counsel shall be between them both. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the crown shall be to them that wait
  patiently, and to the useful men of the captivity, and to them that have
  known it, and for the favour of the son of Sophonias, and for a psalm in the
  house of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they that are
  far from them shall come and build in the house of the Lord, and ye shall
  know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you: and this shall come to pass,
  if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.
  <h3 id="zechariah7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came
  to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, that the word of the Lord came
  to Zacharias on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chaseleu.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Sarasar and Arbeseer the king and
  his men sent to Bethel, and that to propitiate the Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> speaking to the priests that were in the house of
  the Lord Almighty, and to the prophets, saying, The holy offering has come in
  hither in the fifth month, as it has done already many years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Speak to the whole people of
  the land, and to the priests, saying, Though ye fasted or lamented in the
  fifth or seventh months (yea, behold, these seventy years) have ye at all
  fasted to me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if ye eat or drink,
  do ye not eat and drink for yourselves? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by
  the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her
  cities round about her, and the hill country and the low country was
  inhabited? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the word of the Lord
  came to Zacharias, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thus saith
  the Lord Almighty; Judge righteous judgment, and deal mercifully and
  compassionately every one with his brother: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and oppress not the widow, or the fatherless, or
  the stranger, or the poor; and let not one of you remember in his heart the
  injury of his brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But they
  refused to attend, and madly turned their back, and made their ears heavy, so
  that they should not hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they
  made their heart disobedient, so as not to hearken to my law, and the words
  which the Lord Almighty sent forth by his Spirit by the former prophets: so
  there was great wrath from the Lord Almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it shall come to pass, that as he spoke, and
  they hearkened not, so they shall cry, and I will not hearken, saith the Lord
  Almighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will cast them out
  among all the nations, whom they know not; and the land behind them shall be
  made utterly destitute of any going through or returning: yea they have made
  the choice land a desolation.
  <h3 id="zechariah8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word
  of the Lord Almighty came, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Sion
  with great jealousy, and I have been jealous for her with great fury.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thus saith the Lord; I will return to
  Sion, and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
  true city, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty a holy mountain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty; There
  shall yet dwell old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, every one
  holding his staff in his hand for age. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing
  in the streets thereof. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord Almighty; If it shall be impossible in the sight of the remnant of this
  people in those days, shall it also be impossible in my sight? saith the Lord
  Almighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thus saith the Lord
  Almighty; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and the west
  country; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and I will bring them in, and
  cause them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be to me a
  people, and I will be to them a God, in truth and in righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Let your
  hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words out of the mouth of
  the prophets, from the day that the house of the Lord Almighty was founded,
  and from the time that the temple was built. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For before those days the wages of men could not
  be profitable, and there could be no hire of cattle, and there could be no
  peace by reason of the affliction to him that went out or to him that came
  in: for I would have let loose all men, every one against his neighbour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But now I will not do to the remnant
  of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But I will shew peace: the vine shall
  yield her fruit, and the land shall yield her produce, and the heaven shall
  give its dew: and I will give as an inheritance all these things to the
  remnant of my people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it shall
  come to pass, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Juda, and
  house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: be of good
  courage, and strengthen your hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  For thus saith the Lord Almighty; As I took counsel to afflict you when your
  fathers provoked me, saith the Lord Almighty, and I repented not:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> so have I prepared and taken counsel
  in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Juda: be ye of good
  courage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> These are the things which
  ye shall do; speak truth every one with his neighbour; judge truth and
  peaceable judgment in your gates: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and
  let none of you devise evil in his heart against his neighbour; and love not
  a false oath: for all these things I hate, saith the Lord Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the word of the Lord Almighty
  came to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast, and
  the tenth fast, shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness, and for
  good feasts; and ye shall rejoice; and love ye the truth and peace.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet
  shall many peoples come, and the inhabitants of many cities; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and the inhabitants of five cities shall come
  together to one city, saying, Let us go to make supplication to the Lord, and
  to seek the face of the Lord Almighty; I will go also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And many peoples and many nations shall come to
  seek earnestly the face of the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem, and to obtain
  favour of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord Almighty; In those days my word shall be fulfilled if ten men of all the
  languages of the nations should take hold—even take hold of the hem of a Jew,
  saying, We will go with thee; for we have heard that God is with you.
  <h3 id="zechariah9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The burden
  of the word of the Lord, in the land of Sedrach, and his sacrifice shall be
  in Damascus; for the Lord looks upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And in Emath, even in her coasts, are
  Tyre and Sidon, because they were very wise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Tyrus built strong-holds for herself, and
  heaped up silver as dust, and gathered gold as the mire of the ways.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And therefore the Lord will take them
  for a possession, and will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be
  consumed with fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Ascalon shall see,
  and fear; Gaza also, and shall be greatly pained, and Accaron; for she is
  ashamed at her trespass; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon
  shall not be inhabited. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And aliens
  shall dwell in Azotus, and I will bring down the pride of the Philistines.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will take their blood out of
  their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and these also
  shall be left to our God, and they shall be as a captain of a thousand in
  Juda, and Accaron as a Jebusite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I
  will set up a defence for my house, that they may not pass through, nor turn
  back, neither shall there any more come upon them one to drive them away: for
  now have I seen with mine eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; proclaim it aloud, O daughter of
  Jerusalem; behold, the King is coming to thee, just, and a Saviour; he is
  meek and riding on an ass, and a young foal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he shall destroy the chariots out of Ephraim,
  and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be utterly
  destroyed; and there shall be abundance and peace out of the nations; and he
  shall rule over the waters as far as the sea, and the rivers to the ends of
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou by the blood of
  thy covenant has sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit that has no water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ye shall dwell in strongholds, ye
  prisoners of the congregation: and for one day of thy captivity I will
  recompense thee double. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For I have
  bent thee, O Juda, for myself as a bow, I have filled Ephraim; and I will
  raise up thy children, O Sion, against the children of the Greeks, and I will
  handle thee as the sword of a warrior. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord shall be over them, and his arrow
  shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord Almighty shall blow with the
  trumpet; and shall proceed with the tumult of his threatening. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The Lord Almighty shall protect them, and they
  shall destroy them, and overwhelm them with sling-stones; and they shall
  swallow them down as wine, and fill the bowls as the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord their God shall save them in that
  day, even his people as a flock; for holy stones are rolled upon his land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For if he has anything good, and if
  he has anything fair, the young men shall have corn, and there shall be
  fragrant wine to the virgins.
  <h3 id="zechariah10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Ask ye of
  the Lord rain in season, the early and the latter: the Lord has given bright
  signs, and will give them abundant rain, to every one grass in the field.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For the speakers have uttered grievous
  things, and the diviners have seen false visions, and they have spoken false
  dreams, they have given vain comfort: therefore have they fallen away like
  sheep, and been afflicted, because there was no healing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and
  I will visit the lambs; and the Lord God Almighty shall visit his flock, the
  house of Juda, and he shall make them as his goodly horse in war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And from him he looked, and from him
  he set the battle in order, and from him came the bow in anger, and from him
  shall come forth every oppressor together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they shall be as warriors treading clay in the
  ways in war; and they shall set the battle in array, because the Lord is with
  them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and save
  the house of Joseph, and I will settle them; because I have loved them: and
  they shall be as if I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and
  I will hear them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they shall be as
  the warriors of Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as with wine: and
  their children also shall see it, and be glad; and their heart shall rejoice
  in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I will make a sign to
  them, and gather them in; for I will redeem them, and they shall be
  multiplied according to their number before. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will sow them among the people; and they
  that are afar off shall remember me: they shall nourish their children, and
  they shall return. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I will bring
  them again from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them in from among the
  Assyrians; and I will bring them into the land of Galaad and to Libanus; and
  there shall not even one of them be left behind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they shall pass through a narrow sea, they
  shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deep places of the rivers shall
  be dried up: and all the pride of the Assyrians shall be taken away, and the
  sceptre of Egypt shall be removed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God; and they shall boast in his
  name, saith the Lord.
  <h3 id="zechariah11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Open thy
  doors, O Libanus, and let the fire devour thy cedars. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let the pine howl, because the cedar has fallen;
  for the mighty men have been greatly afflicted: howl, ye oaks of the land of
  Basan; for the thickly planted forest has been torn down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> There is a voice of the shepherds mourning; for
  their greatness is brought low: a voice of roaring lions; for the pride of
  Jordan is brought down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord Almighty, Feed the sheep of the slaughter; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> which their possessors have slain, and have not
  repented: and they that sold them said, Blessed be the Lord; for we have
  become rich: and their shepherds have suffered no sorrow for them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore I will no longer have mercy
  upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: but, behold, I will deliver
  up the men every one into the hand of his neighbour, and into the hand of his
  king; and they shall destroy the land, and I will not rescue out of their
  hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will tend the flock of
  slaughter in the land of Chanaan: and I will take for myself two rods; the
  one I called Beauty, and the other I called Line; and I will tend the flock.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I will cut off three shepherds in
  one month; and my soul shall grieve over them, for their souls cried out
  against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I said, I will not
  tend you: that which dies, let it die; and that which falls off, let it fall
  off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of his neighbour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I will take my beautiful staff, and cast it
  away, that I may break my covenant which I made with all the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it shall be broken in that day;
  and the Chananites, the sheep that are kept for me, shall know that it is the
  word of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will say to
  them, If it be good in your eyes, give me my price, or refuse it. And they
  weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord said to me, Drop them into the
  furnace, and I will see if it is good metal, as I was proved for their sakes.
  And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the furnace in the
  house of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I cast away my
  second rod, even Line, that I might break the possession between Juda and
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord said to me, Take
  yet to thee shepherd’s implements belonging to an unskillful shepherd.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For, behold, I will raise up a
  shepherd against the land: he shall not visit that which is perishing, and he
  shall not seek that which is scattered, and he shall not heal that which is
  bruised, nor guide that which is whole: but he shall devour the flesh of the
  choice ones, and shall dislocate the joints of their necks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Alas for the vain shepherds that have forsaken
  the sheep! the sword shall be upon the arms of such a one, and upon his right
  eye: his arm shall be completely withered, and his right eye shall be utterly
  darkened.
  <h3 id="zechariah12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The burden
  of the word of the Lord for Israel; saith the Lord, that stretches out the
  sky, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Behold, I will make Jerusalem as
  trembling door-posts to all the nations round about, and in Judea there shall
  be a siege against Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it
  shall come to pass in that day that I will make Jerusalem a trodden stone to
  all the nations: every one that tramples on it shall utterly mock at it, and
  all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> In that day, saith the Lord Almighty,
  I will smite every horse with amazement, and his rider with madness: but I
  will open mine eyes upon the house of Juda, and I will smite all the horses
  of the nations with blindness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the
  captains of thousands of Juda shall say in their hearts, We shall find for
  ourselves the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the Lord Almighty their God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> In that day I will make the captains
  of thousands of Juda as a firebrand among wood, and as a torch of fire in
  stubble; and they shall devour on the right hand and on the left all the
  nations round about: and Jerusalem shall dwell again by herself, even in
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord shall save the
  tabernacles of Juda as at the beginning, that the boast of the house of
  David, and the pride of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not magnify
  themselves against Juda. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it shall
  come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall defend the inhabitants of
  Jerusalem; and the weak one among them in that day shall be as David, and the
  house of David as the house of God, as the angel of the Lord before them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,
  that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I will pour upon the house of
  David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and
  compassion: and they shall look upon me, because they have mocked me, and
  they shall make lamentation for him, as for a beloved friend, and they shall
  grieve intensely, as for a firstborn son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In that day the lamentation in Jerusalem shall be
  very great, as the mourning for the pomegranate grove cut down in the plain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the land shall lament in separate
  families, the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by
  themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by
  themselves; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> the family of the house
  of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Symeon by
  itself, and their wives by themselves; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> all the families that are left, each family by
  itself, and their wives by themselves.
  <h3 id="zechariah13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In that
  day every place shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants
  of Jerusalem for removal and for separation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
  Lord of hosts, that I will utterly destroy the names of the idols from off
  the land, and there shall be no longer any remembrance of them: and I will
  cut off the false prophets and the evil spirit from the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it shall come to pass, if a man will yet
  prophesy, that his father and his mother which gave birth to him shall say to
  him, Thou shalt not live; for thou has spoken lies in the name of the Lord:
  and his father and his mother who gave him birth shall bind him as he is
  prophesying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it shall come to pass
  in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when
  he prophesies; and they shall clothe themselves with a garment of hair,
  because they have lied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And one shall
  say, I am not a prophet, for I am a tiller of the ground, for a man brought
  me up thus from my youth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will
  say to him, What are these wounds between thine hands? and he shall say,
  Those with which I was wounded in my beloved house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Awake, O sword, against my shepherds, and against
  the man who is my citizen, saith the Lord Almighty: smite the shepherds, and
  draw out the sheep: and I will bring mine hand upon the little ones.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it shall come to pass, that in all
  the land, saith the Lord, two parts thereof shall be cut off and perish; but
  the third shall be left therein. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I
  will bring the third part through the fire, and I will try them as silver is
  tried, and I will prove them as gold is proved: they shall call upon my name,
  and I will hear them, and say, This is my people: and they shall say, The
  Lord is my God.
  <h3 id="zechariah14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Behold,
  the days of the Lord come, and thy spoils shall be divided in thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I will gather all the Gentiles to
  Jerusalem to war, and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and
  the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but
  the rest of my people shall not be utterly cut off from the city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord shall go forth, and fight
  with those Gentiles as when he fought in the day of war. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount
  of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives
  shall cleave asunder, half of it toward the east and the west, a very great
  division; and half the mountain shall lean to the north, and half of it to
  the south. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the valley of my
  mountains shall be closed up, and the valley of the mountains shall be joined
  on to Jasod, and shall be blocked up as it was blocked up in the days of the
  earthquake, in the days of Ozias king of Juda; and the Lord my God shall
  come, and all the saints with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  it shall come to pass in that day that there shall be no light, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and there shall be for one day cold and frost, and
  that day shall be known to the Lord, and it shall not be day nor night: but
  towards evening it shall be light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  in that day living water shall come forth out of Jerusalem; half of it toward
  the former sea, and half of it toward the latter sea: and so shall it be in
  summer and spring. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord shall
  be king over all the earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name
  one, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> compassing all the earth, and
  the wilderness from Gabe unto Remmon south of Jerusalem. And Rama shall
  remain in its place. From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first
  gate, to the gate of the corners, and to the tower of Anameel, as far as the
  king’s winepresses, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> they shall dwell
  in the city; and there shall be no more any curse, and Jerusalem shall dwell
  securely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And this shall be the
  overthrow with which the Lord will smite all the nations, as many as have
  fought against Jerusalem; their flesh shall consume away while they are
  standing upon their feet, and their eyes shall melt out of their holes, and
  their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there shall be in that day a great panic from
  the Lord upon them; and they shall lay hold every man of the hand of his
  neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped with the hand of his neighbour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Juda also shall fight in Jerusalem;
  and God shall gather the strength of all the nations round about, gold, and
  silver, and apparel, in great abundance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And this shall be the overthrow of the horses,
  and mules, and camels, and asses, and all the beasts that are in those camps,
  according to this overthrow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And it
  shall come to pass, that whosoever shall be left of all the nations that came
  against Jerusalem, shall even come up every year to worship the king, the
  Lord Almighty, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever of all
  the families of the earth shall not come up to Jerusalem to worship the king,
  the Lord Almighty, even these shall be added to the others. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, nor
  come; then upon them shall be the overthrow with which the Lord shall smite
  all the nations, whichever of them shall not come up to keep the feast of
  tabernacles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This shall be the sin of
  Egypt, and the sin of all the nations, whosoever shall not come up to keep
  the feast of tabernacles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In that day
  there shall be upon the bridle of every horse Holiness to the Lord Almighty;
  and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as bowls before the altar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And every pot in Jerusalem and in
  Juda shall be holy to the Lord Almighty: and all that sacrifice shall come
  and take of them, and shall seethe meat in them: and in that day there shall
  be no more the Chananite in the house of the Lord Almighty.
