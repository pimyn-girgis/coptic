  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The vision which Esaias the son of
  Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of
  Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear, O heaven, and hearken, O earth:
  for the Lord has spoken, saying, I have begotten and reared up children, but
  they have rebelled against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The ox
  knows his owner, and the ass his masterâ€™s crib: but Israel does not know me,
  and the people has not regarded me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ah
  sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: ye have
  forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Why should ye be smitten any more, transgressing
  more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> From the feet to the head, there is no
  soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer are healed:
  it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Your land is desolate, your cities burned with
  fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made
  desolate, overthrown by strange nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent
  in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a
  besieged city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if the Lord of
  Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should
  have been made like Gomorrha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Hear
  the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, thou
  people of Gomorrha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Of what value to
  me is the abundance of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am full of
  whole-burnt-offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the
  blood of bulls and goats: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> neither
  shall ye come with these to appear before me; for who has required these
  things at your hands? Ye shall no more tread my court. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Though ye bring fine flour, it is vain; incense
  is an abomination to me; I cannot bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and
  the great day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> your fasting, and rest
  from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: ye have become
  loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> When ye stretch forth your hands, I will turn
  away mine eyes from you: and though ye make many supplications, I will not
  hearken to you; for your hands are full of blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from
  your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> learn to do well; diligently seek judgment,
  deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice
  for the widow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And come, let us
  reason together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will
  make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make them
  white as wool. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if ye be willing,
  and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good of the land: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but if ye be not willing, nor hearken to me, a
  sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> How has the faithful city Sion, once
  full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now
  murderers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Your silver is worthless,
  thy wine merchants mix the wine with water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Thy princes are rebellious, companions of
  thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and
  not heeding the cause of widows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty men of
  Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against mine adversaries, and I will
  execute judgment on mine enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  I will bring my hand upon thee, and purge thee completely, and I will destroy
  the rebellious, and will take away from thee all transgressors. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I will establish thy judges as before, and
  thy counsellors as at the beginning: and afterward thou shalt be called the
  city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For her captives shall be saved with judgment,
  and with mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the transgressors
  and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord
  shall be utterly consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For they
  shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made
  ashamed of the gardens which they coveted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has
  cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And their strength shall be as a thread of tow,
  and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be
  burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench them.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The word which came to Esaias the
  son of Amos concerning Judea, and concerning Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For in the last days the mountain of the Lord
  shall be glorious, and the house of God shall be on the top of the mountains,
  and it shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come to it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And many nations shall go and say,
  Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the
  God of Jacob; and he will tell us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of
  Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he shall judge among the nations,
  and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into
  plow-shares, and their spears into sickles: and nation shall not take up
  sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now, O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk
  in the light of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For he has
  forsaken his people the house of Israel, because their land is filled as at
  the beginning with divinations, as the land of the Philistines, and many
  strange children were born to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  For their land is filled with silver and gold, and there was no number of
  their treasures; their land also is filled with horses, and there was no
  number of chariots. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the land is
  filled with abominations, even the works of their hands; and they have
  worshipped the works which their fingers made. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the mean man bowed down, and the great man was
  humbled: and I will not pardon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Now therefore enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth, for
  fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall
  arise to strike terribly the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  For the eyes of the Lord are high, but man is low; and the haughtiness of men
  shall be brought low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For the day of the Lord of hosts
  shall be upon every one that is proud and haughty, and upon every one that is
  high and towering, and they shall be brought down; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and upon every cedar of Libanus, of them that are
  high and towering, and upon every oak of Basan, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and upon every high mountain, and upon every high
  hill, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and upon every high tower, and
  upon every high wall, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and upon every
  ship of the sea, and upon every display of fine ships. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And every man shall be brought low, and the pride
  of men shall fall: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they shall hide all idols made
  with hands, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> having carried them into
  the caves, and into the clefts of the rocks, and into the caverns of the
  earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he
  shall arise to strike terribly the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For in that day a man shall cast forth his silver
  and gold abominations, which they made in order to worship vanities and bats;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> to enter into the caverns of the
  solid rock, and into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and by
  reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the
  earth.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Behold now, the Lord, the Lord of
  hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judea the mighty man and mighty
  woman, the strength of bread, and the strength of water, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> the great and mighty man, the warrior and the
  judge, and the prophet, and the counsellor, and the elder, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> the captain of fifty also, and the honourable
  counsellor, and the wise artificer, and the intelligent hearer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will make youths their princes, and mockers
  shall have dominion over them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the
  people shall fall, man upon man, and every man upon his neighbor: the child
  shall insult the elder man, and the base the honourable. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For a man shall lay hold of his brother, as one of
  his fatherâ€™s household, saying, Thou hast raiment, be thou our ruler, and let
  my meat be under thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he shall
  answer in that day, and say, I will not be thy ruler; for I have no bread in
  my house, nor raiment: I will not be the ruler of this people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judea has fallen, and
  their tongues have spoken with iniquity, disobedient as they are towards the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Wherefore now their glory has
  been brought low, and the shame of their countenance has withstood them, and
  they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, and made it manifest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil
  counsel against themselves, saying against themselves, Let us bind the just,
  for he is burdensome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruits of their
  works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Woe to the transgressor! evils
  shall happen to him according to the works of his hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> O my people, your exactors strip you, and
  extortioners rule over you: O my people, they that pronounce you blessed lead
  you astray, and pervert the path of your feet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But now the Lord will stand up for judgment, and
  will enter into judgment with his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The Lord himself shall enter into judgment with
  the elders of the people, and with their rulers: but why have ye set my
  vineyard on fire, and why is the spoil of the poor in your houses?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Why do ye wrong my people, and shame
  the face of the poor? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thus saith the
  Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with an
  outstretched neck, and with winking of the eyes, and motion of the feet, at
  the same time drawing their garments in trains, and at the same time sporting
  with their feet: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> therefore the Lord
  will humble the chief daughters of Sion, and the Lord will expose their form
  in that day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and the Lord will take
  away the glory of their raiment, the curls and the fringes, and the
  crescents, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and the chains, and the
  ornaments of their faces, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and the
  array of glorious ornaments, and the armlets, and the bracelets, and the
  wreathed work, and the finger-rings, and the ornaments for the right hand,
  (23) and the ear-rings, and the garments with scarlet borders, and the
  garments with purple grounds, and the shawls to be worn in the house, and the
  Spartan transparent dresses, and those made of fine linen, and the purple
  ones, and the scarlet ones, and the fine linen, interwoven with gold and
  purple, and the light coverings for couches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And there shall be instead of a sweet smell,
  dust; and instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope; and
  instead of a golden ornament for the head, thou shalt have baldness on
  account of thy works; and instead of a tunic with a scarlet ground, thou
  shalt gird thyself with sackcloth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And thy most beautiful son whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your
  mighty men shall fall by the sword, and shall be brought low. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the stores of your ornaments shall mourn, and
  thou shalt be left alone, and shalt be levelled with the ground.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And seven women shall take hold of
  one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own raiment: only
  let thy name be called upon us, and take away our reproach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And in that day God shall shine gloriously in
  counsel on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it shall be, that the remnant left
  in Sion, and the remnant left in Jerusalem, even all that are appointed to
  life in Jerusalem, shall be called holy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons
  and daughters of Sion, and shall purge out the blood from the midst of them,
  with the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he shall come, and it shall be with regard to
  every place of mount Sion, yea, all the region round about it shall a cloud
  overshadow by day, and there shall be as it were the smoke and light of fire
  burning by night: and upon all the glory shall be a defence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it shall be for a shadow from the heat, and as
  a shelter and a hiding place from inclemency of weather and from rain.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now I will sing to my beloved a
  song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and
  planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place
  for the wine-vat in it: and I waited for it to bring forth grapes, and it
  brought forth thorns. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And now, ye
  dwellers in Jerusalem, and every man of Juda, judge between me and my
  vineyard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> What shall I do any more to
  my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected it to bring forth
  grapes, but it has brought forth thorns. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now I will tell you what I will do to my
  vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will
  pull down its walls, and it shall be left to be trodden down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not
  be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I
  will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house
  of Israel, and the men of Juda his beloved plant: I expected it to bring
  forth judgment, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a
  cry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Woe to them that join house to
  house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their
  neighborâ€™s: will ye dwell alone upon the land? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For these things have reached the ears of the Lord
  of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall
  be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For where ten yoke of oxen plough the land shall
  yield one jar-full, and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Woe to them that rise up in the
  morning, and follow strong drink; who wait at it till evening: for the wine
  shall inflame them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For they drink
  wine with harp, and psaltery, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the
  works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore my people have been taken captive,
  because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead
  bodies, because of hunger and of thirst for water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened
  its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her
  pestilent men shall go down into it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced,
  and the lofty eyes shall be brought low. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in
  judgment, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls,
  and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Woe to them that draw sins to them as
  with a long rope, and iniquities as with a thong of the heiferâ€™s yoke:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> who say, Let him speedily hasten what
  he will do, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel
  come, that we may know it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Woe to
  them that call evil good, and good evil; who make darkness light, and light
  darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Woe to them that are wise in their own conceit,
  and knowing in their own sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Woe
  to the strong ones of you that drink wine, and the mighty ones that mingle
  strong drink: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> who justify the ungodly
  for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of
  fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff,
  and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord
  of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered
  against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and smote them:
  and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the
  midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but
  his hand is yet raised. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Therefore
  shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for
  them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> They shall not hunger nor be weary,
  neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles
  from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent;
  their horsesâ€™ hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a
  storm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> They rage as lions, and draw
  nigh as a lionâ€™s whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he
  shall cast them forth, and there shall be none to deliver them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he shall roar on account of them in that day,
  as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and,
  behold, there shall be thick darkness in their perplexity.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the year in
  which king Ozias died, that I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted
  throne, and the house was full of his glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And seraphs stood round about him: each one had
  six wings: and with two they covered their face, and with two they covered
  their feet, and with two they flew. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And one cried to the other, and they said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
  hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the lintel shook at the voice they uttered,
  and the house was filled with smoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And I said, Woe is me, for I am pricked to the heart; for being a man, and
  having unclean lips, I dwell in the midst of a people having unclean lips;
  and I have seen with mine eyes the King, the Lord of hosts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And there was sent to me one of the seraphs, and
  he had in his hand a coal, which he had taken off the altar with the tongs:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and he touched my mouth, and said,
  Behold, this has touched thy lips, and will take away thine iniquities, and
  will purge off thy sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I heard
  the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go to this
  people? And I said, behold, I am here, send me. And he said, Go, and say to
  this people, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Ye shall hear indeed, but
  ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the heart of this people has
  become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they
  closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
  understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I said, How long, O Lord? And he
  said, Until cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and
  the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left
  desolate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And after this God shall
  remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be
  multiplied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And yet there shall be a
  tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and
  as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the days of
  Achaz the son of Joatham, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, there came up Rasim
  king of Aram, and Phakee son of Romelias, king of Israel, against Jerusalem
  to war against it, but they could not take it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And a message was brought to the house of David,
  saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the
  soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet
  Achaz, thou, and thy son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of
  the fullerâ€™s field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt say
  to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let thy soul be
  disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce
  anger is over, I will heal again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  as for the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have
  devised an evil counsel, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> We
  will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them
  away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> thus saith the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall
  not abide, nor come to pass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the
  head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within
  sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from being a people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the head of Ephraim is Somoron,
  and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but if ye believe not, neither
  will ye at all understand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the
  Lord again spoke to Achaz, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Ask for thyself a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Achaz said, I will not ask,
  neither will I tempt the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he
  said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a little thing for you to contend
  with men? and how do ye contend against the Lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign;
  behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and
  thou shalt call his name Emmanuel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows either to prefer evil or
  choose the good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For before the child
  shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good; and the land
  shall be forsaken which thou art afraid of because of the two kings.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But God shall bring upon thee, and
  upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days which have never
  come, from the day that Ephraim took away from Juda the king of the
  Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And it shall come to pass
  in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the flies, which insect shall rule
  over a part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of
  the Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they all shall
  enter into the clefts of the land, and into the holes of the rocks, and into
  the caves, and into every ravine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In
  that day the Lord shall shave with the hired razor of the king of Assyria
  beyond the river the head, and the hairs of the feet, and will remove the
  beard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it shall come to pass in
  that day, that a man shall rear a heifer, and two sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it shall come to pass from their drinking an
  abundance of milk, that every one that is left on the land shall eat butter
  and honey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And it shall come to pass
  in that day, for every place where there shall be a thousand vines at a
  thousand shekels, they shall become barren land and thorns. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Men shall enter thither with arrow and bow; for
  all the land shall be barren ground and thorns. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And every mountain shall be certainly ploughed:
  there shall no fear come thither: for there shall be from among the barren
  ground and thorns that whereon cattle shall feed and oxen shall tread.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord said to me, Take to
  thyself a volume of a great new book, and write in it with a manâ€™s pen
  concerning the making a rapid plunder of spoils; for it is near at hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And make me witnesses of faithful men,
  Urias, and Zacharias the son of Barachias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I went in to the prophetess; and she
  conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me, Call his name, Spoil
  quickly, plunder speedily. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For before
  the child shall know how to call his father or his mother, one shall take the
  power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord spoke to me yet again,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Because this people chooses
  not the water of Siloam that goes softly, but wills to have Rassin, and the
  son of Romelias to be king over you; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon you the water of the river, strong
  and abundant, even the king of the Assyrians, and his glory: and he shall
  come up over every valley of yours, and shall walk over every wall of yours:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and he shall take away from Juda every
  man who shall be able to lift up his head, and every one able to accomplish
  anything; and his camp shall fill the breadth of thy land, O God with us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Know, ye Gentiles, and be conquered;
  hearken ye, even to the extremity of the earth: be conquered, after ye
  strengthened yourselves; for even if ye should again strengthen yourselves,
  ye shall again be conquered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall bring it to nought; and
  whatsoever word ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you: for God is with
  us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thus saith the Lord, With a
  strong hand they revolt from the course of the way of this people, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let them not say, It is hard, for
  whatsoever this people says, is hard: but fear not ye their fear, neither be
  dismayed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Sanctify ye the Lord
  himself; and he shall be thy fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And if thou shalt trust in him, he shall be to thee for a sanctuary; and ye
  shall not come against him as against a stumbling-stone, neither as against
  the falling of a rock: but the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and the
  dwellers in Jerusalem in a pit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Therefore many among them shall be weak, and fall, and be crushed; and they
  shall draw nigh, and men shall be taken securely. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then shall those who seal themselves that they
  may not learn the law be made manifest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And one shall say, I will wait for God, who has
  turned away his face from the house of Jacob, and I will trust in him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Behold I and the children which God
  has given me: and they shall be for signs and wonders in the house of Israel
  from the Lord of hosts, who dwells in mount Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if they should say to you, Seek those who
  have in them a divining spirit, and them that speak out of the earth, them
  that speak vain words, who speak out of their belly: shall not a nation
  diligently seek to their God? why do they seek to the dead concerning the
  living? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For he has given the law for
  a help, that they should not speak according to this word, concerning which
  there are no gifts to give for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And famine shall come sorely upon you, and it shall come to pass, that when
  ye shall be hungry, ye shall be grieved, and ye shall speak ill of the prince
  and your fathersâ€™ ordinances: and they shall look up to heaven above,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and they shall look on the earth
  below, and behold severe distress, and darkness, affliction, and anguish, and
  darkness so that one cannot see; and he that is in anguish shall not be
  distressed only for a time.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Drink this first. Act quickly, O
  land of Zabulon, land of Nephthalim, and the rest inhabiting the sea-coast,
  and the land beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> O people walking in darkness, behold a great
  light: ye that dwell in the region and shadow of death, a light shall shine
  upon you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The multitude of the people
  which thou hast brought down in thy joy, they shall even rejoice before thee
  as they that rejoice in harvest, and as they that divide the spoil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Because the yoke that was laid upon
  them has been taken away, and the rod that was on their neck: for he has
  broken the rod of the exactors, as in the day of Madiam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For they shall compensate for every garment that
  has been acquired by deceit, and all raiment with restitution; and they shall
  be willing, even if they were burnt with fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For a child is born to us, and a son is given to
  us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the
  Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and
  health to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> His government shall be
  great, and of his peace there is no end: it shall be upon the throne of
  David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to support it with judgment
  and with righteousness, from henceforth and forever. The seal of the Lord of
  hosts shall perform this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The Lord has
  sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt
  in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew
  stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a
  tower. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And God shall dash down them
  that rise up against him on mount Sion, and shall scatter his enemies;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> even Syria from the rising of the
  sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, who devour Israel with open
  mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but still his hand is
  exalted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the people turned not
  until they were smitten, and they sought not the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> So the Lord took away from Israel the head and
  tail, great and small, in one day: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  the old man, and them that respect persons, this is the head; and the prophet
  teaching unlawful things, he is the tail. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they that pronounce this people blessed shall
  mislead them; and they mislead them that they may devour them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore the Lord shall not take pleasure in
  their young men, neither shall he have pity on their orphans or on their
  widows: for they are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth speaks
  unjustly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is yet
  exalted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And iniquity shall burn as
  fire, and shall be devoured by fire as dry grass: and it shall burn in the
  thickets of the wood, and shall devour all that is round about the hills.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The whole earth is set on fire
  because of the fierce anger of the Lord, and the people shall be as men burnt
  by fire: no man shall pity his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But one shall turn aside to the right hand, for
  he shall be hungry; and shall eat on the left, and a man shall by no means be
  satisfied with eating the flesh of his own arm. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For Manasses shall eat the flesh of Ephraim, and
  Ephraim the flesh of Manasses; for they shall besiege Juda together. For all
  this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is yet exalted.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to them that write wickedness;
  for when they write they do write wickedness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> perverting the cause of the poor, violently
  wresting the judgment of the needy ones of my people, that the widow may be a
  prey to them, and the orphan a spoil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And what will they do in the day of visitation? for affliction shall come to
  you from afar: and to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave
  your glory, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that ye may not fall into
  captivity? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Woe to the Assyrians; the
  rod of my wrath, and anger are in their hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I will send my wrath against a sinful nation, and
  I will charge my people to take plunder and spoil, and to trample the cities,
  and to make them dust. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But he meant
  not thus, neither did he devise thus in his soul: but his mind shall change,
  and that to destroy nations not a few. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And if they should say to him, Thou alone art ruler; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then shall he say, Have I not taken the country
  above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and have I not taken
  Arabia, and Damascus, and Samaria? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> As
  I have taken them, I will also take all the kingdoms: howl, ye idols in
  Jerusalem, and in Samaria. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For as I
  did to Samaria and her idols, so will I do also to Jerusalem and her idols.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it shall come to pass, when the
  Lord shall have finished doing all things on Mount Sion and Jerusalem, that I
  will visit upon the proud heart, even upon the ruler of the Assyrians, and
  upon the boastful haughtiness of his eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For he said, I will act in strength, and in the
  wisdom of my understanding I will remove the boundaries of nations, and will
  spoil their strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I will
  shake the inhabited cities: and I will take with my hand all the world as a
  nest: and I will even take them as eggs that have been left; and there is
  none that shall escape me, or contradict me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Shall the axe glorify itself without him that
  hews with it? or shall the saw lift up itself without him that uses it, as if
  one should lift a rod or staff? but it shall not be so; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but the Lord of hosts shall send dishonour upon
  thine honour, and burning fire shall be kindled upon thy glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and
  he shall sanctify him with burning fire, and it shall devour the wood as
  grass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> In that day the mountains
  shall be consumed, and the hills, and the forests, and fire shall devour both
  soul and body: and he that flees shall be as one fleeing from burning flame.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they that are left of them shall
  be a small number, and a child shall write them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that the
  remnant of Israel shall no more join themselves with, and the saved of Jacob
  shall no more trust in, them that injured them; but they shall trust in the
  Holy God of Israel, in truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the
  remnant of Jacob shall trust on the mighty God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And though the people of Israel be as the sand of
  the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He will finish the work, and cut it short in
  righteousness: because the Lord will make a short work in all the world.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of
  hosts, Be not afraid, my people who dwell in Sion, of the Assyrians, because
  he shall smite thee with a rod: for I am bringing a stroke upon thee, that
  thou mayest see the way of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For
  yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease: but my wrath shall be
  against their council. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And God will
  stir up enemies against them, according to the stroke of Madiam in the place
  of affliction: and his wrath shall be by the way of the sea, even to the way
  that leads to Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it shall
  come to pass in that day, that his yoke shall be taken away from thy
  shoulder, and his fear from thee, and the yoke shall be destroyed from off
  your shoulders. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For he shall arrive
  at the city of Angai, and shall pass on to Maggedo, and shall lay up his
  stores in Machmas. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he shall pass
  by the valley, and shall arrive at Angai: fear shall seize upon Rama, the
  city of Saul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The daughter of Gallim
  shall flee; Laisa shall hear; one shall hear in Anathoth. <span style=

  Gibbir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Exhort ye them to-day to

  mightily confound the glorious ones; and the haughty in pride shall be

  world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Howl ye, for the day of the
  Lord is near, and destruction from God shall arrive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore every hand shall become powerless, and
  every soul of man shall be dismayed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  The elders shall be troubled, and pangs shall seize them, as of a woman in
  travail: and they shall mourn one to another, and shall be amazed, and shall
  change their countenance as a flame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  For behold! the day of the Lord is coming which cannot be escaped, a day of
  wrath and anger, to make the world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the stars of heaven, and
  Orion, and all the host of heaven, shall not give their light; and it shall
  be dark at sunrise, and the moon shall not give her light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I will command evils for the whole world, and
  will visit their sins on the ungodly: and I will destroy the pride of
  transgressors, and will bring low the pride of the haughty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they that are left shall be more precious
  than gold tried in the fire; and a man shall be more precious than the stone
  that is in Suphir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For the heaven
  shall be enraged, and the earth shall be shaken from her foundation, because
  of the fierce anger of the Lord of hosts, in the day in which his wrath shall
  come on. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they that are left shall
  be as a fleeing fawn, and as a stray sheep, and there shall be none to gather
  them: so that a man shall turn back to his people, and a man shall flee to
  his own land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For whosoever shall be
  taken shall be overcome; and they that are gathered together shall fall by
  the sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they shall dash their
  children before their eyes; and they shall spoil their houses, and shall take
  their wives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Behold, I will stir up
  against you the Medes, who do not regard silver, neither have they need of
  gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They shall break the bows of
  the young men; and they shall have no mercy on your children; nor shall their
  eyes spare thy children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Babylon,
  which is called glorious by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as when God
  overthrew Sodoma, and Gomorrha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> It
  shall never be inhabited, neither shall any enter into it for many
  generations: neither shall the Arabians pass through it; nor shall shepherds
  at all rest in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But wild beasts
  shall rest there; and the houses shall be filled with howling; and monsters
  shall rest there, and devils shall dance there, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and satyrs shall dwell there; and hedgehogs shall
  make their nests in their houses. It will come soon, and will not tarry.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord will have mercy on
  Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and they shall rest on their land: and the
  stranger shall be added to them, yea, shall be added to the house of Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Gentiles shall take them, and
  bring them into their place: and they shall inherit them, and they shall be
  multiplied upon the land for servants and handmaidens: and they that took
  them captives shall become captives to them; and they that had lordship over
  them shall be under their rule. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it
  shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy
  sorrow and vexation, and from thy hard servitude wherein thou didst serve
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt take up this
  lamentation against the king of Babylon, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The Lord has broken the yoke of sinners, the yoke
  of princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Having smitten a nation in
  wrath, with an incurable plague, smiting a nation with a wrathful plague,
  which spared them not, he rested in quiet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> All the earth cries aloud with joy: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> the trees also of Libanus rejoice against thee,
  and the cedar of Libanus, saying, From the time that thou hast been laid low,
  no one has come up to cut us down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Hell from beneath is provoked to meet thee: all the great ones that have
  ruled over the earth have risen up together against thee, they that have
  raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> All shall answer and say to thee, Thou also hast
  been taken, even as we; and thou art numbered amongst us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thy glory has come down to Hades, and thy great
  mirth: under thee they shall spread corruption, and the worm shall be thy
  covering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> How has Lucifer, that rose
  in the morning, fallen from heaven! He that sent orders to all the nations is
  crushed to the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But thou saidst
  in thine heart, I will go up to heaven, I will set my throne above the stars
  of heaven: I will sit on a lofty mount, on the lofty mountains toward the
  north: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I will go up above the clouds:
  I will be like the Most High. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But now
  thou shalt go down to hell, even to the foundations of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They that see thee shall wonder at
  thee, and say, This is the man that troubled the earth, that made kings to
  shake; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that made the whole world
  desolate, and destroyed its cities; he loosed not those who were in
  captivity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> All the kings of the
  nations lie in honour, every man in his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains, as
  a loathed carcase, with many dead who have been pierced with swords, going
  down to the grave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As a garment
  defiled with blood shall not be pure, so neither shalt thou be pure; because
  thou hast destroyed my land, and hast slain my people: thou shalt not endure
  for ever, â€”thou an evil seed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Prepare
  thy children to be slain for the sins of their father; that they arise not,
  and inherit the earth, nor fill the earth with wars. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord
  of hosts, and I will destroy their name, and remnant, and seed: thus saith
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will make the region
  of Babylon desert, so that hedgehogs shall dwell there, and it shall come to
  nothing: and I will make it a pit of clay for destruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, As I have said, so
  it shall be: and as I have purposed, so the matter shall remain: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> even to destroy the Assyrians upon my land, and
  upon my mountains: and they shall be for trampling; and their yoke shall be
  taken away from them, and their glory shall be taken away from their
  shoulders. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> This is the purpose which
  the Lord has purposed upon the whole earth: and this the hand that is
  uplifted against all the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For
  what the Holy God has purposed, who shall frustrate? and who shall turn back
  his uplifted hand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> In the year in
  which king Achaz died this word came. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Rejoice not, all ye Philistines, because the yoke of him that smote you is
  broken: for out of the seed of the serpent shall come forth the young asps,
  and their young shall come forth flying serpents, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the poor shall be fed by him, and poor men
  shall rest in peace: but he shall destroy thy seed with hunger, and shall
  destroy thy remnant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Howl, ye gates
  of cities; let the cities be troubled and cry, even all the Philistines: for
  smoke is coming from the north, and there is no possibility of living.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And what shall the kings of the
  nations answer? That the Lord has founded Sion, and by him the poor of the
  people shall be saved.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE WORD AGAINST THE LAND OF MOAB.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Grieve for yourselves; for even Debon,
  where your altar is, shall be destroyed: thither shall ye go up to weep, over
  Nabau of the land of Moab: howl ye: baldness shall be on every head, and all
  arms shall be wounded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Gird yourselves
  with sackcloth in her streets: and lament upon her roofs, and in her streets,
  and in her ways; howl all of you with weeping. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For Esebon and Eleale have cried: their voice was
  heard to Jassa: therefore the loins of the region of Moab cry aloud; her soul
  shall know. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The heart of the region of
  Moab cries within her to Segor; for it is as a heifer of three years old: and
  on the ascent of Luith they shall go up to thee weeping by the way of
  Aroniim: she cries, Destruction, and trembling. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The water of Nemerim shall be desolate, and the
  grass thereof shall fail: for there shall be no green grass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Shall Moab even thus be delivered? for I will
  bring the Arabians upon the valley, and they shall take it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the cry has reached the border of the region
  of Moab, even of Agalim; and her howling has gone as far as the well of Ã†lim.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the water of Dimon shall be filled
  with blood: for I will bring Arabians upon Dimon, and I will take away the
  seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will send as it were reptiles on
  the land: is not the mount of the daughter of Sion a desolate rock?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For thou shalt be as a young bird
  taken away from a bird that has flown: even thou shalt be so, daughter of
  Moab: and then do thou, O Arnon, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> take
  farther counsel, and continually make thou a shelter from grief: they flee in
  darkness at mid-day; they are amazed; be not thou led captive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The fugitives of Moab shall sojourn with thee;
  they shall be to you a shelter from the face of the pursuer: for thine
  alliance has been taken away, and the oppressing ruler has perished from off
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And a throne shall be
  established with mercy; and one shall sit upon it with truth in the
  tabernacle of David, judging, and earnestly seeking judgments, and hasting
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> We have heard of the
  pride of Moab; he is very proud. I have cut off his pride: thy prophecy shall
  not be thus, no not thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Moab shall
  howl; for all shall howl in the land of Moab: but thou shalt care for them
  that dwell in Seth, and thou shalt not be ashamed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The plains of Esebon shall mourn, the vine of
  Sebama: swallowing up the nations, trample ye her vines, even to Jazer: ye
  shall not come together; wander ye in the desert: they that were sent are
  deserted, for they have gone over to the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore will I weep as with the weeping of Jazer
  for the vine of Sebama; Esebon and Eleale have cast down thy trees; for I
  will trample on thy harvest and on thy vintages, and all thy plants shall
  fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And gladness and rejoicing
  shall be taken away from the vineyards; and they shall not at all tread wine
  into the vats; for the vintage has ceased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp for
  Moab, and thou hast repaired my inward parts as a wall. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it shall be to thy shame, (for Moab is
  wearied at the altars,) that he shall go in to the idols thereof to pray, but
  they shall not be at all able to deliver him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> This is the word which the Lord spoke against
  Moab, when he spoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And now I say,
  in three years, of the years of an hireling, the glory of Moab shall be
  dishonoured with all his great wealth; and he shall be left few in number,
  and not honoured.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE WORD AGAINST DAMASCUS. Behold,
  Damascus shall be taken away from among cities, and shall become a ruin;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> abandoned for ever, to be a fold and
  resting-place for flocks, and there shall be none to go after them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And she shall no longer be a strong
  place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in
  Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for thou art no better than the children
  of Israel, even than their glory; thus saith the Lord of hosts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> There shall be in that day a failure of the glory
  of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And it shall be as if one should gather standing
  corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather
  ears in a rich valley; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and as if there
  should be left stubble therein, or as it were the berries of an olive tree,
  two or three on the topmost bough, or as if four or five should be left on
  their branches; thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> In that day a man shall trust in him that made
  him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they shall not at all trust in their altars,
  nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not
  look to the trees, nor to their abominations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> In that day thy cities shall be deserted, as the
  Amorites and the Evaeans deserted theirs, because of the children of Israel;
  and they shall be desolate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because
  thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy
  helper; therefore shalt thou plant a false plant, and a false seed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In the day wherein thou shalt plant
  thou shalt be deceived; but if thou sow in the morning, the seed shall spring
  up for a crop in the day wherein thou shalt obtain an inheritance, and as a
  manâ€™s father, thou shalt obtain an inheritance for thy sons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Woe to the multitude of many nations, as the
  swelling sea, so shall ye be confounded; and the force of many nations shall
  sound like water; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> many nations like
  much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him
  away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the
  wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before
  the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled
  you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah18">18</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to you, ye wings of the land of
  ships, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  He sends messengers by the sea, and paper letters on the water: for swift
  messengers shall go to a lofty nation, and to a strange and harsh people. Who
  is beyond it? a nation not looked for, and trodden down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Now all the rivers of the land shall be inhabited
  as an inhabited country; their land shall be as when a signal is raised from
  a mountain; it shall be audible as the sound of a trumpet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be
  security in my city, as the light of noonday heat, and it shall be as a cloud
  of dew in the day of harvest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Before
  the reaping time, when the flower has been completely formed, and the unripe
  grape has put forth its flower and blossomed, then shall he take away the
  little clusters with pruning-hooks, and shall take away the small branches,
  and cut them off; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he shall leave
  them together to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth:
  and the fowls of the sky shall be gathered upon them, and all the beasts of
  the land shall come upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> In that
  time shall presents be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people afflicted
  and peeled, and from a people great from henceforth and for ever; a nation
  hoping and yet trodden down, which is in a part of a river of his land, to
  the place where is the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Sion.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE VISION OF EGYPT. Behold, the
  Lord sits on a swift cloud, and shall come to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt
  shall be moved at his presence, and their heart shall faint within them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Egyptians shall be stirred up
  against the Egyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, and a man
  against his neighbor, city against city, and law against law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled
  within them; and I will frustrate their counsel: and they shall enquire of
  their gods and their images, and them that speak out of the earth, and them
  that have in them a divining spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men, of cruel lords; and cruel
  kings shall rule over them: thus saith the Lord of hosts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is by
  the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the streams shall fail, and the canals of the
  river; and every reservoir of water shall be dried up, in every marsh also of
  reed and papyrus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And all the green
  herbage round about the river, and everything sown by the side of the river,
  shall be blasted with the wind and dried up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the fishermen shall groan, and all that cast a
  hook into the river shall groan; they also that cast nets, and the anglers
  shall mourn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And shame shall come upon
  them that work fine flax, and them that make fine linen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they that work at them shall be in pain, and
  all that make beer shall be grieved, and be pained in their souls.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the princes of Tanis shall be
  fools: as for the kingâ€™s wise counsellors, their counsel shall be turned into
  folly: how will ye say to the king, we are sons of wise men, sons of ancient
  kings? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Where are now thy wise men?
  and let them declare to thee, and say, What has the Lord of hosts purposed
  upon Egypt? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The princes of Tanis have
  failed, and the princes of Memphis are lifted up with pride, and they shall
  cause Egypt to wander by tribes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For
  the Lord has prepared for them a spirit of error, and they have caused Egypt
  to err in all their works, as one staggers who is drunken and vomits also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And there shall be no work to the
  Egyptians, which shall make head or tail, or beginning or end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But in that day the Egyptians shall be as women,
  in fear and in trembling because of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he
  shall bring upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the land
  of the Jews shall be for a terror to the Egyptians: whosoever shall name it
  to them, they shall fear, because of the counsel which the Lord of hosts has
  purposed concerning it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> In that day
  there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Chanaan, and
  swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the city
  of Asedec. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> In that day there shall be
  an altar to the Lord in the land of the Egyptians, and a pillar to the Lord
  by its border. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it shall be for a
  sign to the Lord for ever in the land of Egypt: for they shall presently cry
  to the Lord by reason of them that afflict them, and he shall send them a man
  who shall save them; he shall judge and save them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and
  the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; and they shall offer
  sacrifices, and shall vow vows to the Lord, and pay them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a
  stroke, and shall completely heal them: and they shall return to the Lord,
  and he shall hear them, and thoroughly heal them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to
  the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians
  shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> In that day shall Israel be third
  with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of
  hosts has blessed, <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> saying, Blessed be
  my people that is in Egypt, and that is among the Assyrians, and Israel mine

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the year when Tanathan came to
  Azotus, when he was sent by Arna king of the Assyrians, and warred against
  Azotus, and took it; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> then the Lord
  spoke to Esaias the son of Amos, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off thy
  loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet, and do thus, going naked and
  barefoot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord said, As my
  servant Esaias has walked naked and barefoot three years, there shall be
  three years for signs and wonders to the Egyptians and Ethiopians;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> for thus shall the king of the
  Assyrians lead the captivity of Egypt and the Ethiopians, young men and old,
  naked and barefoot, having the shame of Egypt exposed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Egyptians being defeated shall be ashamed
  of the Ethiopians, in whom they had trusted; for they were their glory.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they that dwell in this island
  shall say in that day, Behold, we trusted to flee to them for help, who could
  not save themselves from the king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be
  saved?</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE VISION OF THE DESERT. As though
  a whirlwind should pass through the desert, coming from a desert, even from
  such a land, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> so a fearful and a
  grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals
  treacherously, the transgressor transgresses. The Elamites are upon me, and
  the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort
  myself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore are my loins filled
  with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt
  wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me;
  my soul is occupied with fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Prepare
  the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare your shields.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For thus said the Lord to me, Go and
  station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a
  rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias

  and I stood in the camp all night: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said,
  Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been
  crushed to the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Hear, ye that
  are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord
  of hosts which the God of Israel has declared to us. THE VISION OF IDUMEA.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Call to me out of Seir; guard ye the
  bulwarks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I watch in the morning and
  the night: if thou wouldest enquire, enquire, and dwell by me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening,
  or in the way of Daedan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ye that
  dwell in the country of Thaeman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> meet the fugitives with bread,
  because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them
  that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of
  the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have
  fallen in war. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For thus said the Lord
  to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling, and the glory of the sons of
  Kedar shall fail: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and the remnant of
  the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of
  Israel has spoken it.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah22">22</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE WORD OF THE VALLEY OF SION.
  What has happened to thee, that now ye are all gone up to the housetops which
  help you not? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The city is filled with
  shouting men: thy slain are not slain with swords, nor are thy dead those who
  have died in battle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> All thy princes
  have fled, and thy captives are tightly bound, and the mighty men in thee
  have fled far away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Therefore I said,
  Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me for the breach
  of the daughter of my people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For it
  is a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and there is
  perplexity sent from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion;
  they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Elamites took their quivers, and there
  were men mounted on horses, and there was a gathering for battle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it shall be that thy choice
  valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up thy gates.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they shall uncover the gates of
  Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they shall uncover the secret
  places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were
  many, and that one had turned the water of the old pool into the city;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and that they had pulled down the
  houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And ye procured to yourselves water between the
  two walls within the ancient pool: but ye looked not to him that made it from
  the beginning, and regarded not him that created it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that
  day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with
  sackcloth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> but they engaged in joy
  and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and
  drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And these things are revealed in the ears of the
  Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until ye die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Go into
  the chamber, to Somnas the treasurer, and say to him, Why art thou here?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and what hast thou to do here, that
  thou hast here hewn thyself a sepulchre, and madest thyself a sepulchre on
  high, and hast graven for thyself a dwelling in the rock? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and
  will utterly destroy such a man, and will take away thy robe and thy glorious
  crown, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and will cast thee into a
  great and unmeasured land, and there thou shalt die: and he will bring thy
  fair chariot to shame, and the house of thy prince to be trodden down.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou shalt be removed from thy
  stewardship, and from thy place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the
  son of Chelcias: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and I will put on
  him thy robe, and I will grant him thy crown with power, and I will give thy
  stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in
  Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I will give him the glory of David; and he
  shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him
  the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and there
  shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will make him a ruler in a sure
  place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his fatherâ€™s house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And every one that is glorious in the
  house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and
  they shall depend upon him in that day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The man that is
  fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall
  fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord
  has spoken it.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> THE WORD CONCERNING TYRE. Howl, ye
  ships of Carthage; for she has perished, and men no longer arrive from the
  land of the Citians: she is led captive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> To whom are the dwellers in the island become
  like, the merchants of Phoenice, passing over the sea <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> in great waters, a generation of merchants? as
  when the harvest is gathered in, so are these traders with the nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Be ashamed, O Sidon: the sea has said,
  yea, the strength of the sea has said, I have not travailed, nor brought
  forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor reared virgins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Moreover when it shall be heard in Egypt, sorrow
  shall seize them for Tyre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Depart ye
  to Carthage; howl, ye that dwell in this island. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Was not this your pride from the beginning, before
  she was given up? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Who has devised this
  counsel against Tyre? Is she inferior? or has she no strength? her merchants
  were the glorious princes of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Lord of hosts has purposed to bring down all
  the pride of the glorious ones, and to disgrace every glorious thing on the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Till thy land; for ships no
  more come out of Carthage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thy
  hand prevails no more by sea, which troubled kings: the Lord of hosts has
  given a command concerning Chanaan, to destroy the strength thereof.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And men shall say, Ye shall no longer
  at all continue to insult and injure the daughter of Sidon: and if thou
  depart to the Citians, neither there shalt thou have rest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if thou depart to the land of the Chaldeans,
  this also is laid waste by the Assyrians, for her wall is fallen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Howl, ye ships of Carthage: for your
  strong hold is destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it
  shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be left seventy years, as the
  time of a king, as the time of a man: and it shall come to pass after seventy
  years, that Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Take a harp, go about, O city, thou harlot that
  hast been forgotten; play well on the harp, sing many songs, that thou mayest
  be remembered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it shall come to
  pass after the seventy years, that God will visit Tyre, and she shall be
  again restored to her primitive state, and she shall be a mart for all the
  kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And her trade and her gain shall be holiness to
  the Lord: it shall not be gathered for them, but for those that dwell before
  the Lord, even all her trade, to eat and drink and be filled, and for a
  covenant and a memorial before the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Behold, the Lord is about to lay
  waste the world, and will make it desolate, and will lay bare the surface of
  it, and scatter them that dwell therein. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the people shall be as the priest, and the
  servant as the lord, and the maid as the mistress; the buyer shall be as the
  seller, the lender as the borrower, and the debtor as his creditor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The earth shall be completely laid
  waste, and the earth shall be utterly spoiled: for the mouth of the Lord has
  spoken these things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The earth mourns,
  and the world is ruined, the lofty ones of the earth are mourning.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she has sinned by reason of her
  inhabitants; because they have transgressed the law, and changed the
  ordinances, even the everlasting covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore a curse shall consume the earth, because
  the inhabitants thereof have sinned: therefore the dwellers in the earth
  shall be poor, and few men shall be left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The wine shall mourn, the vine shall mourn, all
  the merry-hearted shall sigh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The
  mirth of timbrels has ceased, the sound of the harp has ceased. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They are ashamed, they have not drunk wine; strong
  drink has become bitter to them that drink it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> All the city has become desolate: one shall shut
  his house so that none shall enter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  There is a howling for the wine everywhere; all the mirth of the land has
  ceased, all the mirth of the land has departed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And cities shall be left desolate, and houses
  being left shall fall to ruin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> All
  this shall be in the land in the midst of the nations, as if one should strip
  an olive tree, so shall they strip them; but when the vintage is done,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> these shall cry aloud; and they that
  are left on the land shall rejoice together in the glory of the Lord: the
  water of the sea shall be troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Therefore shall the glory of the Lord be in the isles of the sea; the name of
  the Lord shall be glorious. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> O Lord
  God of Israel, from the ends of the earth we have heard wonderful things, and
  there is hope to the godly: but they shall say, Woe to the despisers, that
  despise the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Fear, and a pit, and
  a snare, are upon you that dwell on the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And it shall come to pass, that he that flees
  from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that comes up out of the pit
  shall be caught by the snare: for windows have been opened in heaven, and the
  foundations of the earth shall be shaken, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> the earth shall be utterly confounded, and the
  earth shall be completely perplexed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  It reels as a drunkard and one oppressed with wine, and the earth shall be
  shaken as a storehouse of fruits; for iniquity has prevailed upon it, and it
  shall fall, and shall not be able to rise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And God shall bring his hand upon the host of
  heaven, and upon the kings of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they shall gather the multitude thereof into
  prisons, and they shall shut them into a strong hold: after many generations
  they shall be visited. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the brick
  shall decay, and the wall shall fall; for the Lord shall reign from out of
  Sion, and out of Jerusalem, and shall be glorified before his elders.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah25">25</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord God, I will glorify thee, I
  will sing to thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, even an ancient
  and faithful counsel. So be it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For
  thou hast made cities a heap, even cities made strong that their foundations
  should not fall: the city of ungodly men shall not be built for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore shall the poor people bless
  thee, and cities of injured men shall bless thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For thou hast been a helper to every lowly city,
  and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: thou shalt
  deliver them from wicked men: thou hast been a shelter of them that thirst,
  and a refreshing air to injured men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  We were as faint-hearted men thirsting in Sion, by reason of ungodly men to
  whom thou didst deliver us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the
  Lord of hosts shall make a feast for all the nations: on this mount they
  shall drink gladness, they shall drink wine: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this
  mountain. Impart thou all these things to the nations; for this is Godâ€™s
  counsel upon all the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Death
  has prevailed and swallowed men up; but again the Lord God has taken away
  every tear from every face. He has taken away the reproach of his people from
  all the earth: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And in that day they shall say, behold our God in
  whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this is the Lord; we have waited
  for him, and we have exulted, and will rejoice in our salvation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> God will give rest on this mountain, and the
  country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with waggons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he shall spread forth his hands,
  even as he also brings down man to destroy him: and he shall bring low his
  pride in regard to the thing on which he has laid his hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he shall bring down the height of the refuge
  of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah26">26</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In that day they shall sing this
  song in the land of Judea; Behold a strong city; and he shall make salvation
  its wall and bulwark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Open ye the
  gates, let the nation enter that keeps righteousness, and keeps truth,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> supporting truth, and keeping peace:
  for on thee, O Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> they have trusted
  with confidence for ever, the great, the eternal God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> who hast humbled and brought down them that dwell
  on high, thou shalt cast down strong cities, and bring them to the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the feet of the meek and lowly
  shall trample them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The way of the
  godly is made straight: the way of the godly is also prepared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the way of the Lord is judgment: we have hoped
  in thy name, and on the remembrance of thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> which our soul longs for: my spirit seeks thee
  very early in the morning, O God, for thy commandments are a light on the
  earth: learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the ungodly one is put down: no one who will
  not learn righteousness on the earth, shall be able to do the truth: let the
  ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> O Lord, thine arm is exalted, yet they knew it
  not: but when they know they shall be ashamed: jealousy shall seize upon an
  untaught nation, and now fire shall devour the adversaries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> O Lord our God, give us peace: for thou hast
  rendered to us all things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> O Lord our
  God, take possession of us: O Lord, we know not any other beside thee: we
  name thy name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the dead shall not
  see life, neither shall physicians by any means raise them up: therefore thou
  hast brought wrath upon them, and slain them, and hast taken away every male
  of them. Bring more evils upon them, O Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> bring more evils on the glorious ones of the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Lord, in affliction I
  remembered thee; thy chastening was to us with small affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And as a woman in travail draws nigh to be
  delivered, and cries out in her pain; so have we been to thy beloved.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> We have conceived, O Lord, because of
  thy fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of thy
  salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all
  that dwell upon the land shall fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they
  that are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew from thee is healing to
  them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Go, my people, enter into thy closets, shut thy
  door, hide thyself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have
  passed away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For, behold, the Lord is
  bringing wrath from his holy place upon the dwellers on the earth: the earth
  also shall disclose her blood, and shall not cover her slain.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In that day God shall bring his
  holy and great and strong sword upon the dragon, even the serpent that flees,
  upon the dragon, the crooked serpent: he shall destroy the dragon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In that day there shall be a fair
  vineyard, and a desire to commence a song concerning it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I am a strong city, a city in a siege: in vain
  shall I water it; for it shall be taken by night, and by day the wall shall
  fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> There is no woman that has not
  taken hold of it; who will set me to watch stubble in the field? because of
  this enemy I have set her aside; therefore on this account the Lord has done
  all that he appointed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I am burnt up;
  they that dwell in her shall cry, Let us make peace with him, let us make
  peace, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> they that are coming are the
  children of Jacob. Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be
  filled with his fruit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Shall he
  himself be thus smitten, even as he smote? and as he slew, shall he be thus
  slain? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Fighting and reproaching he
  will dismiss them; didst thou not meditate with a harsh spirit, to slay them
  with a wrathful spirit? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore
  shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I
  shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the
  stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and
  their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The flock that dwelt there shall be left, as a
  deserted flock; and the ground shall be for a long time for pasture, and
  there shall flocks lie down to rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of the grass
  being parched. Come hither, ye women that come from a sight; for it is a
  people of no understanding; therefore he that made them shall have no pity
  upon them, and he that formed them shall have no mercy upon them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day
  that God shall fence men off from the channel of the river as far as
  Rhinocorura; but do ye gather one by one the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that they
  shall blow the great trumpet, and the lost ones in the land of the Assyrians
  shall come, and the lost ones in Egypt, and shall worship the Lord on the
  holy mountain in Jerusalem.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to the crown of pride, the
  hirelings of Ephraim, the flower that has fallen from the glory of the top of
  the fertile mountain, they that are drunken without wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Behold, the anger of the Lord is strong and
  severe, as descending hail where there is no shelter, violently descending;
  as a great body of water sweeping away the soil, he shall make rest for the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The crown of pride, the
  hirelings of Ephraim, shall be beaten down with the hands and with the feet.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the fading flower of the glorious
  hope on the top of the high mountain shall be as the early fig; he that sees
  it, before he takes it into his hand, will desire to swallow it down.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In that day the Lord of hosts shall be
  the crown of hope, the woven crown of glory, to the remnant of the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They shall be left in the spirit of
  judgment for judgment, and for the strength of them that hinder slaying.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For these have trespassed through
  wine; they have erred through strong drink: the priest and the prophet are
  mad through strong drink, they are swallowed up by reason of wine, they have
  staggered through drunkenness; they have erred: this is their vision.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> A curse shall devour this counsel, for
  this is their counsel for the sake of covetousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> To whom have we reported evils? and to whom have
  we reported a message? even to those that are weaned from the milk, who are
  drawn from the breast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Expect thou
  affliction on affliction, hope upon hope: yet a little, and yet a little,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> by reason of the contemptuous words
  of the lips, by means of another language: for they shall speak to this
  people, saying to them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> This is the
  rest to him that is hungry, and this is the calamity: but they would not
  hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore the oracle of God
  shall be to them affliction on affliction, hope on hope, yet a little, and
  yet a little, that they may go and fall backward; and they shall be crushed
  and shall be in danger, and shall be taken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, ye
  afflicted men, and ye princes of this people that is in Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because ye have said, We have made a
  covenant with Hades, and agreements with death; if the rushing storm should
  pass, it shall not come upon us: we have made falsehood our hope, and by
  falsehood shall we be protected: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Therefore thus saith the Lord, even the Lord, Behold, I lay for the
  foundations of Sion a costly stone, a choice, a corner-stone, a precious
  stone, for its foundations; and he that believes on him shall by no means be
  ashamed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will cause judgment to
  be for hope, and my compassion shall be for just measures, and ye that trust
  vainly in falsehood shall fall: for the storm shall by no means pass by you,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> except it also take away your
  covenant of death, and your trust in Hades shall by no means stand: if the
  rushing storm should come upon you, ye shall be beaten down by it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Whenever it shall pass by, it shall
  take you; morning by morning it shall pass by in the day, and in the night
  there shall be an evil hope. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> ye that
  are distressed; we cannot fight, but we are ourselves too weak for you to be
  gathered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The Lord shall rise up as a
  mountain of ungodly men, and shall be in the valley of Gabaon; he shall
  perform his works with wrath, even a work of bitterness, and his wrath shall
  deal strangely, and his destruction shall be strange. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore do not ye rejoice, neither let your
  bands be made strong; for I have heard of works finished and cut short by the
  Lord of hosts, which he will execute upon all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Hearken, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my
  words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Will the ploughman plough all
  the day? or will he prepare the seed beforehand, before he tills the ground?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Does he not, when he has levelled the
  surface thereof, then sow the small black poppy, or cumin, and afterward sow
  wheat, and barley, and millet, and bread-corn in thy borders? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> So thou shalt be chastened by the judgment of thy
  God, and shalt rejoice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For the black
  poppy is not cleansed with harsh treatment, nor will a wagon-wheel pass over
  the cumin; but the black poppy is threshed with a rod, and the cumin shall be
  eaten with bread; <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> for I will not be
  wroth with you for ever, neither shall the voice of my anger crush you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And these signs came forth from the
  Lord of hosts. Take counsel, exalt vain comfort.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah29">29</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Alas for the city of Ariel, which
  David besieged. Gather ye fruits year by year; eat ye, for ye shall eat with
  Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For I will grievously afflict
  Ariel: and her strength and her wealth shall be mine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I will compass thee about like David, and will
  raise a mound about thee, and set up towers round thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thy words shall be brought down to the earth,
  and thy words shall sink down to the earth, and thy voice shall be as they
  that speak out of the earth, and thy voice shall be lowered to the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the wealth of the ungodly shall be
  as dust from a wheel, and the multitude of them that oppress thee as flying
  chaff, and it shall be suddenly as a moment, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> from the Lord of Hosts: for there shall be a
  visitation with thunder, and earthquake, and a loud noise, a rushing tempest,
  and devouring flame of fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  wealth of all the nations together, as many as have fought against Ariel, and
  all they that war against Jerusalem, and all who are gathered against her,
  and they that distress her, shall be as one that dreams in sleep by night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And as men drink and eat in sleep, and
  when they have arisen, the dream is vain: and as a thirsty man dreams as if
  he drank, and having arisen is still thirsty, and his soul has desired in
  vain: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, as many as have fought
  against the mount Sion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Faint ye, and
  be amazed, and be overpowered, not with strong drink nor with wine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the Lord has made you to drink a
  spirit of deep sleep; and he shall close their eyes, and the eyes of their
  prophets and of their rulers, who see secret things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all these things shall be to you as the words
  of this sealed book, which if they shall give to a learned man, saying, Read
  this, he shall then say, I cannot read it, for it is sealed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And this book shall be given into the hands of a
  man that is unlearned, and one shall say to him, Read this; and he shall say,
  I am not learned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord has
  said, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and they honour me with
  their lips, but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they worship me,
  teaching the commandments and doctrines of men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore behold I will proceed to remove this
  people, and I will remove them: and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
  and will hide the understanding of the prudent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Woe to them that deepen their counsel, and not by
  the Lord. Woe to them that take secret counsel, and whose works are in
  darkness, and they say, Who has seen us? and who shall know us, or what we
  do? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Shall ye not be counted as clay
  of the potter? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Thou didst
  not form me? or the work to the maker, Thou hast not made me wisely?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Is it not yet a little while, and
  Libanus shall be changed as the mountains of Chermel, and Chermel shall be
  reckoned as a forest? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And in that day
  the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they that are in darkness, and
  they that are in mist: the eyes of the blind shall see, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and the poor shall rejoice with joy because of
  the Lord, and they that had no hope among men shall be filled with joy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The lawless man has come to nought,
  and the proud man has perished, and they that transgress mischievously have
  been utterly destroyed: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and they that
  cause men to sin by a word: and men shall make all that reprove in the gates
  an offence, because they have unjustly turned aside the righteous.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord
  concerning the house of Jacob, whom he set apart from Abraam, Jacob shall not
  now be ashamed, neither shall he now change countenance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But when their children shall have seen my works,
  they shall sanctify my name for my sake, and they sanctify the Holy One of
  Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they that erred in spirit shall know
  understanding, and the murmurers shall learn obedience, and the stammering
  tongues shall learn to speak peace.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah30">30</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to the apostate children, saith
  the Lord: ye have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit,
  to add sins to sins: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> even they that
  proceed to go down into Egypt, but they have not enquired of me, that they
  might be helped by Pharao, and protected by the Egyptians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the protection of Pharaoh shall be to you a
  disgrace, and there shall be a reproach to them that trust in Egypt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For there are princes in Tanes, evil
  messengers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In vain shall they labour
  in seeking to a people, which shall not profit them for help, but shall be
  for a shame and reproach. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> THE VISION
  OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE DESERT. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The
  Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is
  vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now then sit down and write
  these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for many
  long days, and even for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For the
  people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> who say to the prophets, Report not
  to us; and to them that see visions, Speak them not to us, but speak and
  report to us another error; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and turn
  us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the
  oracle of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore thus
  saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words,
  and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been
  confident in this respect: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> therefore
  shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has
  been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of
  an earthen vessel, as small fragments of a pitcher, so that thou shouldest
  not find among them a sherd, with which thou mightest take up fire, and with
  which thou shouldest draw a little water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel;
  When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know
  where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities: then your strength became
  vain, yet ye would not hearken: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but
  ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be
  aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> A thousand shall flee because of the
  voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye
  be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a
  hill. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the Lord will again wait,
  that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy
  upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay
  themselves upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For the holy
  people shall dwell in Sion: and whereas Jerusalem has wept bitterly, saying,
  Pity me; he shall pity thee: when he perceived the voice of thy cry, he
  hearkened to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And though the
  Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that
  cause thee to err shall no more at all draw nigh to thee; for thine eyes
  shall see those that cause thee to err, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and thine ears shall hear the words of them that
  went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This is the way, let us walk in
  it, whether to the right or to the left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou
  shalt grind to powder the gilt ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a
  removed woman, and thou shalt thrust them forth as dung. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land;
  and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy
  cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground,
  shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and
  upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and
  when the towers shall fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the
  light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun
  shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his
  people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a long
  time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of
  anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And his breath, as rushing water in a valley,
  shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for
  their vain error: error also shall pursue them, and overtake them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Must ye always rejoice, and go into
  my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a
  pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of
  Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the Lord shall make his
  glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with
  wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and his wrath
  shall be as water and violent hail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, even by the
  stroke wherewith he shall smite them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  And it shall happen to him from every side, that they from whom their hope of
  assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn
  with drums and with harp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> For thou
  shalt be required before thy time: has it been prepared for thee also to
  reign? nay, God has prepared for thee a deep trench, wood piled, fire and
  much wood: the wrath of the Lord shall be as a trench kindled with
  sulphur.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah31">31</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to them that go down to Egypt
  for help, who trust in horses and chariots, for they are many; and in horses,
  which are a great multitude; and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel,
  and have not sought the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Therefore he has wisely brought evils upon them, and his word shall not be
  frustrated; and he shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and
  against their vain hope, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> even an
  Egyptian, a man, and not God; the flesh of horses, and there is no help in
  them: but the Lord shall bring his hand upon them, and the helpers shall
  fail, and all shall perish together. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lionâ€™s whelp over
  prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with
  his voice, and the animals are awe-struck and tremble at the fierceness of
  his wrath: so the Lord of hosts shall descend to fight upon the mount Sion,
  even upon her mountains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> As birds
  flying, so shall the Lord of hosts defend; he shall defend Jerusalem, and he
  shall rescue, and save and deliver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Turn, ye children of Israel, who devise a deep and sinful counsel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For in that day men shall renounce
  their silver idols and their golden idols, which their hands made.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Assyrian shall fall: not the
  sword of a great man, nor the sword of a mean man shall devour him; neither
  shall he flee from the face of the sword: but the young men shall be
  overthrown: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> for they shall be
  compassed with rocks as with a trench, and shall be worsted; and he that
  flees shall be taken. Thus saith the Lord, Blesses is he that has a seed in
  Sion, and household friends in Jerusalem.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah32">32</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For, behold, a righteous king shall
  reign, and princes shall govern with judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And a man shall hide his words, and be hidden, as
  from rushing water, and shall appear in Sion as a rushing river, glorious in
  a thirsty land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they shall no more
  trust in men, but they shall incline their ears to hear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the heart of the weak ones shall attend to
  hear, and the stammering tongues shall soon learn to speak peace.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they shall no more at all tell a
  fool to rule, and thy servants shall no more at all say, Be silent.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For the fool shall speak foolish
  words, and his heart shall meditate vanities, and to perform lawless deeds
  and to speak error against the Lord, to scatter hungry souls, and he will
  cause the thirsty souls to be empty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  For the counsel of the wicked will devise iniquity, to destroy the poor with
  unjust words, and ruin the cause of the poor in judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the godly have devised wise measures, and this
  counsel shall stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Rise up, ye rich
  women, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, hearken to my words.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Remember for a full year in pain, yet
  with hope: the vintage has been cut off; it has ceased, it shall by no means
  come again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Be amazed, be pained, ye
  confident ones: strip you, bare yourselves, gird your loins; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and beat your breasts, because of the pleasant
  field, and the fruit of the vine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> As
  for the land of my people, the thorn and grass shall come upon it, and joy
  shall be removed from every house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> As
  for the rich city, the houses are deserted; they shall abandon the wealth of
  the city, and the pleasant houses: and the villages shall be caves for ever,
  the joy of wild asses, shepherdsâ€™ pastures; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> until the Spirit shall come upon you from on
  high, and Chermel shall be desert, and Chermel shall be counted for a forest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then judgment shall abide in the
  wilderness, and righteousness shall dwell in Carmel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the works of righteousness shall be peace;
  and righteousness shall ensure rest, and the righteous shall be confident for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And his people shall inhabit a
  city of peace, and dwell in it in confidence, and they shall rest with
  wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if the hail should come
  down, it shall not come upon you; and they that dwell in the forests shall be
  in confidence, as those in the plain country. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Blessed are they that sow by every water, where
  the ox and ass tread.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah33">33</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Woe to them that afflict you; but
  no one makes you miserable: and he that deals perfidiously with you does not
  deal perfidiously: they that deal perfidiously shall be taken and given up,
  and as a moth on a garment, so shall they be spoiled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Lord, have mercy upon us; for we have trusted in
  thee: the seed of the rebellious is gone to destruction, but our deliverance
  was in a time of affliction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> By reason
  of the terrible sound the nations were dismayed for fear of thee, and the
  heathen were scattered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And now shall
  the spoils of your small and great be gathered: as if one should gather
  locusts, so shall they mock you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The
  God who dwells on high is holy: Sion is filled with judgment and
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They shall be delivered
  up to the law: our salvation is our treasure: there are wisdom and knowledge
  and piety toward the Lord; these are the treasures of righteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold now, these shall be terrified
  with fear of you: those whom ye feared shall cry out because of you:
  messengers shall be sent, bitterly weeping, entreating for peace.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the ways of these shall be made
  desolate: the terror of the nations has been made to cease, and the covenant
  with these is taken away, and ye shall by no means deem them men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The land mourns; Libanus is ashamed:
  Saron is become marshes; Galilee shall be laid bare, and Chermel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now will I arise, saith the Lord, now
  will I be glorified; now will I be exalted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Now shall ye see, now shall ye perceive; the
  strength of your breath, shall be vain; fire shall devour you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the nations shall be burnt up; as a thorn in
  the field cast out and burnt up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They
  that are afar off shall hear what I have done; they that draw nigh shall know
  my strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The sinners in Sion have
  departed; trembling shall seize the ungodly. Who will tell you that a fire is
  kindled? Who will tell you of the eternal place? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He that walks in righteousness, speaking rightly,
  hating transgression and iniquity, and shaking his hands from gifts, stopping
  his ears that he should not hear the judgment of blood, shutting his eyes
  that he should not see injustice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> he
  shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock: bread shall be given him, and
  his water shall be sure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Ye shall see
  a king with glory: your eyes shall behold a land from afar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Your soul shall meditate terror. Where are the
  scribes? where are the counsellors, where is he that numbers them that are
  growing up, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> even the small and great
  people? with whom he took not counsel, neither did he understand a people of
  deep speech, so that a despised people should not hear, and there is no
  understanding to him that hears. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Behold the city of Sion, our refuge: thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, a
  rich city, tabernacles which shall not be shaken, neither shall the pins of
  her tabernacle be moved for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for the name of the Lord is great to
  you: ye shall have a place, even rivers and wide and spacious channels: thou
  shalt not go this way, neither a vessel with oars go thereby. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For my God is great: the Lord our judge shall not
  pass me by: the Lord is our prince, the Lord is our king; the Lord, he shall
  save us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Thy cords are broken, for
  they had no strength: thy meat has given way, it shall not spread the sails,
  it shall not bear a signal, until it be given up for plunder; therefore shall
  many lame men take spoil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the
  people dwelling among them shall by no means say, I am in pain: for their sin
  shall be forgiven them.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah34">34</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Draw near, ye nations; and hearken,
  ye princes; let the earth hear, and they that are in it; the world, and the
  people that are therein. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For the wrath
  of the Lord is upon all nations, and his anger upon the number of them, to
  destroy them, and give them up to slaughter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And their slain shall be cast forth, and their
  corpses; and their ill savour shall come up, and the mountains shall be made
  wet with their blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And all the
  powers of the heavens shall melt, and the sky shall be rolled up like a
  scroll: and all the stars shall fall like leaves from a vine, and as leaves
  fall from a fig-tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> My sword has
  been made drunk in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and with
  judgment upon the people doomed to destruction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is
  glutted with fat, with the blood of goats and lambs, and with the fat of
  goats and rams: for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bosor, and a great slaughter
  in Idumea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the mighty ones shall
  fall with them, and the rams and the bulls; and the land shall be soaked with
  blood, and shall be filled with their fat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For it is the day of judgment of the Lord, and the
  year of the recompence of Sion in judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and
  her land into sulphur; and her land shall be as pitch burning night and day;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and it shall never be quenched, and
  her smoke shall go up: it shall be made desolate throughout her generations,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and for a long time birds and
  hedgehogs, and ibises and ravens shall dwell in it: and the measuring line of
  desolation shall be cast over it, and satyrs shall dwell in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Her princes shall be no more; for her kings and
  her great men shall be destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  thorns shall spring up in their cities, and in her strong holds: and they
  shall be habitations of monsters, and a court of ostriches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And devils shall meet with satyrs, and they shall
  cry one to the other: there shall satyrs rest, having found for themselves a
  place of rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> There has the hedgehog
  made its nest, and the earth has safely preserved its young: there have the
  deer met, and seen one anotherâ€™s faces. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They passed by in full number, and not one of
  them perished: they sought not one another; for the Lord commanded them, and
  his Spirit gathered them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he
  shall cast lots for them, and his hand has portioned out their pasture,
  saying, Ye shall inherit the land for ever: they shall rest on it through all
  generations.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah35">35</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Be glad, thou thirsty desert: let

  rejoice; the glory of Libanus has been given to it, and the honour of Carmel;
  and my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Be strong, ye relaxed hands and
  palsied knees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Comfort one another, ye
  fainthearted; be strong, fear not; behold, our God renders judgment, and he
  will render it; he will come and save us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and
  the ears of the deaf shall hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then
  shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall
  speak plainly; for water has burst forth in the desert, and a channel of
  water in a thirsty land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the dry
  land shall become pools, and a fountain of water shall be poured into the
  thirsty land; there shall there be a joy of birds, ready habitations and
  marshes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> There shall be there a pure
  way, and it shall be called a holy way; and there shall not pass by there any
  unclean person, neither shall there be there an unclean way; but the
  dispersed shall walk on it, and they shall not go astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And there shall be no lion there, neither shall
  any evil beast go up upon it, nor at all be found there; but the redeemed and
  gathered on the Lordâ€™s behalf, shall walk in it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and
  everlasting joy shall be over their head; for on their head shall be praise
  and exultation, and joy shall take possession of them: sorrow and pain, and
  groaning have fled away.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah36">36</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now it came to pass in the
  fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias, that Sennacherim, king of the
  Assyrians, came up against the strong cities of Judea, and took them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the king of the Assyrians sent
  Rabsaces out of Laches to Jerusalem to king Ezekias with a large force: and
  he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fullerâ€™s field.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And there went forth to him Heliakim
  the steward, the son of Chelcias, and Somnas the scribe, and Joach the son of
  Asaph, the recorder. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Rabsaces said
  to them, Say to Ezekias, Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians,
  Why art thou secure? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Is war carried on
  with counsel and mere words of the lips? and now on whom dost thou trust,
  that thou rebellest against me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Behold, thou trustest on this bruised staff of reed, on Egypt: as soon as a
  man leans upon it, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao
  king of Egypt and all that trust in him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But if ye say, We trust in the Lord our God;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> yet now make an agreement with my lord
  the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if ye
  shall be able to set riders upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And how can ye then turn to the face of the satraps? They that trust on the
  Egyptians for horse and rider, are our servants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And now, Have we come up against this land to
  fight against it without the Lord? The Lord said to me, Go up against this
  land, and destroy it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then Eliakim
  and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue;
  for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and wherefore
  speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Rabsaces said to them, Has my lord sent me to
  your lord or to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that
  sit on the wall, that they may eat dung, and drink their water together with
  you? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Rabsaces stood and cried
  with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the
  great king, the king of the Assyrians: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> thus says the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you
  with words: he will not be able to deliver you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And let not Ezekias say to you, That God will
  deliver you, and this city will not at all be delivered into the hand of the
  king of the Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Hearken not to
  Ezekias: thus says the king of the Assyrians, If ye wish to be blessed, come
  out to me: and ye shall eat every one of his vine and his fig-trees, and ye
  shall drink water out of your own cisterns: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> until I come and take you to a land, like your
  own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread, and vineyards. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Let not Ezekias deceive you, saying, God will
  deliver you. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out
  of the hand of the king of the Assyrians? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Where is the god of Emath, and Arphath? and where
  is the god of Eppharuaim? have they been able to deliver Samaria out of my
  hand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Which is the god of all these
  nations, that has delivered his land out of my hand, that God should deliver
  Jerusalem out of my hand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they
  were silent, and none answered him a word; because the king had commanded
  that none should answer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Heliakim
  the son of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the military scribe, and Joach
  the son of Asaph, the recorder, came in to Ezekias, having their garments
  rent, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah37">37</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass, when king
  Ezekias heard it, that he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and went up
  to the house of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he sent
  Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests
  clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said
  to him, Thus says Ezekias, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> To-day is a
  day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are
  come upon the travailing woman, but she has not strength to bring forth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> May the Lord thy God hear the words of
  Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living
  God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard:
  therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye
  say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words
  which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians
  have reproached me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold, I will
  send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own
  country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the
  Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians
  went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent
  messengers to Ezekias, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thus
  shall ye say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou
  trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the
  hand of the king of the Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have
  destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Have the gods of the nations which my fathers
  destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in
  the land of Theemath? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Where are the
  kings of Emath? and where is the king of Arphath? and where is the king of
  the city of Eppharuaim, and of Anagugana? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Ezekias received the letter from the
  messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it
  before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Ezekias prayed
  to the Lord, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> O Lord of hosts,
  God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every
  kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open
  thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which
  he has sent to reproach the living God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians
  have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and have cast their idols into the fire: for,
  they were no gods, but the work of menâ€™s hands, wood and stone; and they have
  cast them away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But now, O Lord our
  God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that
  thou art God alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Esaias the
  son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the
  God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of
  the Assyrians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> This is the word which
  God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised thee,
  and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Whom hast thou reproached and
  provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not
  lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers;
  for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the
  height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have cropped the
  height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the
  height of the forest region: <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and I
  have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Hast thou not heard of these things
  which I did of old? I appointed them from ancient times; but now have I
  manifested my purpose of desolating nations in their strong holds, and them
  that dwell in strong cities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I
  weakened their hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the
  house-tops, and as grass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But now I
  know thy rest, and thy going out, and thy coming in. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And thy wrath wherewith thou hast been enraged,
  and thy rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in thy nose,
  and a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou
  camest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And this shall be a sign to
  thee, Eat this year what thou hast sown; and the second year that which is
  left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the
  fruit of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they that are left
  in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> for out of Jerusalem there shall be a remnant,
  and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall
  perform this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Therefore thus saith
  the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this
  city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a
  rampart round it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But by the way by
  which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city:
  thus saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I will protect
  this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant Davidâ€™s sake.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the angel of the Lord went forth,
  and slew out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand:
  and they arose in the morning and found all these bodies dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and
  departed, and dwelt in Nineve. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  while he was worshipping Nasarach his countryâ€™s god in the house, Adramelech
  and Sarasar his sons smote him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia:
  and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah38">38</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass at that time,
  that Ezekias was sick even to death. And Esaias the prophet the son of Amos
  came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give orders concerning thy
  house: for thou shalt die, and not live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and
  prayed to the Lord, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Remember,
  O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, with a true heart, and have
  done that which was pleasing in thy sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father,
  I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy time
  fifteen years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will deliver thee
  and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend
  this city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And this shall be a sign to
  thee from the Lord, that God will do this thing; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees
  of the dial by which ten degrees on the house of thy father the sun has gone
  downâ€”I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten
  degrees by which the shadow had gone down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> THE PRAYER OF EZEKIAS KING OF JUDEA, WHEN HE HAD
  BEEN SICK, AND WAS RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the
  gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation
  of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of
  Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> My life has failed from among my kindred: I have
  parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me,
  as one that having pitched a tent takes it down again: my breath was with me
  as a weaverâ€™s web, when she that weaves draws nigh to cut off the thread.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> In that day I was given up as to a
  lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up
  from day even to night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> As a swallow,
  so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for mine eyes have failed with
  looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me, and
  removed the sorrow of my soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Yea, O
  Lord, for it was told thee concerning this; and thou hast revived my breath;
  and I am comforted, and live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For
  thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all
  my sins behind me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For they that are
  in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee,
  neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The living shall bless thee, as I also do: for
  from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare thy righteousness,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> O God of my salvation; and I will not
  cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the
  house of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Now Esaias had said to
  Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and
  thou shalt be well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Ezekias said,
  This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah39">39</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> At that time Marodach Baladan, the
  son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts
  to Ezekias: for he had heard that he had been sick even to death, and was
  recovered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Ezekias was glad of
  their coming, and he shewed them the house of his spices, and of silver, and
  gold, and myrrh, and incense, and ointment, and all the houses of his
  treasures, and all that he had in his stores: and there was nothing in his
  house, nor in all his dominion, which Ezekias did not shew. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and
  said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to thee? and Ezekias
  said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Esaias said, What have they seen in thine
  house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is
  nothing in my house which they have not seen: yea, also the possessions in my
  treasuries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Esaias said to him,
  Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the things that are in thine
  house, and all that thy fathers have gathered until this day, shall go to
  Babylon; and they shall not leave anything at all: and God hath said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that they shall take also of thy
  children whom thou shalt beget; and they shall make them eunuchs in the house
  of the king of the Babylonians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he hath spoken:
  let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah40">40</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,
  saith God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak, ye priests, to the
  heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is accomplished, her sin
  is put away: for she has received of the Lordâ€™s hand double the amount of her
  sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The voice of one crying in the
  wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Every valley shall be filled, and
  every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and all the crooked ways shall
  become straight, and the rough places plains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all
  flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The voice of one saying, Cry; and I
  said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the
  flower of grass: (8) The grass withers, and the flower fades: but the word of
  our God abides for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> O thou that
  bringest glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up thy voice
  with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear
  not; say unto the cities of Juda, Behold your God! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with
  strength, and his arm is with power: behold, his reward is with him, and his
  work before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He shall tend his
  flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall
  soothe them that are with young. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Who
  has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the
  earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests
  in a balance? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Who has known the mind
  of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has
  instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way
  of understanding; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> since all the
  nations are counted as a drop from a bucket, and as the turning of a balance,
  and shall be counted as spittle? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  Libanus is not enough to burn, nor all beasts enough for a whole-burnt
  offering: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and all the nations are as
  nothing, and counted as nothing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> To
  whom have ye compared the Lord? and with what likeness have ye compared him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Has not the artificer made an image,
  or the goldsmith having melted gold, gilt it over, and made it a similitude?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the artificer chooses out a wood
  that will not rot, and will wisely enquire how he shall set up his image, and
  that so that it should not be moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Will ye not know? will ye not hear? has it not been told you of old? Have ye
  not known the foundations of the earth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> It is he that comprehends the circle of the
  earth, and the inhabitants in it are as grasshoppers; he that set up the
  heaven as a chamber, and stretched it out as a tent to dwell in: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> he that appoints princes to rule as nothing, and
  has made the earth as nothing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For
  they shall not plant, neither shall they sow, neither shall their root be
  fixed in the ground: he has blown upon them, and they are withered, and a
  storm shall carry them away like sticks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Now then to whom have ye compared me, that I may
  be exalted? saith the Holy One. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Lift
  up your eyes on high, and see, who has displayed all these things? even he
  that brings forth his host by number: he shall call them all by name by means
  of his great glory, and by the power of his might: nothing has escaped thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For say not thou, O Jacob, and why
  hast thou spoken, Israel, saying, My way is hid from God, and my God has
  taken away my judgement, and has departed? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And now, hast thou not known? hast thou not
  heard? the eternal God, the God that formed the ends of the earth, shall not
  hunger, nor be weary, and there is no searching of his understanding.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> He gives strength to the hungry, and
  sorrow to them that are not suffering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For the young men shall hunger, and the youths
  shall be weary, and the choice men shall be powerless: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> but they that wait on God shall renew their
  strength; they shall put forth new feathers like eagles; they shall run, and
  not be weary; they shall walk, and not hunger.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah41">41</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hold a feast to me, ye islands: for
  the princes shall renew their strength: let them draw nigh and speak
  together: then let them declare judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Who raised up righteousness from the east, and
  called it to his feet, so that it should go? shall appoint it an adversary of
  Gentiles, and shall dismay kings, and bury their swords in the earth, and
  cast forth their bows and arrows as sticks? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he shall pursue them; the way of his feet
  shall proceed in peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Who has
  wrought and done these things? he has called it who called it from the
  generations of old; I God, the first and to all futurity, I AM. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The nations saw, and feared; the ends of the earth
  drew nigh, and came together, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> every
  one judging for his neighbor and that to assist his brother: and one will
  say, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The artificer has become strong,
  and the coppersmith that smites with the hammer, and forges also: sometimes
  he will say, It is a piece well joined: they have fastened them with nails;
  they will fix them, and they shall not be moved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But thou, Israel, art my servant Jacob, and he
  whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraam, whom I have loved: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the
  earth, and from the high places of it I have called thee, and said to thee,
  Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and I have not forsaken thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Fear not; for I am with thee: wander
  not; for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee; and I have helped thee,
  and have established thee with my just right hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Behold, all thine adversaries shall be ashamed
  and confounded; for they shall be as if they were not: and all thine
  opponents shall perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thou shalt
  seek them, and thou shalt not find the men who shall insolently rage against
  thee: for they shall be as if they were not, and they that war against thee
  shall not be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For I am thy God, who
  holdeth thy right hand, who saith to thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Fear not, Jacob, and thou Israel few in number; I
  have helped thee, saith thy God, he that redeems thee, O Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Behold, I have made thee as new saw-shaped
  threshing wheels of a waggon; and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat
  the hills to powder, and make them as chaff: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall
  carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them: but thou shalt rejoice in
  the holy ones of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the poor
  and the needy shall exult; for when they shall seek water, and there shall be
  none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord God, I the God of
  Israel will hear, and will not forsake them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> but I will open rivers on the mountains, and
  fountains in the midst of plains: I will make the desert pools of water, and
  a thirsty land watercourses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I will
  plant in the dry land the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress, and white
  poplar: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> that they may see, and know,
  and perceive, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has wrought
  these works, and the Holy One of Israel has displayed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Your judgment draws nigh, saith the Lord God;
  your counsels have drawn nigh, saith the King of Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let them draw nigh, and declare to you what
  things shall come to pass; or tell us what things were of old, and we will
  apply our understanding, and we shall know what are the last and the future
  things: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> tell us, declare ye to us the
  things that are coming on at the last time, and we shall know that ye are
  gods: do good, and do evil, and we shall wonder, and see at the same time
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> whence ye are, and whence is your
  works: they have chosen you an abomination out of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But I have raised up him that comes from the
  north, and him that comes from the rising of the sun: they shall be called by
  my name: let the princes come, and as potterâ€™s clay, and as a potter treading
  clay, so shall ye be trodden down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  For who will declare the things from the beginning, that we may know also the
  former things, and we will say that they are true? there is no one that
  speaks beforehand, nor anyone that hears your words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I will give dominion to Sion, and will comfort
  Jerusalem by the way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For from among
  the nations, behold, there was no one; and of their idols there was none to
  declare anything: and if I should ask them, Whence are ye? they could not
  answer me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For these are your makers,
  as ye think, and they that cause you to err in vain.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah42">42</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Jacob is my servant, I will help
  him: Israel is my chosen, my soul has accepted him; I have put my Spirit upon
  him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He shall not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor shall
  his voice be heard without. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> A bruised
  reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; but he shall
  bring forth judgment to truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He
  shall shine out, and shall not be discouraged, until he have set judgment on
  the earth: and in his name shall the Gentiles trust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus saith the Lord God, who made the heaven, and
  established it; who settled the earth, and the things in it, and gives breath
  to the people on it, and spirit to them that tread on it: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I the Lord God have called thee in righteousness,
  and will hold thine hand, and will strengthen thee: and I have given thee for
  the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> to open the eyes of the blind, to bring the bound
  and them that sit in darkness out of bonds and the prison-house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I am the Lord God: that is my name: I will not
  give my glory to another, nor my praises to graven images. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Behold, the ancient things have come to pass, and
  so will the new things which I tell you: yea, before I tell them they are
  made known to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Sing a new hymn to
  the Lord: ye who are his dominion, glorify his name from the end of the
  earth: ye that go down to the sea, and sail upon it; the islands, and they
  that dwell in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Rejoice, thou
  wilderness, and the villages thereof, the hamlets, and the dwellers in Kedar:
  the inhabitants of the rock shall rejoice, they shall shout from the top of
  the mountains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They shall give glory
  to God, and shall proclaim his praises in the islands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and crush
  the war: he shall stir up jealousy, and shall shout mightily against his
  enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have been silent: shall I
  also always be silent and forbear: I have endured like a travailing woman: I
  will now amaze and wither at once. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I
  will make desolate mountains and hills, and will dry up all their grass; and
  I will make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will bring the blind by a way that they
  knew not, and I will cause them to tread paths which they have not known: I
  will turn darkness into light for them, and crooked things into straight.
  These things will I do, and will not forsake them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But they are turned back: be ye utterly ashamed
  that trust in graven images, who say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Hear, ye deaf, and look up, ye blind,
  to see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And who is blind, but my
  servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? yea, the servants of God
  have been made blind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Ye have often
  seen, and have not taken heed; your ears have been opened, and ye have not
  heard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The Lord God has taken counsel
  that he might be justified, and might magnify his praise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I beheld, and the people were spoiled and
  plundered: for there is a snare in the secret chambers everywhere, and in the
  houses also, where they have hidden them: they became a spoil, and there was
  no one that delivered the prey, and there was none who said, Restore.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Who is there among you that will give
  ear to these things? hearken ye to the things which are coming to pass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For what did he give to Jacob up to
  spoil, and Israel to them that plundered him? Did not God do it against whom
  they sinned? and they would not walk in his ways, nor hearken to his law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So he brought upon them the fury of
  his wrath; and the war, and those that burnt round about them, prevailed
  against them; yet no one of them knew it, neither did they lay it to
  heart.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah43">43</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And now thus saith the Lord God
  that made thee, O Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have
  redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And if thou pass through water, I am with thee;
  and the rivers shall not overflow thee: and if thou go through fire, thou
  shalt not be burned; the flame shall not burn thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
  that saves thee: I have made Egypt and Ethiopia thy ransom, and given Soene
  for thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Since thou becamest precious
  in my sight, thou hast become glorious, and I have loved thee: and I will
  give men for thee, and princes for thy life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy
  seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I will say to the north, Bring; and to the south,
  Keep not back; bring my sons from the land afar off, and my daughters from
  the ends of the earth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> even all who
  are called by my name: for I have prepared him for my glory, and I have
  formed him, and have made him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and I
  have brought forth the blind people; for their eyes are alike blind, and they
  that have ears are deaf. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> All the
  nations are gathered together, and princes shall be gathered out of them: who
  will declare these things? or who will declare to you things from the
  beginning? let them bring forth their witnesses, and be justified; and let
  them hear, and declare the truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Be
  ye my witnesses, and I too am a witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant
  whom I have chosen: that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am
  he: before me there was no other God, and after me there shall be none.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I am God; and beside me there is no
  Saviour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I have declared, and have
  saved; I have reproached, and there was no strange god among you: ye are my
  witnesses, and I am the Lord God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  even from the beginning; and there is none that can deliver out of my hands:
  I will work, and who shall turn it back? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus saith the Lord God that redeems you, the
  Holy One of Israel; for your sakes I will send to Babylon, and I will stir up
  all that flee, and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I am the Lord God, your Holy One, who have
  appointed for Israel your king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thus
  saith the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty water;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> who brought forth chariots and horse,
  and a mighty multitude: but they have lain down, and shall not rise: they are
  extinct, as quenched flax. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Remember
  ye not the former things, and consider not the ancient things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Behold, I will do new things, which shall
  presently spring forth, and ye shall know them: and I will make a way in the
  wilderness, and rivers in the dry land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> the beasts of the field shall bless me, the owls
  and young ostriches; for I have given water in the wilderness, and rivers in
  the dry land, to give drink to my chosen race, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> my people whom I have preserved to tell forth my
  praises. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I have not now called thee,
  O Jacob; neither have I made thee weary, O Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Thou hast not brought me the sheep of thy
  whole-burnt-offering; neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I
  have not caused thee to serve with sacrifices, neither have I wearied thee
  with frankincense. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Neither hast thou
  purchased for me victims for silver, neither have I desired the fat of thy
  sacrifices: but thou didst stand before me in thy sins, and in thine
  iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> I, even I, am he that
  blots out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and thy sins; and I will not
  remember them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But do thou remember,
  and let us plead together: do thou first confess thy transgressions, that
  thou mayest be justified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Your
  fathers first, and your princes have transgressed against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the princes have defiled my sanctuaries: so I
  gave Jacob to enemies to destroy, and Israel to reproach.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah44">44</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But now hear, Jacob my servant; and
  Israel, whom I have chosen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Thus saith
  the Lord God that made thee, and he that formed thee from the womb; Thou
  shalt yet be helped: fear not, my servant Jacob; and beloved Israel, whom I
  have chosen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I will give water to
  the thirsty that walk in a dry land: I will put my Spirit upon thy seed, and
  my blessings upon thy children: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and
  they shall spring up as grass between brooks, and as willows on the banks of
  running water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> One shall say, I am Godâ€™
   s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall
  write with his hand, I am Godâ€™s, and shall call himself by the name of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thus saith God the King of
  Israel, and the God of hosts that delivered him; I am the first, and I am
  hereafter: beside me there is no God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Who is like me? let him stand, and call, and declare, and prepare for me from
  the time that I made man for ever; and let them tell you the things that are
  coming before they arrive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Hide not
  yourselves, nor go astray: have ye not heard from the beginning, and have not
  I told you? ye are witnesses if there is a God beside me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But they that framed false gods did not then
  hearken; and they that graved images are all vain, performing their own
  desires, which shall not profit them, but they shall be ashamed <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> that form a god, and all that grave worthless
  things: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and all by whom they were
  made are withered: yea, let all the deaf be gathered from among men, and let
  them stand together; and let them be ashamed and confounded together:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For the artificer sharpens the iron;
  he fashions the idol with an axe, and fixes it with an awl, and fashions it
  with the strength of his arm: and he will be hungry and weak, and will drink
  no water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The artificer having chosen
  a piece of wood, marks it out with a rule, and fits it with glue, and makes
  it as the form of a man, and as the beauty of a man, to set it up in the
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He cuts wood out of the
  forest, which the Lord planted, even a pine tree, and the rain made it grow,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> that it might be for men to burn: and
  having taken part of it he warms himself; yea, they burn part of it, and bake
  loaves thereon; and of the rest they make for themselves gods, and they
  worship them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Half thereof he burns
  in the fire, and with half of it he bakes loaves on the coals; and having
  roasted flesh on it he eats, and is satisfied, and having warmed himself he
  says, I am comfortable, for I have warmed myself, and have seen the fire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the rest he makes a graven god,
  and worships, and prays, saying, Deliver me; for thou art my God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They have no understanding to
  perceive; for they have been blinded so that they should not see with their
  eyes, nor perceive with their heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And one has not considered in his mind, nor known in his understanding, that
  he has burnt up half of it in the fire, and baked loaves on the coals thereof
  and has roasted and eaten flesh, and of the rest of it he has made an
  abomination, and they worship it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they err, and no one is able to
  deliver his soul: see, ye will not say, There is a lie in my right hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Remember these things, O Jacob and
  Israel; for thou art my servant; I have formed thee to be my servant: and do
  thou, Israel, not forget me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For
  behold, I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions, and thy sin as
  darkness: turn to me, and I will redeem thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Rejoice, ye heavens; for God has had mercy upon
  Israel: sound the trumpet, ye foundations of the earth: ye mountains, shout
  with joy, ye hills, and all the trees therein: for God has redeemed Jacob,
  and Israel shall be glorified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Thus
  saith the Lord that redeems thee, and who formed thee from the womb, I am the
  Lord that performs all things: I stretched out the heaven alone, and
  established the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Who else will
  frustrate the tokens of those that have divining spirits, and prophecies from
  the heart of man? turning the wise back, and making their counsel
  foolishness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and confirming the word
  of his servant, and verifying the counsel of his messengers: who says to
  Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Idumea, Ye shall be
  built, and her desert places shall spring forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Who says to the deep, Thou shalt be dried up, and
  I will dry up the rivers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Who bids
  Cyrus be wise, and he shall perform all my will: who says to Jerusalem, Thou
  shalt be built, and I will lay the foundation of my holy house.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah45">45</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus saith the Lord God to my
  anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, that nations might be obedient
  before him; and I will break through the strength of kings; I will open doors
  before him, and cities shall not be closed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I will go before thee, and will level mountains: I
  will break to pieces brazen doors, and burst iron bars. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, I
  will open to thee hidden, unseen treasures, that thou mayest know that I, the
  Lord thy God, that call thee by name, am the God of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel mine
  elect, I will call thee by thy name, and accept thee: but thou hast not known
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For I am the Lord God, and there
  is no other God beside me; I strengthened thee, and thou hast not known me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> That they that come from the east and
  they that come from the west may know that there is no God but me. I am the
  Lord God, and there is none beside. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I
  am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create
  evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the
  clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom with mercy,
  and bring forth righteousness likewise: I am the Lord that created thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What excellent thing have I prepared
  as clay of the potter? Will the ploughman plough the earth all day? shall the
  clay say to the potter, What art thou doing that thou dost not work, nor hast
  hands? shall the thing formed answer him that formed it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> As though one should say to his father, What wilt
  thou beget me? and to his mother, What art thou bringing forth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of
  Israel, who has formed the things that are to come, Enquire of me concerning
  my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my
  hand have established the heaven; I have given commandment to all the stars.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I have raised him up to be a king
  with righteousness, and all his ways are right: he shall build my city, and
  shall turn the captivity of my people, not for ransoms, nor for rewards,
  saith the Lord of hosts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus saith
  the Lord of hosts, Egypt has laboured for thee; and the merchandise of the
  Ethiopians, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over to thee, and
  shall be thy servants; and they shall follow after thee bound in fetters, and
  shall pass over to thee, and shall do obeisance to thee, and make
  supplication to thee: because God is in thee; and there is no God beside
  thee, O Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For thou art God, yet
  we knew it not, the God of Israel, the Saviour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> All that are opposed to him shall be ashamed and
  confounded, and shall walk in shame: ye isles, keep a feast to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Israel is saved by the Lord with an
  everlasting salvation: they shall not be ashamed nor confounded for evermore.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thus saith the Lord that made the
  heaven, this God that created the earth, and made it; he marked it out, he
  made it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there
  is none beside. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I have not spoken in
  secret, nor in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob,
  Seek vanity: I, even I, am the Lord, speaking righteousness, and proclaiming
  truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Assemble yourselves and come;
  take counsel together, ye that escape of the nations: they that set up wood,
  even their graven image, have no knowledge, nor they who pray to gods that do
  not save. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> If they will declare, let
  them draw nigh, that they may know together, who has caused these things to
  be heard from the beginning: then was it told you. I am God, and there is not
  another beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none but me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Turn ye to me, and ye shall be saved,
  ye that come from the end of the earth: I am God, and there is none other.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> By myself I swear, righteousness
  shall surely proceed out of my mouth; my words shall not be frustrated; that
  to me every knee shall bend, and every tongue shall swear by God, (24)
  saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him: and all that remove them
  from their borders shall be ashamed. (25) By the Lord shall they be
  justified, and in God shall all the seed of the children of Israel be
  glorified.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to

  same time helpless man; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> who will not
  be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led away
  captive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Hear me, O house of Jacob,

  by me from infancy, even to old age: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I

  they put it upon its place, it remains, it cannot move: and whosoever shall
  cry to it, it cannot hear; it cannot save him from trouble. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Remember ye these things, and groan: repent, ye
  that have gone astray, return in your heart; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and remember the former things that were of old:
  for I am God, and there is none other beside me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> telling beforehand the latter events before they
  come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, all my counsel
  shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> calling a bird from the east, and from a land
  afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought
  him; I have created and made him; I have brought him, and prospered his way.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Hearken to me, ye senseless ones,
  that are far from righteousness: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I
  have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation
  that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Come down, sit on the ground, O
  virgin daughter of Babylon: sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans:
  for thou shalt no more be called tender and luxurious. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Take a millstone, grind meal: remove thy veil,
  uncover thy white hairs, make bare the leg, pass through the rivers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy
  reproaches shall be brought to light: I will exact of thee due vengeance, I
  will no longer deliver thee to men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Thy deliverer is the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Sit thou down pierced with woe, go
  into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no more be called the
  strength of a kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I have been
  provoked with my people; thou hast defiled mine inheritance: I gave them into
  thy hand, but thou didst not extend mercy to them: thou madest the yoke of
  the aged man very heavy, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and saidst, I
  shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not perceive these things in thine
  heart, nor didst thou remember the latter end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But now hear these words, thou luxurious one, who
  art the one that sits at ease, that is secure, that says in her heart, I am,
  and there is not another; I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know
  bereavement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But now these two things
  shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, the loss of children and widowhood
  shall come suddenly upon thee, for thy sorcery, for the strength of thine
  enchantments, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for thy trusting in
  wickedness: for thou saidst, I am, and there is not another: know thou, the
  understanding of these things and thy harlotry shall be thy shame; for thou
  saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is not another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And destruction shall come upon thee, and thou
  shalt not be aware; there shall be a pit, and thou shalt fall into it: and
  grief shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be clear; and
  destruction shall come suddenly upon thee, and thou shalt not know.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Stand now with thine enchantments,
  and with the abundance of thy sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy
  youth; if thou canst be profited. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand
  and deliver thee, let them that see the stars tell thee what is about to come
  upon thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Behold, they all shall be
  burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life
  from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit thou upon them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> these shall be thy help. Thou hast
  wearied thyself with traffic from thy youth: every man has wandered to his
  own home, but thou shalt have no deliverance.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah48">48</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear these words, ye house of
  Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of Juda,
  who swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, making mention of it, but
  not with truth, nor with righteousness; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> maintaining also the name of the holy city, and
  staying themselves on the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name. The
  former things I have already declared; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  and they that have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I
  wrought suddenly, and the events came to pass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I know that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an
  iron sinew, and thy forehead brazen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And I told thee of old what should be before it came upon thee; I made it
  known to thee, lest thou shouldest say, My idols have done it for me; and
  shouldest say, My graven and molten images have commanded me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye have heard all this, but ye have not known: yet
  I have made known to thee the new things from henceforth, which are coming to
  pass, and thou saidst not, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Now they
  come to pass, and not formerly: and thou heardest not of them in former days:
  say not thou, Yea, I know them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thou
  hast neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened
  thine ears: for I knew that thou wouldest surely deal treacherously, and
  wouldest be called a transgressor even from the womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For mine own sake will I shew thee my wrath, and
  will bring before thee my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Behold, I have sold thee, but not for
  silver; but I have rescued thee from the furnace of affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For mine own sake I will do this for thee,
  because my name is profaned; and I will not give my glory to another.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I
  call; I am the first, and I endure for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My hand also has founded the earth, and my right
  hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And all shall be gathered, and shall
  hear: who has told them these things? Out of love to thee I have fulfilled
  thy desire on Babylon, to abolish the seed of the Chaldeans. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him,
  and made his way prosperous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Draw
  nigh to me, and hear ye these words; I have not spoken in secret from the
  beginning: when it took place, there was I, and now the Lord, even the Lord,
  and his Spirit, hath sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thus
  saith the Lord that delivered thee, the Holy One of Israel; I am thy God, I
  have shewn thee how thou shouldest find the way wherein thou shouldest walk.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if thou hadst hearkened to my
  commandments, then would thy peace have been like a river, and thy
  righteousness as a wave of the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy belly as
  the dust of the ground: neither now shalt thou by any means be utterly
  destroyed, neither shall thy name perish before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Go forth of Babylon, thou that fleest from the
  Chaldeans: utter aloud a voice of joy, and let this be made known, proclaim
  it to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath delivered his servant
  Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if they shall thirst, he
  shall lead them through the desert; he shall bring forth water to them out of
  the rock: the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow forth, and my
  people shall drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> There is no joy,
  saith the Lord, to the ungodly.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah49">49</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hearken to me, ye islands; and
  attend, ye Gentiles; after a long time it shall come to pass, saith the Lord:
  from my motherâ€™s womb he has called my name: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and he has made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he
  has hid me under the shadow of his hand; he has made me as a choice shaft,
  and he has hid me in his quiver; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and
  said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, and in thee I will be glorified.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Then I said, I have laboured in vain,
  I have given my strength for vanity and for nothing: therefore is my judgment
  with the Lord, and my labour before my God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now, thus saith the Lord that formed me from
  the womb to be his own servant, to gather Jacob to him and Israel. I shall be
  gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to me, It is a great thing
  for thee to be called my servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob, and to
  recover the dispersion of Israel: behold, I have given thee for the covenant
  of a race, for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation
  to the end of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thus saith
  the Lord that delivered thee, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises
  his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of
  princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship
  him, for the Lordâ€™s sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have
  chosen thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thus saith the Lord, In
  an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I
  succored thee: and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of the
  nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert
  heritages: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> saying to them that are in
  bonds, Go forth; and bidding them that are in darkness shew themselves. They
  shall be fed in all the ways, and in all the paths shall be their pasture.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They shall not hunger, neither shall
  they thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; but he that has
  mercy on them shall comfort them, and by fountains of waters shall he lead
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I will make every mountain
  a way, and every path a pasture to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Behold, these shall come from far: and these from
  the north and the west, and others from the land of the Persians.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Rejoice, ye heavens; and let the
  earth be glad: let the mountains break forth with joy; for the Lard has had
  mercy on his people, and has comforted the lowly ones of his people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken
  me, and, The Lord has forgotten me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have compassion upon the
  offspring of her womb? but if a woman should even forget these, yet I will
  not forget thee, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Behold, I have painted thy walls on my hands, and thou art continually before
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And thou shalt soon be built by
  those by whom thou were destroyed, and they that made thee desolate shall go
  forth of thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Lift up thine eyes
  round about, and look on them all; behold, they are gathered together, and
  are come to thee. As I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt clothe thyself with
  them all as with an ornament, and put them on as a bride her attire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For thy desert and marred and ruined
  places shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that
  devoured thee shall be removed far from thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For thy sons whom thou hast lost shall say in
  thine ears, The place is too narrow for me: make room for me that I may
  dwell. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And thou shalt say in thine
  heart, Who has begotten me these? whereas I was childless, and a widow; but
  who has brought up these for me? and I was left alone; but whence came these
  to me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thus saith the Lord, even the
  Lord, Behold, I lift up mine hand to the nations, and I will lift up my
  signal to the islands: and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and
  shall bear thy daughters on their shoulders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their
  princesses thy nurses, they shall bow down to thee on the face of the earth,
  and shall lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,
  and they that wait on me shall not be ashamed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Will any one take spoils from a giant? and if one
  should take a man captive unjustly, shall he be delivered? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For thus saith the Lord, If one should take a
  giant captive, he shall take spoils, and he who takes them from a mighty man
  shall be delivered: for I will plead thy cause, and I will deliver thy
  children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they that afflicted
  thee shall eat their own flesh; and they shall drink their own blood as new
  wine, and shall be drunken: and all flesh shall perceive that I am the Lord
  that delivers thee, and that upholds the strength of Jacob.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah50">50</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind
  is your motherâ€™s bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which
  debtor have I sold you? Behold, ye are sold for your sins, and for your
  iniquities have I put your mother away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Why did I come, and there was no man? why did I
  call, and there was none to hearken? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can
  I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a
  wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and
  shall die for thirst. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will clothe
  the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The Lord even God gives me the tongue of
  instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me
  early, he has given me an ear to hear: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not
  disobey, nor dispute. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I gave my back
  to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the
  shame of spitting: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but the Lord God
  became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid
  rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> for he that has justified me draws near; who is he
  that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yea, who
  is he that pleads with me? let him draw nigh to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will
  hurt me? behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Who is among you that fears the
  Lord? let him hearken to the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness,
  and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Behold, ye all kindle a fire, and
  feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which ye have
  kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; ye shall lie down in
  sorrow.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah51">51</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hearken to me, ye that follow after
  righteousness, and seek the Lord: look to the solid rock, which ye have hewn,
  and to the hole of the pit which ye have dug. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Look to Abraam your father, and to Sarrha that
  bore you: for he was alone when I called him, and blessed him, and loved him,
  and multiplied him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And now I will
  comfort thee, O Sion: and I have comforted all her desert places; and I will
  make her desert places as a garden, and her western places as the garden of
  the Lord; they shall find in her gladness and exultation, thanksgiving and
  the voice of praise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hear me, hear me,
  my people; and ye kings, hearken to me: for a law shall proceed from me, and
  my judgment shall be for a light of the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> My righteousness speedily draws nigh, and my
  salvation shall go forth as light, and on mine arm shall the Gentiles trust:
  the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Lift up your eyes to the sky, and look on the
  earth beneath: for the sky was darkened like smoke, and the earth shall wax
  old like a garment, and the inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my
  righteousness shall not fail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Hear me,
  ye that know judgment, the people in whose heart is my law: fear not the
  reproach of men, and be not overcome by their contempt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For as a garment will be devoured by time, and as
  wool will be devoured by a moth, so shall they be consumed; but my
  righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation for all generations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, and put on
  the strength of thine arm; awake as in the early time, as the ancient
  generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Art thou not it that
  dried the sea, the water, even the abundance of the deep; that made the
  depths of the sea a way of passage for the delivered and redeemed?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> for by the help of the Lord they
  shall return, and come to Sion with joy and everlasting exultation, for
  praise and joy shall come upon their head: pain, and grief, and groaning,
  have fled away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I, even I, am he that
  comforts thee: consider who thou art, that thou wast afraid of mortal man,
  and of the son of man, who are withered as grass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou hast forgotten God who made thee, who
  made the sky and founded the earth; and thou wert continually afraid because
  of the wrath of him that afflicted thee: for whereas he counselled to take
  thee away, yet now where is the wrath of him that afflicted thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For in thy deliverance he shall not
  halt, nor tarry; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for I am thy God,
  that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of
  hosts is my name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I will put my words
  into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of mine hand, with
  which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and the Lord shall say to Sion,
  Thou art my people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Awake, awake,
  stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his
  fury: for thou hast drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of
  wrath: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and there was none to comfort
  thee of all the children whom thou borest; and there was none to take hold of
  thine hand, not even of all the children whom thou has reared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Wherefore these things are against thee; who
  shall sympathize with thee in thy grief? downfall, and destruction, famine,
  and sword: who shall comfort thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Thy sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a
  half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to
  faint by the Lord God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Therefore
  hear, thou afflicted one, and drunken, but not with wine; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> thus saith the Lord God that judges his people,
  Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my
  wrath; and thou shalt not drink it any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I will give it into the hands of them that
  injured thee, and them that afflicted thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down,
  that we may pass over: and thou didst level thy body with the ground to them
  passing by without.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah52">52</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Awake, awake, Sion; put on thy
  strength, O Sion; and o thou put on thy glory, Jerusalem the holy city: there
  shall no more pass through thee, the uncircumcised and unclean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Shake off the dust and arise; sit down, Jerusalem:
  put off the band of thy neck, captive daughter of Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For thus saith the Lord, Ye have been sold for
  nought; and ye shall not be ransomed with silver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thus saith the Lord, My people went down before to
  Egypt to sojourn there; and were carried away forcibly to the Assyrians.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now why are ye here? Thus saith
  the Lord, Because my people was taken for nothing, wonder ye and howl. Thus
  saith the Lord, On account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore shall my people
  know my name in that day, for I am he that speaks: I am present, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> as a season of beauty upon the mountains, as the
  feet of one preaching glad tidings of peace, as one preaching good news: for
  I will publish thy salvation, saying, O Sion, thy God shall reign.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the voice of them that guard thee
  is exalted, and with the voice together they shall rejoice: for eyes shall
  look to eyes, when the Lord shall have mercy upon Sion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Let the waste places of Jerusalem break forth in
  joy together, because the Lord has had mercy upon her, and has delivered
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord shall reveal
  his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth
  shall see the salvation that comes from our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Depart ye, depart, go out from thence, and touch
  not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her; separate yourselves,
  ye that bear the vessels of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  For ye shall not go forth with tumult, neither go by flight: for the Lord
  shall go first in advance of you; and the God of Israel shall be he that
  brings up your rear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Behold, my
  servant shall understand, and be exalted, and glorified exceedingly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> As many shall be amazed at thee, so
  shall thy face be without glory from men, and thy glory shall not be honoured
  by the sons of men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus shall many
  nations wonder at him; and kings shall keep their mouths shut: for they to
  whom no report was brought concerning him, shall see; and they who have not
  heard, shall consider.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah53">53</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O Lord, who has believed our
  report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> We brought a report as of a child before him; he
  is as a root in a thirsty land: he has no form nor comeliness; and we saw
  him, but he had no form nor beauty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men; he was
  a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of sickness, for his face
  is turned from us: he was dishonoured, and not esteemed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He bears our sins, and is pained for us: yet we
  accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in affliction.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But he was wounded on account of our
  sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our
  peace was upon him; and by his bruises we were healed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> All we as sheep have gone astray; every one has
  gone astray in his way; and the Lord gave him up for our sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he, because of his affliction, opens not his
  mouth: he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the
  shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
  who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth:
  because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the
  rich for his death; for he practised no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The Lord also is pleased to purge him
  from his stroke. If ye can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a
  long-lived seed: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> the Lord also is
  pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to shew him light, and to
  form him with understanding; to justify the just one who serves many well;
  and he shall bear their sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the
  mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and he was numbered among
  the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of
  their iniquities.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Rejoice, thou barren that bearest
  not; break forth and cry, thou that dost not travail: for more are the
  children of the desolate than of her that has a husband: for the Lord has
  said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Enlarge the place of thy tent,
  and of thy curtains: fix the pins, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and
  strengthen thy pins; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> spread forth thy
  tent yet to the right and the left: for thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles,
  and thou shalt make the desolate cities to be inhabited. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Fear not, because thou has been put to shame,
  neither be confounded, because thou was reproached: for thou shalt forget thy
  former shame, and shalt no more at all remember the reproach of thy
  widowhood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For it is the Lord that
  made thee; the Lord of hosts is his name: and he that delivered thee, he is
  the God of Israel, and shall be called so by the whole earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The Lord has not called thee as a deserted and
  faint-hearted woman, nor as a woman hated from her youth, saith thy God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For a little while I left thee: but
  with great mercy will I have compassion upon thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In a little wrath I turned away my face from thee;
  but with everlasting mercy will I have compassion upon thee, saith the Lord
  that delivers thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> From the time of
  the water of Noe this is my purpose: as I sware to him at that time, saying
  of the earth, I will no more be wroth with thee, neither when thou art
  threatened, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> shall the mountains
  depart, nor shall thy hills be removed: so neither shall my mercy fail thee,
  nor shall the covenant of thy peace be at all removed: for the Lord who is
  gracious to thee has spoken it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Afflicted and outcast thou has not been comforted: behold, I will prepare
  carbuncle for thy stones, and sapphire for thy foundations; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and I will make thy buttresses jasper, and thy
  gates crystal, and thy border precious stones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I will cause all thy sons to be taught of
  God, and thy children to be in great peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thou shalt be built in righteousness: abstain
  from injustice, and thou shalt not fear; and trembling shall not come nigh
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Behold, strangers shall come to
  thee by me, and shall sojourn with thee, and shall run to thee for refuge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Behold, I have created thee, not as
  the coppersmith blowing coals, and bringing out a vessel fit for work; but I
  have created thee, not for ruin, that I should destroy thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I will not suffer any weapon formed against thee
  to prosper; and every voice that shall rise up against thee for judgment,
  thou shalt vanquish them all; and thine adversaries shall be condemned
  thereby. There is an inheritance to them that serve the Lord, and ye shall be
  righteous before me, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah55">55</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Ye that thirst, go to the water,
  and all that have no money, go and buy; and eat and drink wine and fat
  without money or price. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Wherefore do
  ye value at the price of money, and give your labour for that which will not
  satisfy? hearken to me, and ye shall eat that which is good, and your soul
  shall feast itself on good things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Give heed with your ears, and follow my ways: hearken to me, and your soul
  shall live in prosperity; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
  the sure mercies of David. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Behold I
  have made him a testimony among the Gentiles, a prince and commander to the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Nations which know thee not,
  shall call upon thee, and peoples which are not acquainted with thee, shall
  flee to thee for refuge, for the sake of the Lord thy God, the Holy One of
  Israel; for he has glorified thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Seek ye the Lord, and when ye find him, call upon him; and when he shall draw
  nigh to you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> let the ungodly leave his
  ways, and the transgressor his counsels: and let him return to the Lord, and
  he shall find mercy; for he shall abundantly pardon your sins. <span style=

  my ways as your ways, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  But as the heaven is distant from the earth, so is my way distant from your
  ways, and your thoughts from my mind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  For as rain shall come down, or snow, from heaven, and shall not return until
  it have saturated the earth, and it bring forth, and bud, and give seed to
  the sower, and bread for food: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> so
  shall my word be, whatever shall proceed out of my mouth, it shall by no
  means turn back, until all the things which I willed shall have been
  accomplished; and I will make thy ways prosperous, and will effect my
  commands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For ye shall go forth with
  joy, and shall be taught with gladness: for the mountains and the hills shall
  exult to welcome you with joy, and all the trees of the field shall applaud
  with their branches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And instead of
  the bramble shall come up the cypress, and instead of the nettle shall come
  up the myrtle: and the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign,
  and shall not fail.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah56">56</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye

  be revealed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Blessed is the man that
  does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths
  from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let not the stranger who attaches
  himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people:
  and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as
  shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and
  take hold of my covenant; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I will give
  to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons
  and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will give it to the strangers
  that attach themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the
  Lord, to be to him servants and handmaids; and as for all that keep my
  sabbaths from profaning them, and that take hold of my covenant; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden
  them in my house of prayer: their whole-burnt-offerings and their sacrifices
  shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of
  prayer for all nations, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> saith the Lord
  that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a
  congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> All ye beasts of the
  field, come, devour, all ye beasts of the forest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> See how they are all blinded: they have not
  known; they are dumb dogs that will not bark; dreaming of rest, loving to
  slumber. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Yea, they are insatiable
  dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no

  <h3 id="isaiah57">57</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> See how the just man has perished,

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> His burial shall be in peace: he has
  been removed out of the way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But draw
  ye near hither, ye lawless children, the seed of adulterers and the harlot.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Wherein have ye been rioting? and
  against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye loosed your
  tongue? are ye not children of perdition? a lawless seed? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> who call upon idols under the leafy trees, slaying
  your children in the valleys among the rocks? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> That is thy portion, this is thy lot: and to them
  hast thou poured forth drink-offerings, and to these hast thou offered
  meat-offerings. Shall I not therefore be angry for these things? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> On a lofty and high mountain, there is thy bed,
  and thither thou carriedst up thy meat-offerings: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and behind the posts of thy door thou didst place
  thy memorials. Didst thou think that if thou shouldest depart from me, thou
  wouldest gain? thou hast loved those that lay with thee; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom with them,
  and thou hast increased the number of them that are far from thee, and hast
  sent ambassadors beyond thy borders, and hast been debased even to hell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou has wearied thyself with thy
  many ways; yet thou saidst not, I will cease to strengthen myself: for thou
  has done these things; therefore thou has not supplicated me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Through dread of whom hast thou feared, and lied
  against me, and has not remembered, nor considered me, nor regarded me, yea,
  though when I see thee I pass thee by, yet thou has not feared me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I will declare thy righteousness,
  and thy sins, which shall not profit thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in
  thine affliction: for all these the wind shall take, and the tempest shall
  carry them away: but they that cleave to me shall possess the land, and shall
  inherit my holy mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they
  shall say, Clear the ways before him, and take up the stumbling-blocks out of
  the way of my people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus saith the
  Most High, who dwells on high for ever, Holy in the holies, is his name, the
  Most High resting in the holies, and giving patience to the faint-hearted,
  and giving life to the broken-hearted: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I will not take vengeance on you for ever,
  neither will I be always angry with you: for my Spirit shall go forth from
  me, and I have created all breath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> On
  account of sin for a little while I grieved him, and smote him, and turned
  away my face from him; and he was grieved, and he went on sorrowful in his
  ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I have seen his ways, and
  healed him, and comforted him, and given him true comfort; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> peace upon peace to them that are far off, and to
  them that are nigh: and the Lord has said, I will heal them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But the unrighteous shall be tossed as troubled
  waves, and shall not be able to rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  There is no joy to the ungodly, said God.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah58">58</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up
  thy voice as with a trumpet, and declare to my people their sins, and to the
  house of Jacob their iniquities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> They
  seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways, as a people that had done
  righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of their God: they now ask
  of me righteous judgment, and desire to draw nigh to God, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> saying, Why have we fasted, and thou regardest
  not? why have we afflicted our souls, and thou didst not know it?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If ye fast for quarrels and strifes,
  and smite the lowly with your fists, wherefore do ye fast to me as ye do this
  day, so that your voice may be heard in crying? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I have not chosen this fast, nor such a day for a
  man to afflict his soul; neither though thou shouldest bend down thy neck as
  a ring, and spread under thee sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall ye call
  a fast acceptable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I have not chosen
  such a fast, saith the Lord; but do thou loose every burden of iniquity, do
  thou untie the knots of hard bargains, set the bruised free, and cancel every
  unjust account. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Break thy bread to the
  hungry, and lead the unsheltered poor to thy house: if thou seest one naked,
  clothe him, and thou shalt not disregard the relations of thine own seed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then shall thy light break forth as
  the morning, and thy health shall speedily spring forth: and thy
  righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall compass thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then shalt thou cry, and God shall
  hearken to thee; while thou art yet speaking he will say, Behold, I am here.
  If thou remove from thee the band, and the stretching forth of the hands, and
  murmuring speech; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and if thou give
  bread to the hungry from thy heart, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then
  shall thy light spring up in darkness, and thy darkness shall be as noon-day:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and thy God shall be with thee
  continually, and thou shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desires; and
  thy bones shall be made fat, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as a
  fountain from which the water has not failed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thy old waste desert places shall be built
  up, and thy foundations shall last through all generations; and thou shalt be
  called a repairer of breaches, and thou shalt cause thy paths between to be
  in peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> If thou turn away thy foot
  from the sabbath, so as not to do thy pleasure on the holy days, and shalt
  call the sabbaths delightful, holy to God; if thou shalt not lift up thy foot
  to work, nor speak a word in anger out of thy mouth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> then shalt thou trust on the Lord; and he shall
  bring thee up to the good places of the land, and feed thee with the heritage
  of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah59">59</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Has the hand of the Lord no power
  to save? or has he made his ear heavy, so that he should not hear?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Nay, your iniquities separate between
  you and God, and because of your sins has he turned away his face from you,
  so as not to have mercy upon you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with sins; your lips also
  have spoken iniquity, and your tongue meditates unrighteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> None speaks justly, neither is there true
  judgment: they trust in vanities, and speak empty words; for they conceive
  trouble, and bring forth iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  They have hatched aspsâ€™ eggs, and weave a spiderâ€™s web: and he that is going
  to eat of their eggs, having crushed an addled egg, has found also in it a
  basilisk. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Their web shall not become a
  garment, nor shall they at all clothe themselves with their works; for their
  works are works of iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And their
  feet run to wickedness, swift to shed blood; their thoughts also are thoughts
  of murder; destruction and misery are in their ways; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and the way of peace they know not, neither is
  there judgment in their ways; for their paths by which they go are crooked,
  and they know not peace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore has
  judgment departed from them, and righteousness shall not overtake them: while
  they waited for light, darkness came upon them; while they waited for
  brightness, they walked in perplexity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They shall feel for the wall as blind men, and
  shall feel for it as if they had no eyes: and they shall feel at noon-day as
  at midnight; they shall groan as dying men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They shall proceed together as a bear and as a
  dove: we have waited for judgment, and there is no salvation, it is gone far
  from us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For our iniquity is great
  before thee, and our sins have risen up against us: for our iniquities are in
  us, and we know our unrighteous deeds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> We have sinned, and dealt falsely, and revolted
  from our God: we have spoken unrighteous words, and have been disobedient; we
  have conceived and uttered from our heart unrighteous words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And we have turned judgment back, and
  righteousness has departed afar off: for truth is consumed in their ways, and
  they could not pass by a straight path. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And truth has been taken away, and they have
  turned aside their mind from understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he looked, and there was no man, and he
  observed, and there was none to help: so he defended them with his arm, and
  stablished them with his mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And
  he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and placed the helmet of salvation
  on his head; and he clothed himself with the garment of vengeance, and with
  his cloak, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> as one about to render a
  recompence, even reproach to his adversaries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> So shall they of the west fear the name of the
  Lord, and they that come from the rising of the sun his glorious name: for
  the wrath of the Lord shall come as a mighty river, it shall come with fury.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the deliverer shall come for Sionâ€™
   s sake, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And this shall be my covenant with them, said the
  Lord; My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy
  mouth, shall never fail from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, for
  the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever.</p>

  glorified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And strangers shall build
  thy walls, and their kings shall wait upon thee: for by reason of my wrath I
  smote thee, and by reason of mercy I loved thee. <span style=

  shall not be shut day nor night; to bring in to thee the power of the
  Gentiles, and their kings as captives. <span style=

  to thee, with the cypress, and pine, and cedar together, to glorify my holy
  place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the sons of them that
  afflicted thee, and of them that provoked thee, shall come to thee in fear;
  and thou shalt be called Sion, the city of the Holy One of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because thou has become desolate and
  hated, and there was no helper, therefore I will make thee a perpetual
  gladness, a joy of many generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt eat the wealth of
  kings: and shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and delivers thee,
  the Holy One of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And for brass
  I will bring thee gold, and for iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of
  wood I will bring thee brass, and instead of stones, iron; and I will make
  thy princes peaceable, and thine overseers righteous. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and they shall greatly rejoice in the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And as the earth putting forth
  her flowers, and as a garden its seed; so shall the Lord, even the Lord,
  cause righteousness to spring forth, and exultation before all nations.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah62">62</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For Sionâ€™s sake I will not hold my
  peace, and for Jerusalemâ€™s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go
  forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and
  kings thy glory: and one shall call thee by a new name, which the Lord shall
  name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And thou shalt be a crown of
  beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou shalt no more be called
  Forsaken; and thy land shall no more be called Desert: for thou shalt be
  called My Pleasure, and thy land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure
  in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall
  thy sons dwell in thee: and it shall come to pass that as a bridegroom will
  rejoice over a bride, so will the Lord rejoice over thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And on thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen
  all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For there is none like you, when he
  shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the Lord has sworn by his glory,
  and by the might of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy provisions
  to thine enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink thy wine, for which thou
  has laboured. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But they that have
  gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that
  have gathered the grapes shall drink thereof in my holy courts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Go through my gates, and make a way for my
  people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For behold, the Lord has
  proclaimed to the end of the earth, say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold,
  thy Saviour has come to thee, having his reward and his work before his face.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And one shall call them the holy
  people, the redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called a city sought out,
  and not forsaken.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah63">63</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Who is this that is come from Edom,
  with red garments from Bosor? thus fair in his apparel, with mighty strength?
  I speak of righteousness and saving judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as
  if fresh from a trodden winepress? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I
  am full of trodden grape, and of the nations there is not a man with me; and
  I trampled them in my fury, and dashed them to pieces as earth, and brought
  down their blood to the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For the
  day of recompence has come upon them, and the year of redemption is at hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I looked, and there was no helper;
  and I observed, and none upheld: therefore my arm delivered them, and mine
  anger drew nigh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I trampled them
  in mine anger, and brought down their blood to the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I remembered the mercy of the Lord, the praises of
  the Lord in all things wherein he recompenses us. The Lord is a good judge to
  the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy, and according
  to the abundance of his righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And he said, Is it not my people? the children surely will not be rebellious:
  and he became to them deliverance <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> out
  of all their affliction: not an ambassador, nor a messenger, but himself
  saved them, because he loved them and spared them: he himself redeemed them,
  and took them up, and lifted them up all the days of old. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But they disobeyed, and provoked his Holy Spirit:
  so he turned to be an enemy, he himself contended against them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then he remembered the ancient days, saying,
  Where is he that brought up from the sea the shepherd of the sheep? where is
  he that put his Holy Spirit in them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  who led Moses with his right hand, the arm of his glory? he forced the water
  to separate from before him, to make himself an everlasting name.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He led them through the deep, as a
  horse through the wilderness, and they fainted not, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and as cattle through a plain: the Spirit came
  down from the Lord, and guided them: thus thou leddest thy people, to make
  thyself a glorious name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Turn from
  heaven, and look from thy holy habitation and from thy glory: where is thy
  zeal and thy strength? where is the abundance of thy mercy and of thy
  compassions, that thou hast withholden thyself from us? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For thou art our Father; for though Abraham knew
  us not, and Israel did not acknowledge us, yet do thou, O Lord, our Father,
  deliver us: thy name has been upon us from the beginning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Why hast thou caused us to err, O Lord, from thy
  way? and has hardened our hearts, that we should not fear thee? Return for
  thy servantsâ€™ sake, for the sake of the tribes of thine inheritance,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> that we may inherit a small part of
  thy holy mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> We are become as
  at the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and thy name was not
  called upon us.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah64">64</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> If thou wouldest open the heaven,
  trembling will take hold upon the mountains from thee, and they shall melt,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> as wax melts before the fire; and fire
  shall burn up the enemies, and thy name shall be manifest among the
  adversaries: at thy presence the nations shall be troubled, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> whenever thou shalt work gloriously; trembling
  from thee shall take hold upon the mountains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> From of old we have not heard, neither have our
  eyes seen a God beside thee, and thy works which thou wilt perform to them
  that wait for mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For these
  blessings shall happen to them that work righteousness, and they shall
  remember thy ways: behold, thou wast angry and we have sinned; therefore we
  have erred, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and we are all become as
  unclean, and all our righteousness as a filthy rag: and we have fallen as
  leaves because of our iniquities; thus the wind shall carry us away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there is none that calls upon thy
  name, or that remembers to take hold on thee: for thou hast turned thy face
  away from us, and hast delivered us up because of our sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And now, O Lord, thou art our Father, and we are
  clay, all of us the work of thine hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Be not very wroth with us, and remember not our
  sins for ever; but now look on us, for we are all thy people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The city of thy holiness has become desolate,
  Sion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The house, our sanctuary, and the glory which our
  fathers blessed, has been burnt with fire: and all our glorious things have
  gone to ruin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And for all these
  things thou, O Lord, has withholden, thyself, and been silent, and hast
  brought us very low.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah65">65</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I became manifest to them that
  asked not for me; I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold, I
  am here, to a nation, who called not on my name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I have stretched forth my hands all day to a
  disobedient and gainsaying people, to them that walked in a way that was not
  good, but after their sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> This is
  the people that provokes me continually in my presence; they offer sacrifices
  in gardens, and burn incense on bricks to devils, which exist not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They lie down to sleep in the tombs
  and in the caves for the sake of dreams, even they that eat swineâ€™s flesh,
  and the broth of their sacrifices: all their vessels are defiled:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> who say, Depart from me, draw not nigh
  to me, for I am pure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Behold, it is
  written before me: I will not be silent until I have recompensed into their
  bosom, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> their sins and the sins of
  their fathers, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense on the mountains, and
  reproached me on the hills: I will recompense their works into their bosom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thus saith the Lord, As a grape-stone
  shall be found in the cluster, and they shall say, Destroy it not; for a
  blessing is in it: so will I do for the sake of him that serves me, for his
  sake I will not destroy them all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  I will lead forth the seed that came of Jacob and of Juda, and they shall
  inherit my holy mountain: and mine elect and my servants shall inherit it,
  and shall dwell there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there
  shall be in the forest folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor shall be for
  a resting-place of herds for my people, who have sought me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But ye are they that have left me, and forget my
  holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up the
  drink-offering to Fortune. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I will
  deliver you up to the sword, ye shall all fall by slaughter: for I called
  you, and ye hearkened not; I spoke, and ye refused to hear; and ye did evil
  in my sight, and chose the things wherein I delighted not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my
  servants shall eat, but ye shall hunger: behold, my servants shall drink, but
  ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> behold, my servants shall exult with
  joy, but ye shall cry for the sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for the
  vexation of your spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For ye shall
  leave your name for a loathing to my chosen, and the Lord shall destroy you:
  but my servants shall be called by a new name, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> which shall be blessed on the earth; for they
  shall bless the true God: and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by
  the true God; for they shall forget the former affliction, it shall not come
  into their mind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For there shall be a
  new heaven and a new earth: and they shall not at all remember the former,
  neither shall they at all come into their mind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But they shall find in her joy and exultation;
  for, behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and will be glad
  in my people: and there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping,
  or the voice of crying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Neither shall
  there be there any more a child that dies untimely, or an old man who shall
  not complete his time: for the youth shall be a hundred years old, and the
  sinner who dies at a hundred years shall also be accursed: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and they shall build houses, and themselves shall
  dwell in them; and they shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the
  fruit thereof. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> They shall by no means
  build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat:
  for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they
  shall long enjoy the fruits of their labours. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall
  they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and
  their offspring with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And it
  shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hearken to them; while they
  are yet speaking, I will say, What is it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then wolves and lambs shall feed together, and
  the lion shall eat chaff like the ox, and the serpent earth as bread. They
  shall not injure nor destroy in my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="isaiah66">66</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my
  throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will ye build me?
  and of what kind is to be the place of my rest? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For all these things are mine, saith the Lord: and
  to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the man that
  trembles at my words? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But the
  transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he
  that offers fine flour, as one that offers swineâ€™s blood; he that gives
  frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I also will choose their mockeries, and will
  recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not
  hearken to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and
  chose the things wherein I delighted not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Hear the words of the Lord, ye that tremble at his
  word; speak ye, our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that
  the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear their joy; but they
  shall be ashamed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> A voice of a cry
  from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering
  recompence to his adversaries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Before
  she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she
  escaped it and brought forth a male. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth
  travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has
  travailed, and brought forth her children? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But I have raised this expectation, yet thou hast
  not remembered me, saith the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and
  barren woman? saith thy God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Rejoice,
  O Jerusalem, and all ye that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice
  greatly with her, all that now mourn over her: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the
  breast of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves with
  the influx of her glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For thus
  saith the Lord, Behold, I turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a
  torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their
  children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> As if his mother should comfort one,
  so will I also comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye shall see, and your heart
  shall rejoice, and your bones shall thrive like grass: and the hand of the
  Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the
  disobedient. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For, behold, the Lord
  will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with
  wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall
  be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They that sanctify themselves and
  purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swineâ€™s flesh in the porches, and
  the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I know their works and their
  imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall
  come, and see my glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will
  leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them
  to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and
  to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name,
  nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And they shall bring your brethren
  out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in
  litters drawn by mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the
  Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me
  with psalms into the house of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I will take of them priests and Levites,
  saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For as the new heaven
  and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall
  your seed and your name continue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, that
  all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they shall go forth, and see the
  carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall
  not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle
  to all flesh.</p>
