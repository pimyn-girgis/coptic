  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord called Moses again and
  spoke to him out of the tabernacle of witness, saying, Speak to the children
  of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  If any man of you shall bring gifts to the Lord, ye shall bring your gifts of
  the cattle and of the oxen and of the sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> If his gift be a whole-burnt-offering, he shall
  bring an unblemished male of the herd to the door of the tabernacle of
  witness, he shall bring it as acceptable before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the
  burnt-offering as a thing acceptable for him, to make atonement for him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they shall slay the calf before
  the Lord; and the sons of Aaron the priests shall bring the blood, and they
  shall pour the blood round about on the altar, which is at the doors of the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And having
  flayed the whole burnt-offering, they shall divide it by its limbs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the sons of Aaron the priests
  shall put fire on the altar, and shall pile wood on the fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the sons of Aaron the priests shall pile up
  the divided parts, and the head, and the fat on the wood on the fire, the
  wood which is on the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the
  entrails and the feet they shall wash in water, and the priests shall put all
  on the altar: it is a burnt-offering, a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And if his gift be of the
  sheep to the Lord, or of the lambs, or of the kids for whole-burnt-offerings,
  he shall bring it a male without blemish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he shall lay his hand on its head; and they
  shall kill it by the side of the altar, toward the north before the Lord, and
  the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour its blood on the altar round about.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they shall divide it by its
  limbs, and its head and its fat, and the priests shall pile them up on the
  wood which is on the fire, on the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they shall wash the entrails and the feet
  with water, and the priest shall bring all the parts and put them on the
  altar: it is a burnt-offering, a sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if he bring his gift, a
  burnt-offering to the Lord, of birds, then shall he bring his gift of doves
  or pigeons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the priest shall
  bring it to the altar, and shall wring off its head; and the priest shall put
  it on the altar, and shall wring out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he shall take away the crop with
  the feathers, and shall cast it forth by the altar toward the east to the
  place of the ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he shall
  break it off from the wings and shall not separate it, and the priest shall
  put it on the altar on the wood which is on the fire: it is a burnt-offering,
  a sacrifice, a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And if a soul bring a gift, a
  sacrifice to the Lord, his gift shall be fine flour; and he shall pour oil
  upon it, and shall put frankincense on it: it is a sacrifice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he shall bring it to the priests the sons of
  Aaron: and having taken from it a handful of the fine flour with the oil, and
  all its frankincense, then the priest shall put the memorial of it on the
  altar: it is a sacrifice, an odour of sweet savour to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the remainder of the sacrifice shall be for
  Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion from the sacrifices of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if he bring as a gift a sacrifice
  baked from the oven, a gift to the Lord of fine flour, he shall bring
  unleavened bread kneaded with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And if thy gift be a sacrifice from a
  pan, it is fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened offerings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou shalt break them into fragments and pour
  oil upon them: it is a sacrifice to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if thy gift be a sacrifice from the hearth, it
  shall be made of fine flour with oil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And he shall offer the sacrifice which he shall make of these to the Lord,
  and shall bring it to the priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  the priest shall approach the altar, and shall take away from the sacrifice a
  memorial of it, and the priest shall place it on the altar: a burnt offering,
  a smell of sweet savour to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And that which is left of the sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons, most
  holy from the burnt-offerings of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ye shall not leaven any sacrifice which ye shall
  bring to the Lord; for as to any leaven, or any honey, ye shall not bring of
  it to offer a gift to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ye
  shall bring them in the way of fruits to the Lord, but they shall not be
  offered on the altar for a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And every gift of your sacrifice shall be
  seasoned with salt; omit not the salt of the covenant of the Lord from your
  sacrifices: on every gift of yours ye shall offer salt to the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if thou wouldest offer a
  sacrifice of first-fruits to the Lord, it shall be new grains ground and
  roasted for the Lord; so shalt thou bring the sacrifice of the first-fruits.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And thou shalt pour oil upon it, and
  shalt put frankincense on it: it is a sacrifice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the priest shall offer the memorial of it
  taken from the grains with the oil, and all its frankincense: it is a
  burnt-offering to the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And if his gift to the Lord be a
  peace-offering, if he should bring it of the oxen, whether it be male or
  whether it be female, he shall bring it unblemished before the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he shall lay his hands on the head
  of the gift, and shall slay it before the Lord, by the doors of the
  tabernacle of witness. And the priests the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood
  on the altar of burnt-offerings round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they shall bring of the peace-offering a
  burnt-sacrifice to the Lord, the fat covering the belly, and all the fat on
  the belly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the two kidneys and the
  fat that is upon them; he shall take away that which is on the thighs, and
  the caul above the liver together with the kidneys. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer them
  on the altar on the burnt-offering, on the wood which is on the fire upon the
  altar: it is a burnt-offering, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if his gift be of the sheep, a
  peace-offering to the Lord, male or female, he shall bring it unblemished.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> If he bring a lamb for his gift, he
  shall bring it before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he
  shall lay his hands on the head of his offering, and shall slay it by the
  doors of the tabernacle of witness; and the priests the sons of Aaron shall
  pour out the blood on the altar round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he shall bring of the peace-offering a
  burnt-sacrifice to the Lord: the fat and the hinder part unblemished he shall
  take away with the loins, and having taken away all the fat that covers the
  belly, and all the fat that is on the belly, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and both the kidneys and the fat that is upon
  them, and that which is on the thighs, and the caul which is on the liver
  with the kidneys, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> the priest shall
  offer these on the altar: it is a sacrifice of sweet savour, a burnt-offering
  to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And if his offering be
  of the goats, then shall he bring it before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall lay his hands on its head; and they
  shall slay it before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of witness; and
  the priests the sons of Aaron shall pour out the blood on the altar round
  about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he shall offer of it a
  burnt-offering to the Lord, even the fat that covers the belly, and all the
  fat that is on the belly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And both
  the kidneys, and all the fat that is upon them, that which is upon the
  thighs, and the caul of the liver with the kidneys, shall he take away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the priest shall offer it upon
  the altar: it is a burnt-offering, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord. All
  the fat belongs to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> It is a
  perpetual statute throughout your generations, in all your habitations; ye
  shall eat no fat and no blood.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the children of
  Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin unwillingly before the Lord, in any of
  the commandments of the Lord concerning things which he ought not to do, and
  shall do some of them; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> if the anointed
  priest sin so as to cause the people to sin, then shall he bring for his sin,
  which he has sinned, an unblemished calf of the herd to the Lord for his sin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he shall bring the calf to the
  door of the tabernacle of witness before the Lord, and he shall put his hand
  on the head of the calf before the Lord, and shall slay the calf in the
  presence of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the anointed
  priest who has been consecrated having received of the blood of the calf,
  shall then bring it into the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the priest shall dip his finger into the
  blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, over against
  the holy veil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the priest shall
  put of the blood of the calf on the horns of the altar of the compound
  incense which is before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of witness; and
  all the blood of the calf shall he pour out by the foot of the altar of
  whole-burnt-offerings, which is by the doors of the tabernacle of witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and all the fat of the calf of the
  sin-offering shall he take off from it; the fat that covers the inwards, and
  all the fat that is on the inwards, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is on the thighs,
  and the caul that is on the liver with the kidneys, them shall he take away,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> as he takes it away from the calf of
  the sacrifice of peace-offering, so shall the priest offer it on the altar of
  burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they shall take
  the skin of the calf, and all his flesh with the head and the extremities and
  the belly and the dung, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and they
  shall carry out the whole calf out of the camp into a clean place, where they
  pour out the ashes, and they shall consume it there on wood with fire: it
  shall be burnt on the ashes poured out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if the whole congregation of Israel trespass
  ignorantly, and a thing should escape the notice of the congregation, and
  they should do one thing forbidden of any of the commands of the Lord, which
  ought not to be done, and should transgress: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and the sin wherein they have sinned should
  become known to them, then shall the congregation bring an unblemished calf
  of the herd for a sin-offering, and they shall bring it to the doors of the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the elders
  of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the calf before the
  Lord, and they shall slay the calf before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the anointed priest shall bring in of the
  blood of the calf into the tabernacle of witness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the priest shall dip his finger into some of
  the blood of the calf, and shall sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in
  front of the veil of the sanctuary. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of the
  incense of composition, which is before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle
  of witness; and he shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of
  whole-burnt-offerings, which is by the door of the tabernacle of witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he shall take away all the fat
  from it, and shall offer it up on the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he shall do to the calf as he did to the calf
  of the sin-offering, so shall it be done; and the priest shall make atonement
  for them, and the trespass shall be forgiven them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they shall carry forth the calf whole without
  the camp, and they shall burn the calf as they burnt the former calf: it is
  the sin-offering of the congregation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And if a ruler sin, and break one of all the commands of the Lord his God,
  doing the thing which ought not to be done, unwillingly, and shall sin and
  trespass, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and his trespass wherein he
  has sinned, be known to him, then shall he offer for his gift a kid of the
  goats, a male without blemish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he
  shall lay his hand on the head of the kid, and they shall kill it in the
  place where they kill the victims for whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord;
  it is a sin-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the priest
  shall put some of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger on the horns
  of the altar of whole-burnt-offering; and he shall pour out all its blood by
  the bottom of the altar of whole-burnt-offerings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he shall offer up all his fat on the altar,
  as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall make
  atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if a soul of the people of the
  land should sin unwillingly, in doing a thing contrary to any of the
  commandments of the Lord, which ought not to be done, and shall transgress,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and his sin should be known to him,
  wherein he has sinned, then shall he bring a kid of the goats, a female
  without blemish shall he bring for his sin, which he has sinned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of his
  sin-offering, and they shall slay the kid of the sin-offering in the place
  where they slay the victims for whole-burnt-offerings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And the priest shall take of its blood with his
  finger, and shall put it on the horns of the altar of whole-burnt-offerings;
  and all its blood he shall pour forth by the foot of the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he shall take away all the fat, as the fat is
  taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offering, and the priest shall offer
  it on the altar for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord; and the priest shall
  make atonement for him, and his sin shall be forgiven him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And if he should offer a lamb for his
  sin-offering, he shall offer it a female without blemish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the
  sin-offerings, and they shall kill it in the place where they kill the
  victims for whole-burnt-offerings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger,
  and shall put it on the horns of the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, and he
  shall pour out all its blood by the bottom of the altar of
  whole-burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he shall
  take away all his fat, as the fat of the lamb of the sacrifice of
  peace-offering is taken away, and the priest shall put it on the altar for a
  whole-burnt-offering to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him
  for the sin which he sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And if a soul sin, and hear the
  voice of swearing, and he is a witness or has seen or been conscious, if he
  do not report it, he shall bear his iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> That soul which shall touch any unclean thing, or
  carcase, or that which is unclean being taken of beasts, or the dead bodies
  of abominable reptiles which are unclean, or carcases of unclean cattle,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> or should touch the uncleanness of a
  man, or whatever kind, which he may touch and be defiled by, and it should
  have escaped him, but afterwards he should know, —then he shall have
  transgressed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> That unrighteous soul,
  which determines with his lips to do evil or to do good according to
  whatsoever a man may determine with an oath, and it shall have escaped his
  notice, and he shall afterwards know it, and so he should sin in some one of
  these things: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> —then shall he declare
  his sin in the tings wherein he has sinned by that sin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he shall bring for his transgressions against
  the Lord, for his sin which he has sinned, a ewe lamb of the flock, or a kid
  of the goats, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
  him for his sin which he has sinned, and his sin shall be forgiven him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if he cannot afford a sheep, he
  shall bring for his sin which he has sinned, two turtle-doves or two young
  pigeons to the Lord; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a
  burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he shall bring
  them to the priest, and the priest shall bring the sin-offering first; and
  the priest shall pinch off the head from the neck, and shall not divide the
  body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he shall sprinkle of the
  blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar, but the rest of the blood
  he shall drop at the foot of the altar, for it is a sin-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he shall make the second a
  whole-burnt-offering, as it is fit; and the priest shall make atonement for
  his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And if he cannot afford a pair of turtle-doves,
  or two young pigeons, then shall he bring as his gift for his sin, the tenth
  part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall not pour oil upon
  it, nor shall he put frankincense upon it, because it is a sin-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he shall bring it to the priest;
  and the priest having taken a handful of it, shall lay the memorial of it on
  the altar of whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord; it is a sin-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the priest shall make atonement
  for him for his sin, which he has sinned in one of these things, and it shall
  be forgiven him; and that which is left shall be the priest’s, as an offering
  of fine flour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord spoke to
  Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The soul which shall
  be really unconscious, and shall sin unwillingly in any of the holy things of
  the Lord, shall even bring to the Lord for his transgression, a ram of the
  flock without blemish, valued according to shekels of silver according to the
  shekel of the sanctuary, for his transgression wherein he transgressed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he shall make compensation for
  that wherein he has sinned in the holy things; and he shall add the fifth
  part to it, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement
  for him with the ram of transgression, and his sin shall be forgiven him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the soul which shall sin, and do
  one thing against any of the commandments of the Lord, which it is not right
  to do, and has not known it, and shall have transgressed, and shall have
  contracted guilt, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> he shall even bring
  a ram without blemish from the flock, valued at a price of silver for his
  transgression to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for his
  trespass of ignorance, wherein he ignorantly trespassed, and he knew it not;
  and it shall be forgiven him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For he
  has surely been guilty of transgression before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6:1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:2)</span> The soul which shall have sinned,
  and willfully overlooked the commandments of the Lord, and shall have dealt
  falsely in the affairs of his neighbour in the matter of a deposit, or
  concerning fellowship, or concerning plunder, or has in anything wronged his
  neighbour, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:3)</span> or has found that which
  was lost, and shall have lied concerning it, and shall have sworn unjustly
  concerning any one of all the things, whatsoever a man may do, so as to sin
  hereby; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:4)</span> it shall come to pass,
  whensoever he shall have sinned, and transgressed, that he shall restore the
  plunder which he has seized, or redress the injury which he has committed, or
  restore the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost article which he
  has found of any kind, about which he swore unjustly, he shall even restore
  it in full; and he shall add to it a fifth part besides; he shall restore it
  to him whose it is in the day in which he happens to be convicted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:5)</span> And he shall bring to the Lord for
  his trespass, a ram of the flock, without blemish, of value to the amount of
  the thing in which he trespassed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:6)</span>
  And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and he shall be
  forgiven for any one of all the things which he did and trespassed in it.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Charge Aaron and his sons,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> This is the law of
  whole-burnt-offering; this is the whole-burnt-offering in its burning on the
  altar all the night till the morning; and the fire of the altar shall burn on
  it, it shall not be put out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the
  priest shall put on the linen tunic, and he shall put the linen drawers on
  his body; and shall take away that which has been thoroughly burnt, which the
  fire shall have consumed, even the whole-burnt-offering from the altar, and
  he shall put it near the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  he shall put off his robe, and put on another robe, and he shall take forth
  the offering that has been burnt without the camp into a clean place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the fire on the altar shall be
  kept burning on it, and shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall burn
  on it wood every morning, and shall heap on it the whole-burnt-offering, and
  shall lay on it the fat of the peace-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the fire shall always burn on the altar; it
  shall not be extinguished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> This is
  the law of the sacrifice, which the sons of Aaron shall bring near before the
  Lord, before the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he shall
  take from it a handful of the fine flour of the sacrifice with its oil, and
  with all its frankincense, which are upon the sacrifice; and he shall offer
  up on the altar a burnt-offering as a sweet-smelling savour, a memorial of it
  to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Aaron and his sons
  shall eat that which is left of it: it shall be eaten without leaven in a
  holy place, they shall eat it in the court of the tabernacle of witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> It shall not be baked with leaven. I
  have given it as a portion to them of the burnt-offerings of the Lord: it is
  most holy, as the offering for sin, and as the offering for trespass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Every male of the priests shall eat
  it: it is a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations of the
  burnt-offerings of the Lord; whosoever shall touch them shall be hallowed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> This is the gift of Aaron and of his
  sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day in which thou shalt
  anoint him; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sacrifice continually,
  the half of it in the morning, and the half of it in the evening.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It shall be made with oil in a
  frying-pan; he shall offer it kneaded and in rolls, an offering of fragments,
  an offering of a sweet savour unto the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The anointed priest who is in his place, one of
  his sons, shall offer it: it is a perpetual statute, it shall all be
  consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And every sacrifice of a
  priest shall be thoroughly burnt, and shall not be eaten. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is
  the law of the sin-offering; —in the place where they slay the
  whole-burnt-offering, they shall slay the sin-offerings before the Lord: they
  are most holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The priest that offers
  it shall eat it: in a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the
  tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Every one that
  touches the flesh of it shall be holy, and on whosesoever garment any of its
  blood shall have been sprinkled, whosoever shall have it sprinkled, shall be
  washed in the holy place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the
  earthen vessel, in whichsoever it shall have been sodden, shall be broken;
  and if it shall have been sodden in a brazen vessel, he shall scour it and
  wash it with water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Every male among
  the priests shall eat it: it is most holy to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And no offerings for sin, of whose blood there
  shall be brought any into the tabernacle of witness to make atonement in the
  holy place, shall be eaten: they shall be burned with fire.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(6:31)</span> And this is the law of the ram
  for the trespass-offering; it is most holy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6:32)</span> In the place where they slay the
  whole-burnt-offering, they shall slay the ram of the trespass-offering before
  the Lord, and he shall pour out the blood at the bottom of the altar round
  about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:33)</span> And he shall offer all the
  fat from it; and the loins, and all the fat that covers the inwards, and all
  the fat that is upon the inwards, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:34)</span>
  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, that which is upon the
  thighs, and the caul upon the liver with the kidney, he shall take them away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:35)</span> And the priest shall offer them on
  the altar a burnt-offering to the Lord; it is for trespass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6:36)</span> Every male of the priest shall eat them, in the
  holy place they shall eat them: they are most holy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6:37)</span> As the sin-offering, so also is the
  trespass-offering. There is one law of them; the priest who shall make
  atonement with it, his it shall be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:38)</span>
  And as for the priest who offers a man’s whole-burnt-offering, the skin of
  the whole-burnt-offering which he offers, shall be his. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6:39)</span> And every sacrifice which shall be prepared in
  the oven, and every one which shall be prepared on the hearth, or on a
  frying-pan, it is the property of the priest that offers it; it shall be his.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6:40)</span> And every sacrifice made up with
  oil, or not made up with oil, shall belong to the sons of Aaron, an equal
  portion to each. <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> This is the law of
  the sacrifice of peace-offering, which they shall bring to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> If a man should offer it for praise,
  then shall he bring, for the sacrifice of praise, loaves of fine flour made
  up with oil, and unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and fine flour kneaded
  with oil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> With leavened bread he shall
  offer his gifts, with the peace-offering of praise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he shall bring one of all his gifts, a
  separate offering to the Lord: it shall belong to the priest who pours forth
  the blood of the peace-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offering of praise shall be his, and
  it shall be eaten in the day in which it is offered: they shall not leave of
  it till the morning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if it be a
  vow, or he offer his gift of his own will, on whatsoever day he shall offer
  his sacrifice, it shall be eaten, and on the morrow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And that which is left of the flesh of the
  sacrifice till the third day, shall be consumed with fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if he do at all eat of the flesh on the third
  day, it shall not be accepted for him that offers: it shall not be reckoned
  to him, it is pollution; and whatsoever soul shall eat of it, shall bear his
  iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And whatsoever flesh shall
  have touched any unclean thing, it shall not be eaten, it shall be consumed
  with fire; every one that is clean shall eat the flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And whatsoever soul shall eat of the flesh of the
  sacrifice of the peace-offering which is the Lord’s, and his uncleanness be
  upon him, that soul shall perish from his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And whatsoever soul shall touch any unclean
  thing, either of the uncleanness of a man, or of unclean quadrupeds, or any
  unclean abominable thing, and shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of the
  peace-offering, which is the Lord’s, that soul shall perish from his people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Speak to the children of Israel,
  saying, Ye shall eat no fat of oxen or sheep or goats. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the fat of such animals as have died of
  themselves, or have been seized of beasts, may be employed for any work; but
  it shall not be eaten for food. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Every
  one that eats fat off the beasts, from which he will bring a burnt-offering
  to the Lord—that soul shall perish from his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Ye shall eat no blood in all your habitations,
  either of beasts or of birds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Every
  soul that shall eat blood, that soul shall perish from his people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou shalt also speak to the children
  of Israel, saying, He that offers a sacrifice of peace-offering, shall bring
  his gift to the Lord also from the sacrifice of peace-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> His hands shall bring the burnt-offerings to the
  Lord; the fat which is on the breast and the lobe of the liver, he shall
  bring them, so as to set them for a gift before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the priest shall offer the fat upon the
  altar, and the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and ye shall give the right shoulder for a choice
  piece to the priest of your sacrifices of peace-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He that offers the blood of the peace-offering,
  and the fat, of the sons of Aaron, his shall be the right shoulder for a
  portion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For I have taken the
  wave-breast and shoulder of separation from the children of Israel from the
  sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest
  and his sons, a perpetual ordinance due from the children of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> This is the anointing of Aaron, and
  the anointing of his sons, their portion of the burnt-offerings of the Lord,
  in the day in which he brought them forward to minister as priests to the
  Lord; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> as the Lord commanded to give
  to them in the day in which he anointed them of the sons of Israel, a
  perpetual statute through their generations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> This is the law of the whole-burnt-offerings, and
  of sacrifice, and of sin-offering, and of offering for transgression, and of
  the sacrifice of consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offering;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> as the Lord commanded Moses in the
  mount Sina, in the day in which he commanded the children of Israel to offer
  their gifts before the Lord in the wilderness of Sina.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Take Aaron and his sons, and
  his robes and the anointing oil, and the calf for the sin-offering, and the
  two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and assemble the whole congregation at the door of
  the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moses
  did as the Lord appointed him, and he assembled the congregation at the door
  of the tabernacle of witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord has
  commanded you to do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses brought
  nigh Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and put on him the coat, and girded him with the
  girdle, and clothed him with the tunic, and put on him the ephod;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and girded him with a girdle according
  to the make of the ephod, and clasped him closely with it: and put upon it
  the oracle, and put upon the oracle the Manifestation and the Truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he put the mitre on his head, and
  put upon the mitre in front the golden plate, the most holy thing, as the
  Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Moses took
  of the anointing oil, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and sprinkled
  of it seven times on the altar; and anointed the altar, and hallowed it, and
  all things on it, and the laver, and its foot, and sanctified them; and
  anointed the tabernacle and all its furniture, and hallowed it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Moses poured of the anointing oil on the head
  of Aaron; and he anointed him and sanctified him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Moses brought the sons of Aaron near, and put
  on them coast and girded them with girdles, and put on them bonnets, as the
  Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Moses
  brought near the calf for the sin-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their
  hands on the head of the calf of the sin-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood, and
  put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger; and he purified
  the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar, and
  sanctified it, to make atonement upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Moses took all the fat that was upon the
  inwards, and the lobe on the liver, and both the kidneys, and the fat that
  was upon them, and Moses offered them on the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But the calf, and his hide, and his flesh, and
  his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Moses brought near the ram for a
  whole-burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of
  the ram. And Moses slew the ram: and Moses poured the blood on the altar
  round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he divided the ram
  by its limbs, and Moses offered the head, and the limbs, and the fat; and he
  washed the belly and the feet with water.<span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Moses offered up the whole ram on the altar:
  it is a whole-burnt-offering for a sweet-smelling savour; it is a
  burnt-offering to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Moses brought the second ram, the ram of
  consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
  and he slew him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and Moses took of
  his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of
  his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron; and
  Moses put of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of
  their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet, and Moses
  poured out the blood on the altar round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he took the fat, and the rump, and the fat on
  the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that
  is upon them, and the right shoulder. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And from the basket of consecration, which was before the Lord, he also took
  one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one cake; and put them
  upon the fat, and the right shoulder: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  and put them all on the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and
  offered them up for a wave-offering before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Moses took them at their hands, and Moses
  offered them on the altar, on the whole-burnt-offering of consecration, which
  is a smell of sweet savour: it is a burnt-offering to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Moses took the breast, and separated it for a
  heave-offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration; and it became
  Moses’ portion, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the
  blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments,
  and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his
  sons, and the garments of his sons with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the
  flesh in the tent of the tabernacle of witness in the holy place; and there
  ye shall eat it and the loaves in the basket of consecration, as it has been
  appointed me, the Lord saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And that which is left of the flesh
  and of the loaves burn ye with fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of witness for seven
  days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for in seven
  days shall he consecrate you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> as he
  did in this day on which the Lord commanded me to do so, to make an atonement
  for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And ye shall remain seven
  days at the door of the tabernacle of witness, day and night; ye shall
  observe the ordinances of the Lord, that ye die not; for so has the Lord God
  commanded me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Aaron and his sons
  performed all these commands which the Lord commanded Moses.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass on the eighth
  day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and Moses said to Aaron, Take to
  thyself a young calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a
  whole-burnt-offering, unblemished, and offer them before the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And speak to the elders of Israel,
  saying, Take one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a young calf, and a
  lamb of a year old for a whole-burnt-offering, spotless, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and a calf and a ram for a peace offering before
  the Lord, and fine flour mingled with oil, for to-day the Lord will appear
  among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they took as Moses
  commanded them before the tabernacle of witness, and all the congregation
  drew nigh, and they stood before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord
  has spoken; do it, and the glory of the Lord shall appear among you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Moses said to Aaron, Draw nigh to
  the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy whole-burnt-offering, and make
  atonement for thyself, and for thy house; and offer the gifts of the people,
  and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Aaron drew nigh to the altar, and slew the
  calf of his sin-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the sons
  of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood,
  and put it on the horns of the altar, and he poured out the blood at the
  bottom of the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he offered
  up on the altar the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the
  sin-offering, according as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire
  outside of the camp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he slew the
  whole-burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he
  poured it on the altar round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And they brought the whole-burnt-offering, according to its pieces; them and
  the head he put upon the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  he washed the belly and the feet with water, and he put them on the
  whole-burnt-offering on the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And he brought the gift of the people, and took the goat of the sin-offering
  of the people, and slew it, and purified it as also the first. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he brought the whole-burnt-offering, and
  offered it in due form. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he
  brought the sacrifice and filled his hands with it, and laid it on the altar,
  besides the morning whole-burnt-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he slew the calf, and the ram of the
  sacrifice of peace-offering of the people; and the sons of Aaron brought the
  blood to him, and he poured it out on the altar round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he took the fat of the calf, and the hind
  quarters of the ram, and the fat covering the belly, and the two kidneys, and
  the fat upon them, and the caul on the liver. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he put the fat on the breasts, and offered
  the fat on the altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Aaron
  separated the breast and the right shoulder as a choice-offering before the
  Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And Aaron lifted up his hands on the people and blessed them; and after he
  had offered the sin-offering, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the
  peace-offerings, he came down. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of witness. And they came out and
  blessed all the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And fire came forth from the Lord,
  and devoured the offerings on the altar, both the whole-burnt-offerings and
  the fat; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their
  faces.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the two sons of Aaron, Nadab
  and Abiud, took each his censer, and put fire therein, and threw incense
  thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which the Lord did not
  command them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and fire came forth from
  the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Moses said to Aaron, This is the thing which
  the Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified among them that draw night to
  me, and I will be glorified in the whole congregation; and Aaron was pricked
  in his heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Moses called
  Misadae, and Elisaphan, sons of Oziel, sons of the brother of Aaron’s father,
  and said to them, Draw near and take your brethren from before the sanctuary
  out of the camp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they came near
  and took them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses said. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Moses said to Aaron, and Eleazar and Ithamar
  his sons that were left, Ye shall not make bare your heads, and ye shall not
  tear your garments; that ye die not, and so there should be wrath on all the
  congregation: but your brethren, even all the house of Israel, shall lament
  for the burning, with which they were burnt by the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And ye shall not go forth from the door of the
  tabernacle of witness, that ye die not; for the Lord’s anointing oil is upon
  you: and they did according to the word of Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Ye shall not drink wine nor strong drink, thou and
  thy sons with thee, whensoever ye enter into the tabernacle of witness, or
  when ye approach the altar, so shall ye not die; it is a perpetual statute
  for your generations, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> to distinguish
  between sacred and profane, and between clean and unclean, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and to teach the children of Israel all the
  statutes, which the Lord spoke to them by Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and
  Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who survived, Take the sacrifice that is left of
  the burnt-offerings of the Lord, and ye shall eat unleavened bread by the
  altar: it is most holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And ye shall
  eat it in the holy place; for this is a statute for thee and a statute for
  thy sons, of the burnt-offerings to the Lord; for so it has been commanded
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye shall eat the breast of
  separation, and the shoulder of the choice-offering in the holy place, thou
  and thy sons and thy house with thee; for it has been given as an ordinance
  for thee and an ordinance for thy sons, of the sacrifices of peace-offering
  of the children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They shall
  bring the shoulder of the choice-offering, and the breast of the separation
  upon the burnt-offerings of the fat, to separate for a separation before the
  Lord; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for thee and thy sons and thy
  daughters with thee, as the Lord commanded Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Moses diligently sought the goat of the
  sin-offering, but it had been consumed by fire; and Moses was angry with
  Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron that were left, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Why did ye not eat the sin-offering in the holy
  place? for because it is most holy he has given you this to eat, that ye
  might take away the sin of the congregation, and make atonement for them
  before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the blood of it
  was not brought into the holy place: ye shall eat it within, before the Lord,
  as the Lord commanded me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Aaron
  spoke to Moses, saying, If they have brought nigh to-day their sin-offerings,
  and their whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord, and these events have
  happened to me, and yet I should eat to-day of the sin-offerings, would it be
  pleasing to the Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Moses heard
  it, and it pleased him.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and

  Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat of all beasts that
  are upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Every beast
  parting the hoof and making divisions of two claws, and chewing the cud among
  beasts, these ye shall eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But of
  these ye shall not eat, of those that chew the cud, and of those that part
  the hoofs, and divide claws; the camel, because it chews the cud, but does
  not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does
  not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you. <span style=

  hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, and it does not chew the cud, is unclean
  to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Ye shall not eat of their
  flesh, and ye shall not touch their carcases; these are unclean to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And these are what ye shall eat of all
  that are in the waters: all things that have fins and scales in the waters,

  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And all things which have not fins or scales in
  the water, or in the seas, and in the brooks, of all which the waters
  produce, and of every soul living in the water, are an abomination; and they
  shall be abominations to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ye
  shall not eat of their flesh, and ye shall abhor their carcases. <span style=

  animals, which go upon four feet, which have legs above their feet, to leap
  with on the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And these of them
  ye shall eat: the caterpillar and his like, and the attacus and his like, and
  the cantharus and his like, and the locust and his like. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Every creeping thing from among the birds, which
  has four feet, is an abomination to you. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And every one among all the wild
  beasts that moves upon its fore feet, which goes on all four, is unclean to
  you; every one that touches their dead bodies shall be unclean till evening.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he that takes of their dead
  bodies shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean till evening: these are

  These are unclean to you of all the reptiles which are on the earth; every

  fall it shall be unclean; whatever wooden vessel, or garment, or skin, or
  sack it may be, every vessel in which work should be done, shall be dipped in
  water, and shall be unclean till evening; and then it shall be clean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And every earthen vessel into which

  that is eaten, on which water shall come from such a vessel, shall be
  unclean; and every beverage which is drunk in any such vessel, shall be
  unclean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And every thing on which
  there shall fall of their dead bodies shall be unclean; ovens and stands for
  jars shall be broken down: these are unclean, and they shall be unclean to
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Only if the water be of
  fountains of water, or a pool, or confluence of water, it shall be clean; but
  he that touches their carcases shall be unclean. <span style=

  sowing seed which shall be sown, it shall be clean. <span style=

  their dead bodies fall upon it, it is unclean to you. <span style=

  for you to eat, he that touches their carcases shall be unclean till evening.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And he that eats of their carcases
  shall wash his garments, and be unclean till evening; and he that carries any
  of their carcases shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and be
  unclean till evening. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And every
  reptile that creeps on the earth, this shall be an abomination to you; it
  shall not be eaten. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And every animal
  that creeps on its belly, and every one that goes on four feet continually,
  which abounds with feet among all the reptiles creeping upon the earth—ye
  shall not eat it, for it is an abomination to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And ye shall not defile your souls with any of
  the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and ye shall not be polluted with
  them, and ye shall not be unclean by them. <span style=

  sanctified, and ye shall be holy, because I the Lord your God am holy; and ye
  shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles creeping upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> For I am the Lord who brought you up

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,

  Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever woman shall have conceived and
  born a male child shall be unclean seven days, she shall be unclean according
  to the days of separation for her monthly courses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And on the eighth day she shall circumcise the
  flesh of his foreskin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And for
  thirty-three days she shall continue in her unclean blood; she shall touch
  nothing holy, and shall not enter the sanctuary, until the days of her
  purification be fulfilled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if she
  should have born a female child, then she shall be unclean twice seven days,
  according to the time of her monthly courses; and for sixty-six days shall
  she remain in her unclean blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  when the days of her purification shall have been fulfilled for a son or a

  the door of the tabernacle of witness, to the priest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he shall present it before the Lord, and the

  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if she cannot afford a lamb, then shall she
  take two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for a whole-burnt-offering,

  she shall be purified.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and
  Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> If any man should have
  in the skin of his flesh a bright clear spot, and there should be in the skin
  of his flesh a plague of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or
  to one of his sons the priests. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the priest shall view the spot in the skin of his flesh; and if the hair in
  the spot be changed to white, and the appearance of the spot be below the
  skin of the flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look upon
  it, and pronounce him unclean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But if
  the spot be clear and white in the skin of his flesh, yet the appearance of
  it be not deep below the skin, and its hair have not changed itself for white
  hair, but it is dark, then the priest shall separate him that has the spot
  seven days; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and the priest shall look
  on the spot the seventh day; and, behold, if the spot remains before him, if
  the spot has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall separate him the
  second time seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the priest
  shall look upon him the second time on the seventh day; and, behold, if the
  spot be dark, and the spot have not spread in the skin, then the priest shall
  pronounce him clean; for it is a mere mark, and the man shall wash his
  garments and be clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But if the
  bright spot should have changed and spread in the skin, after the priest has
  seen him for the purpose of purifying him, then shall he appear the second
  time to the priest, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and the priest
  shall look upon him; and, behold, if the mark have spread in the skin, then
  the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if a man have a plague of leprosy, then he
  shall come to the priest; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and the
  priest shall look, and, behold, if it is a white spot in the skin, and it has
  changed the hair to white, and there be some of the sound part of the quick
  flesh in the sore— <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> it is a leprosy
  waxing old in the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him
  unclean, and shall separate him, because he is unclean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And if the leprosy should have come out very
  evidently in the skin, and the leprosy should cover all the skin of the
  patient from the head to the feet, wheresoever the priest shall look;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> then the priest shall look, and,
  behold, the leprosy has covered all the skin of the flesh; and the priest
  shall pronounce him clean of the plague, because it has changed all to white,
  it is clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But on whatsoever day
  the quick flesh shall appear on him, he shall be pronounced unclean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the priest shall look upon the
  sound flesh, and the sound flesh shall prove him to be unclean; for it is
  unclean, it is a leprosy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But if the
  sound flesh be restored and changed to white, then shall he come to the
  priest; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and the priest shall see him,
  and, behold, if the plague is turned white, then the priest shall pronounce
  the patient clean: he is clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  if the flesh should have become an ulcer in his skin, and should be healed,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and there should be in the place of
  the ulcer a white sore, or one looking white and bright, or fiery, and it
  shall be seen by the priest; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> then the
  priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance be beneath the skin, and
  its hair has changed to white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean;
  because it is a leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But if the priest look, and behold there is no
  white hair on it, and it be not below the skin of the flesh, and it be
  dark-coloured; then the priest shall separate him seven days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But if it manifestly spread over the skin, then
  the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy; it has
  broken out in the ulcer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But if the
  bright spot should remain in its place and not spread, it is the scar of the
  ulcer; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And if the flesh be in his skin in a state of
  fiery inflammation, and there should be in his skin the part which is healed
  of the inflammation, bright, clear, and white, suffused with red or very
  white; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> then the priest shall look
  upon him, and, behold, if the hair being white is changed to a bright colour,
  and its appearance is lower than the skin, it is a leprosy; it has broken out
  in the inflammation, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
  plague of leprosy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But if the priest
  should look, and, behold, there is not in the bright spot any white hair, and
  it should not be lower than the skin, and it should be dark, then the priest
  shall separate him seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And
  the priest shall look upon him on the seventh day; and if the spot be much
  spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
  plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if the bright spot remain stationary, and be
  not spread in the skin, but the sore should be dark, it is a scar of
  inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the mark of
  the inflammation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if a man or a
  woman have in them a plague of leprosy in the head or the beard; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> then the priest shall look on the plague, and,
  behold, if the appearance of it be beneath the skin, and in it there be thin
  yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scurf,
  it is a leprosy of the head or a leprosy of the beard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And if the priest should see the plague of the
  scurf, and, behold, the appearance of it be not beneath the skin, and there
  is no yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall set apart him that has the
  plague of the scurf seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  the priest shall look at the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the
  scurf be not spread, and there be no yellowish hair on it, and the appearance
  of the scurf is not hollow under the skin; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> then the skin shall be shaven, but the scurf
  shall not be shaven; and the priest shall set aside the person having the
  scurf the second time for seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  And the priest shall see the scurf on the seventh day; and, behold, if the
  scurf is not spread in the skin after the man’s being shaved, and the
  appearance of the scurf is not hollow beneath the skin, then the priest shall
  pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his garments, and be clean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But if the scurf be indeed spread in
  the skin after he has been purified, <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  then the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scurf be spread in the skin,
  the priest shall not examine concerning the yellow hair, for he is unclean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But if the scurf remain before him in
  its place, and a dark hair should have arisen in it, the scurf is healed: he
  is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And if a man or woman should have in the skin of
  their flesh spots of a bright whiteness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> then the priest shall look; and, behold, there
  being bright spots of a bright whiteness in the skin of their flesh, it is a
  tetter; it burst forth in the skin of his flesh; he is clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And if any one’s head should lose the hair, he is
  only bald, he is clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And if his
  head should lose the hair in front, he is forehead bald: he is clean.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And if there should be in his
  baldness of head, or his baldness of forehead, a white or fiery plague, it is
  leprosy in his baldness of head, or baldness of forehead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And the priest shall look upon him, and, behold,
  if the appearance of the plague be white or inflamed in his baldness of head
  or baldness in front, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of his flesh,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> he is a leprous man: the priest shall
  surely pronounce him unclean, his plague is in his head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And the leper in whom the plague is, let his
  garments be ungirt, and his head uncovered; and let him have a covering put
  upon his mouth, and he shall be called unclean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> All the days in which the plague shall be upon
  him, being unclean, he shall be esteemed unclean; he shall dwell apart, his
  place of sojourn shall be without the camp. <span style=

  leprosy, a garment of wool, or a garment of flax, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> either in the warp or in the woof, or in the
  linen, or in the woollen threads, or in a skin, or in any workmanship of
  skin, <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> and the plague be greenish or
  reddish in the skin, or in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof,
  or in any utensil of skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and he shall show it to
  the priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And the priest shall look
  upon the plague, and the priest shall set apart that which has the plague
  seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And the priest shall look
  upon the plague on the seventh day; and if the plague be spread in the
  garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in the skin, in whatsoever
  things skins may be used in their workmanship, the plague is a confirmed
  leprosy; it is unclean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> He shall burn
  the garment, either the warp or woof in woollen garments or in flaxen, or in
  any utensil of skin, in which there may be the plague; because it is a
  confirmed leprosy; it shall be burnt with fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And if the priest should see, and the plague be
  not spread in the garments, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any
  utensil of skin, <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> then the priest
  shall give directions, and one shall wash that on which there may have been
  the plague, and the priest shall set it aside a second time for seven days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And the priest shall look upon it
  after the plague has been washed; and if this, even the plague, has not
  changed its appearance, and the plague does not spread, it is unclean; it
  shall be burnt with fire: it is fixed in the garment, in the warp, or in the
  woof. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And if the priest should look,
  and the spot be dark after it has been washed, he shall tear it off from the
  garment, either from the warp or from the woof, or from the skin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And if it should still appear in the
  garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, it is
  a leprosy bursting forth: that wherein is the plague shall be burnt with
  fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And the garment, or the warp,
  or the woof, or any article of skin, which shall be washed, and the plague
  depart from it, shall also be washed again, and shall be clean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> This is the law of the plague of leprosy of a
  woollen or linen garment, either of the warp, or woof, or any leathern
  article, to pronounce it clean or unclean.</p>

  And the priest shall give directions, and they shall take for him that is
  cleansed two clean live birds, and cedar wood, and spun scarlet, and hyssop.

  shall dip them and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was slain
  over running water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he shall

  is in his left hand, and he shall sprinkle with his finger seven times before
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the remaining oil that
  is in his hand, the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him that
  is under cleansing, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe
  of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the remaining oil that is on the
  hand of the priest, the priest shall put on the head of the cleansed leper,
  and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord. <span style=

  and the priest shall make atonement for the person under purification to
  cleanse him from his sin, and afterwards the priest shall slay the
  whole-burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the priest
  shall offer the whole-burnt-offering, and the sacrifice upon the altar before
  the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be
  cleansed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if he should be poor,
  and cannot afford so much, he shall take one lamb for his transgression for a
  separate-offering, so as to make propitiation for him, and a tenth deal of
  fine flour mingled with oil for a sacrifice, and one cup of oil, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, as he
  can afford; and the one shall be for a sin-offering, and the other for a
  whole-burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he shall
  bring them on the eighth day, to purify him, to the priest, to the door of
  the tabernacle of witness before the Lord. <span style=

  the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of

  his right hand some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the priest shall put of
  the oil that is on his hand on the tip of the right ear of him that is under
  purification, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his
  right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And that which is left of the oil which is on the
  hand of the priest he shall put on the head of him that is purged, and the
  priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves or of
  the young pigeons, as he can afford it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> the one for a sin-offering, the other for a
  whole-burnt-offering with the meat-offering, and the priest shall make an
  atonement before the Lord for him that is under purification. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> This is the law for him in whom is the plague of
  leprosy, and who cannot afford the offerings for his purification.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and
  Aaron, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Whensoever ye shall
  enter into the land of the Chananites, which I give you for a possession, and
  I shall put the plague of leprosy in the houses of the land of your
  possession; <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> then the owner of the
  house shall come and report to the priest, saying, I have seen as it were a
  plague in the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the priest
  shall give orders to remove the furniture of the house, before the priest
  comes in to see the plague, and thus none of the things in the house shall
  become unclean; and afterwards the priest shall go in to examine the house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he shall look on the plague, and,
  behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house, he will see greenish or
  reddish cavities, and the appearance of them will be beneath the surface of
  the walls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the priest shall come
  out of the house to the door of the house, and the priest shall separate the
  house seven days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And the priest
  shall return on the seventh day and view the house; and, behold, if the
  plague is spread in the walls of the house, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> then the priest shall give orders, and they shall
  take away the stones in which the plague is, and shall cast them out of the
  city into an unclean place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And they
  shall scrape the house within round about, and shall pour out the dust
  scraped off outside the city into an unclean place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And they shall take other scraped stones, and put
  them in the place of the former stones, and they shall take other plaster and
  plaster the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And if the plague
  should return again, and break out in the house after they have taken away
  the stones and after the house is scraped, and after it has been plastered,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> then the priest shall go in and see
  if the plague is spread in the house: it is a confirmed leprosy in the house,
  it is unclean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And they shall take
  down the house, and its timbers and its stones, and they shall carry out all
  the mortar without the city into an unclean place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And he that goes into the house at any time,
  during its separation, shall be unclean until evening. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And he that sleeps in the house shall wash his
  garments, and be unclean until evening; and he that eats in the house shall
  wash his garments, and be unclean until evening. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> and if the priest shall arrive and enter and see,
  and behold the plague be not at all spread in the house after the house has
  been plastered, then the priest shall declare the house clean, because the
  plague is healed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And he shall take
  to purify the house two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and spun scarlet,
  and hyssop. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And he shall slay one
  bird in an earthen vessel over running water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And he shall take the cedar wood, and the spun
  scarlet, and the hyssop, and the living bird; and shall dip it into the blood
  of the bird slain over running water, and with them he shall sprinkle the
  house seven times. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> and he shall
  purify the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and
  with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with
  the spun scarlet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And he shall let
  the living bird go out of the city into the field, and shall make atonement
  for the house, and it shall be clean. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span>
  This is the law concerning every plague of leprosy and scurf, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> and of the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> and of a sore, and of a clear spot,
  and of a shining one, <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> and of
  declaring in what day it is unclean, and in what day it shall be purged: this
  is the law of the leprosy.</p>

  affected through the issue: all the days of the issue of his body, by which
  his body is affected through the issue, there is his uncleanness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Every bed on which he that has the
  issue shall happen to lie, is unclean; and every seat on which he that has

  which he that has the issue shall happen to touch, shall be broken; and a

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses after
  the two sons of Aaron died in bringing strange fire before the Lord, so they
  died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said to Moses,
  Speak to Aaron thy brother, and let him not come in at all times into the
  holy place within the veil before the propitiatory, which is upon the ark of
  the testimony, and he shall not die; for I will appear in a cloud on the
  propitiatory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thus shall Aaron enter
  into the holy place; with a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and having a
  ram for a whole-burnt-offering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he
  shall put on the consecrated linen tunic, and he shall have on his flesh the
  linen drawers, and shall gird himself with a linen girdle, and shall put on
  the linen cap, they are holy garments; and he shall bathe all his body in
  water, and shall put them on. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he
  shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the
  goats for a sin-offering, and one lamb for a whole-burnt-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Aaron shall bring the calf for his

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he shall take the two goats, and
  place them before the Lord by the door of the tabernacle of witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two
  goats, one lot for the Lord, and the other for the scape-goat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Aaron shall bring forward the goat on which
  the lot for the Lord fell, and shall offer him for a sin-offering.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and the goat upon which the lot of
  the scape-goat came, he shall present alive before the Lord, to make
  atonement upon him, so as to send him away as a scape-goat, and he shall send
  him into the wilderness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Aaron
  shall bring the calf for his sin, and he shall make atonement for himself and
  for his house, and he shall kill the calf for his sin-offering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he shall take his censer full of coals of
  fire off the altar, which is before the Lord; and he shall fill his hands
  with fine compound incense, and shall bring it within the veil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall put the incense on the fire before
  the Lord, and the smoke of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat over the
  tables of testimony, and he shall not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he shall take of the blood of the calf, and
  sprinkle with his finger on the mercy-seat eastward: before the mercy-seat
  shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he shall kill the goat for the sin-offering
  that is for the people, before the Lord; and he shall bring in of its blood
  within the veil, and shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the
  calf, and shall sprinkle its blood on the mercy-seat, in front of the
  mercy-seat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and he shall make
  atonement for the sanctuary on account of the uncleanness of the children of
  Israel, and for their trespasses in the matter of all their sins; and thus
  shall he do to the tabernacle of witness established among them in the midst
  of their uncleanness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and there shall
  be no man in the tabernacle of witness, when he goes in to make atonement in
  the holy place, until he shall have come out; and he shall make atonement for
  himself, and for his house, and for all the congregation of the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he shall come forth to
  the altar that is before the Lord, and he shall make atonement upon it; and
  he shall take of the blood of the calf, and of the blood of the goat, and
  shall put it on the horns of the altar round about. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he shall sprinkle some of the blood upon it
  seven times with his finger, and shall purge it, and hallow it from the
  uncleanness of the children of Israel. <span style=

  into the tabernacle of witness, and shall put off the linen garment, which he
  had put on, as he entered into the holy place, and shall lay it by there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he shall bathe his body in water
  in the holy place, and shall put on his raiment, and shall go out and offer
  the whole-burnt-offering for himself and the whole-burnt-offering for the
  people: and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and for the
  people, as for the priests. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he
  shall offer the fat for the sin-offering on the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he that sends forth the goat that has been
  set apart to be let go, shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water,

  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the calf for the sin-offering, and the goat
  for the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
  holy place, they shall carry forth out of the camp, and burn them with fire,
  even their skins and their flesh and their dung. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And this shall be a perpetual statute
  for you; in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall humble
  your souls, and shall do no work, the native and the stranger who abides
  among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For in this day he shall

  whomsoever they shall anoint shall make atonement, and whomsoever they shall
  consecrate to exercise the priestly office after his father; and he shall put
  on the linen robe, the holy garment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and the tabernacle of

  No man shall draw nigh to any of his near kindred to uncover their nakedness;
  I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou shalt not uncover

  mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <span style=

  daughter’s daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; because it is
  thy nakedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou shalt not uncover
  the nakedness of the daughter of thy father’s wife; she is thy sister by the
  same father: thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <span style=

  father’s sister, for she is near akin to thy father. <span style=

  uncover her nakedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thou shalt not
  uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The nakedness of a woman and her

  shalt not give of thy seed to serve a ruler; and thou shalt not profane my
  holy name; I am the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And thou
  shalt not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is an abomination.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Neither shalt thou lie with any
  quadruped for copulation, to be polluted with it: neither shall a woman
  present herself before any quadruped to have connexion with it; for it is an
  abomination. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Do not defile yourselves
  with any of these things; for in all these things the nations are defiled,
  which I drive out before you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and the
  land is polluted; and I have recompensed their iniquity to them because of
  it, and the land is aggrieved with them that dwell upon it. <span style=

  on the third day, it is unfit for sacrifice: it shall not be accepted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he that eats it shall bear his
  iniquity, because he has profaned the holy things of the Lord; and the souls
  that eat it shall be destroyed from among their people. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ye shall not steal, ye shall not lie,
  neither shall one bear false witness as an informer against his neighbour.

  Thou shalt not revile the deaf, neither shalt thou put a stumbling-block in

  thou shalt not put upon thyself a mingled garment woven of two materials.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And if any one lie carnally with a

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he shall bring for his trespass
  to the Lord to the door of the tabernacle of witness, a ram for a

  shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, before
  the Lord, for the sin which he sinned; and the sin which he sinned shall be
  forgiven him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And whenever ye shall

  And ye shall not make cuttings in your body for a dead body, and ye shall not

  Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man,

  those who have become proselytes in Israel, who shall give of his seed to
  Moloch, let him be surely put to death; the nation upon the land shall stone
  him with stones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I will set my
  face against that man, and will cut him off from his people, because he has
  given of his seed to Moloch, to defile my sanctuary, and profane the name of
  them that are consecrated to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And
  if the natives of the land should in anywise overlook that man in giving of
  his seed to Moloch, so as not to put him to death; <span style=

  with his daughter-in-law, let them both be put to death; for they have
  wrought impiety, they are guilty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And

  abomination; let them die the death, they are guilty. <span style=

  uncovered the nakedness of one near akin to him: they shall die childless.

  have abhorred them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and I said to
  you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you for a possession,
  even a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the Lord your God, who have

  Say to them, Every man throughout your generations, whoever of all your seed

  until he be cleansed; and he that touches any uncleanness of a dead body, or
  the man whose seed of copulation shall have gone out from him, <span style=

  which will defile him, or who shall touch a man, whereby he shall defile him

  whatsoever soul shall touch them shall be unclean until evening; he shall not
  eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and the sun go down, and then he shall be clean;
  and then shall he eat of all the holy things, for they are his bread.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He shall not eat that which dies of
  itself, or is taken of beasts, so that he should be polluted by them: I am
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they shall keep my
  ordinances, that they do not bear iniquity because of them, and die because
  of them, if they shall profane them: I am the Lord God that sanctifies them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And no stranger shall eat the holy
  things: one that sojourns with a priest, or a hireling, shall not eat the
  holy things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But if a priest should
  have a soul purchased for money, he shall eat of his bread; and they that are

  her youth: she shall eat of her father’s bread, but no stranger shall eat of
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the man who shall ignorantly

  to the Lord, discharging a vow, or in the way of free-will-offering, or an
  offering in your feasts, of the herds or of the sheep, it shall be without
  blemish for acceptance: there shall be no blemish in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> One that is blind, or broken, or has its tongue
  cut out, or is troubled with warts, or has a malignant ulcer, or tetters,
  they shall not offer these to the Lord; neither shall ye offer any of them
  for a burnt-offering on the altar of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And a calf or a sheep with the ears cut off, or
  that has lost its tail, thou shalt slay them for thyself; but they shall not

  offer them to the Lord, neither shall ye sacrifice them upon your land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Neither shall ye offer the gifts of
  your God of all these things by the hand of a stranger, because there is
  corruption in them, a blemish in them: these shall not be accepted for you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> As for a calf, or a sheep, or a goat,
  whenever it is born, then shall it be seven days under its mother; and on the
  eighth day and after they shall be accepted for sacrifices, a burnt-offering
  to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And a bullock and a ewe,
  it and its young, thou shalt not kill in one day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if thou shouldest offer a sacrifice, a vow of
  rejoicing to the Lord, ye shall offer it so as to be accepted for you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> In that same day it shall be eaten;
  ye shall not leave of the flesh till the morrow: I am the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And ye shall keep my commandments and do them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And ye shall not profane the name of
  the Holy One, and I will be sanctified in the midst of the children of
  Israel. I am the Lord that sanctifies you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be
  your God: I am the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the children of
  Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, The feasts of the Lord which ye shall
  call holy assemblies, these are my feasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Six days shalt thou do works, but on the seventh
  day is the sabbath; a rest, a holy convocation to the Lord: thou shalt not do
  any work, it is a sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> These are the feasts to the Lord, holy
  convocations, which ye shall call in their seasons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the
  month, between the evening times is the Lord’s passover. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And on the fifteenth day of this month is the
  feast of unleavened bread to the Lord; seven days shall ye eat unleavened
  bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the first day shall be a
  holy convocation to you: ye shall do no servile work. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And ye shall offer whole-burnt-offerings to the
  Lord seven days; and the seventh day shall be a holy convocation to you: ye
  shall do no servile work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Speak to the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye shall enter into the
  land which I give you, and reap the harvest of it, then shall ye bring a
  sheaf, the first-fruits of your harvest, to the priest; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and he shall lift up the sheaf before the Lord,
  to be accepted for you. On the morrow of the first day the priest shall lift
  it up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And ye shall offer on the day
  on which ye bring the sheaf, a lamb without blemish of a year old for a
  whole-burnt-offering to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  its meat-offering two tenth portions of fine flour mingled with oil: it is a
  sacrifice to the Lord, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord, and its
  drink-offering the fourth part of a hin of wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye shall not eat bread, or the new parched
  corn, until this same day, until ye offer the sacrifices to your God: it is a
  perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And ye shall number to yourselves
  from the day after the sabbath, from the day on which ye shall offer the
  sheaf of the heave-offering, seven full weeks: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> until the morrow after the last week ye shall
  number fifty days, and shall bring a new meat-offering to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Ye shall bring from your dwelling
  loaves, as a heave-offering, two loaves: they shall be of two tenth portions
  of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven of the first-fruits to the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And ye shall bring with the
  loaves seven unblemished lambs of a year old, and one calf of the herd, and
  two rams without blemish, and they shall be a whole-burnt-offering to the
  Lord: and their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings shall be a
  sacrifice, a smell of sweet savour to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for
  a sin-offering, and two lambs of a year old for a peace-offering, with the
  loaves of the first-fruits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  priest shall place them with the loaves of the first-fruits an offering
  before the Lord with the two lambs, they shall be holy to the Lord; they
  shall belong to the priest that brings them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And ye shall call this day a convocation: it
  shall be holy to you; ye shall do no servile work on it: it is a perpetual
  ordinance throughout your generations in all your habitations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And when ye shall reap the harvest of your land,
  ye shall not fully reap the remainder of the harvest of your field when thou
  reapest, and thou shalt not gather that which falls from thy reaping; thou
  shalt leave it for the poor and the stranger: I am the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Speak to the children of Israel,
  saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a
  rest, a memorial of trumpets: it shall be to you a holy convocation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Ye shall do no servile work, and ye
  shall offer a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Also on the tenth day of this seventh month is a
  day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation to you; and ye shall humble
  your souls, and offer a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Ye shall do no work on this self-same day: for
  this is a day of atonement for you, to make atonement for you before the Lord
  your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Every soul that shall not
  be humbled in that day, shall be cut off from among its people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And every soul which shall do work on that day,
  that soul shall be destroyed from among its people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a perpetual
  statute throughout your generations in all your habitations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> It shall be a holy sabbath to you; and ye shall
  humble your souls, from the ninth day of the month: from evening to evening
  ye shall keep your sabbaths. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the
  Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Speak to
  the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month,
  there shall be a feast of tabernacles seven days to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And on the first day shall be a holy convocation;
  ye shall do no servile work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Seven
  days shall ye offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, and the eighth-day
  shall be a holy convocation to you; and ye shall offer whole-burnt-offerings
  to the Lord: it is a time of release, ye shall do no servile work.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> These are the feasts to the Lord,
  which ye shall call holy convocations, to offer burnt-offerings to the Lord,
  whole-burnt-offerings and their meat-offerings, and their drink-offerings,
  that for each day on its day: <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> besides
  the sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows,
  and besides your free-will-offerings, which ye shall give to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And on the fifteenth day of this
  seventh month, when ye shall have completely gathered in the fruits of the
  earth, ye shall keep a feast to the Lord seven days; on the first day there
  shall be a rest, and on the eighth day a rest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And on the first day ye shall take goodly fruit
  of trees, and branches of palm trees, and thick boughs of trees, and willows,
  and branches of osiers from the brook, to rejoice before the Lord your God
  seven days in the year. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> It is a
  perpetual statute for your generations: in the seventh month ye shall keep
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Seven days ye shall dwell in
  tabernacles: every native in Israel shall dwell in tents, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> that your posterity may see, that I made the
  children of Israel to dwell in tents, when I brought them out of the land of
  Egypt: I am the Lord your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And
  Moses recounted the feasts of the Lord to the children of Israel.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Charge the children of Israel,
  and let them take for thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to burn a
  lamp continually, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> outside the veil in
  the tabernacle of witness; and Aaron and his sons shall burn it from evening
  until morning before the Lord continually, a perpetual statute throughout
  your generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye shall burn the
  lamps on the pure lamp-stand before the Lord till the morrow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And ye shall take fine flour, and make of it
  twelve loaves; each loaf shall be of two tenth parts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall put them in two rows, each row
  containing six loaves, on the pure table before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And ye shall put on each row pure frankincense and
  salt; and these things shall be for loaves for a memorial, set forth before
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> On the sabbath-day they
  shall be set forth before the Lord continually before the children of Israel,
  for an everlasting covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they
  shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat them in the holy place:
  for this is their most holy portion of the offerings made to the Lord, a
  perpetual statute. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there went
  forth a son of an Israelitish woman, and he was son of an Egyptian man among
  the sons of Israel; and they fought in the camp, the son of the Israelitish
  woman, and a man who was an Israelite. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the son of the Israelitish woman named THE
  NAME and curse; and they brought him to Moses: and his mother’s name was
  Salomith, daughter of Dabri of the tribe of Dan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they put him in ward, to judge him by the
  command of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to Moses, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Bring forth
  him that cursed outside the camp, and all who heard shall lay their hands
  upon his head, and all the congregation shall stone him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And speak to the sons of Israel, and thou shalt
  say to them, Whosoever shall curse God shall bear his sin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he that names the name of the Lord, let him
  die the death: let all the congregation of Israel stone him with stones;
  whether he be a stranger or a native, let him die for naming the name of the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And whosoever shall smite a man
  and he die, let him die the death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And whosoever shall smite a beast, and it shall die, let him render life for
  life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And whosoever shall inflict a
  blemish on his neighbour, as he has done to him, so shall it be done to
  himself in return; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> bruise for bruise,
  eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as any one may inflict a blemish on a man, so
  shall it be rendered to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Whosoever shall smite a man, and he shall die, let him die the death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> There shall be one judgment for the
  stranger and the native, for I am the Lord your God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and
  they brought him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones:
  and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus25">25</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses in the
  mount Sina, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the
  children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whensoever ye shall have
  entered into the land, which I give to you, then the land shall rest which I
  give to you, for its sabbaths to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years
  thou shall prune thy vine, and gather in its fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath, it
  shall be a rest to the land, a sabbath to the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy
  field, and thou shalt not prune thy vine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And thou shalt not gather the spontaneous produce
  of thy field, and thou shalt not gather fully the grapes of thy dedication:
  it shall be a year of rest to the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the sabbaths of the land shall be food for
  thee, and for thy man-servant, and for thy maid-servant, and thy hireling,
  and the stranger that abides with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And for thy cattle, and for the wild beats that
  are in thy land, shall every fruit of it be for food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou shalt reckon to thyself seven sabbaths of
  years, seven times seven years; and they shall be to thee seven weeks of
  years, nine and forty years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> In the
  seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall make a proclamation
  with the sound of a trumpet in all your land; on the day of atonement ye
  shall make a proclamation with a trumpet in all your land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And ye shall sanctify the year, the fiftieth
  year, and ye shall proclaim a release upon the land to all that inhabit it;
  it shall be given a year of release, a jubilee for you; and each one shall
  depart to his possession, and ye shall go each to his family. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> This is a jubilee of release, the year shall be
  to you the fiftieth year: ye shall not sow, nor reap the produce that comes
  of itself from the land, neither shall ye gather its dedicated fruits.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For it is a jubilee of release; it
  shall be holy to you, ye shall eat its fruits off the fields. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> In the year of the release even the jubilee of
  it, shall each one return to his possession. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if thou shouldest sell a possession to thy
  neighbour, or if thou shouldest buy of thy neighbour, let not a man oppress
  his neighbour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> According to the
  number of years after the jubilee shalt thou buy of thy neighbour, according
  to the number of years of the fruits shall he sell to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> According as there may be a greater number of
  years he shall increase the value of his possession, and according as there
  may be a less number of years he shall lessen the value of his possession;
  for according to the number of his crops, so shall he sell to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let not a man oppress his neighbour,
  and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God: I am the Lord thy God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my
  judgments; and do ye observe them, and ye shall keep them, and dwell securely
  in the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the land shall yield
  her increase, and ye shall eat to fullness, and shall dwell securely in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And if ye should say, What shall we
  eat in this seventh year, if we do not sow nor gather in our fruits?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Then will I send my blessing upon you
  in the sixth year, and the land shall produce its fruits for three years.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And ye shall sow in the eighth year,
  and eat old fruits till the ninth year: until its fruit come, ye shall eat
  old fruits of the old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the land
  shall not be sold for a permanence; for the land is mine, because ye are
  strangers and sojourners before me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And in every land of your possession, ye shall allow ransoms for the land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And if thy brother who is with thee
  be poor, and should have sold part of his possession, and his kinsman who is
  nigh to him come, then he shall redeem the possession which his brother has
  sold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And if one have no near
  kinsman, and he prosper with his hand, and he find sufficient money, even his
  ransom; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> then shall he calculate the
  years of his sale, and he shall give what is due to the man to whom he sold
  it, and he shall return to his possession. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if his hand have not prospered sufficiently,
  so as that he should restore the money to him, then he that bought the
  possessions shall have them till the sixth year of the release; and it shall
  go out in the release, and the owner shall return to his possession.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if any one should sell an
  inhabited house in a walled city, then there shall be the ransom of it, until
  the time is fulfilled: its time of ransom shall be a full year. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And if it be not ransomed until there be
  completed of its time a full year, the house which is in the walled city
  shall be surely confirmed to him that bought it, throughout his generations;
  and it shall not go out in the release. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But the houses in the villages which have not a
  wall round about them, shall be reckoned as the fields of the country: they
  shall always be redeemable, and they shall go out in the release.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the cities of the Levites, the
  houses of the cities in their possession, shall be always redeemable to the
  Levites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And if any one shall redeem
  a house of the Levites, then shall their sale of the houses of their
  possession go out in the release; because the houses of the cities of the
  Levites are their possession in the midst of the children of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And the lands set apart for their
  cities shall not be sold, because this is their perpetual possession.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And if thy brother who is with thee
  become poor, and he fail in resources with thee, thou shalt help him as a
  stranger and a sojourner, and thy brother shall live with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Thou shalt not receive from him interest, nor
  increase: and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord: and thy brother shall
  live with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Thou shalt not lend
  thy money to him at interest, and thou shalt not lend thy meat to him to be
  returned with increase. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> I am the Lord
  your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of
  Chanaan, so as to be your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And if
  thy brother by thee be lowered, and be sold to thee, he shall not serve thee
  with the servitude of a slave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> He
  shall be with thee as a hireling or a sojourner, he shall work for thee till
  the year of release: <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> and he shall go
  out in the release, and his children with him; and he shall go to his family,
  he shall hasten back to his patrimony. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Because these are my servants, whom I brought out
  of the land of Egypt; such an one shall not be sold as a common servant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Thou shalt not oppress him with
  labour, and shalt fear the Lord thy God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And whatever number of men-servants and
  maid-servants thou shalt have, thou shalt purchase male and female servants
  from the nations that are round about thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And of the sons of the sojourners that are among
  you, of these ye shall buy and of their relations, all that shall be in your
  lands; let them be to you for a possession. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And ye shall distribute them to your children
  after you, and they shall be to you permanent possessions for ever: but of
  your brethren the children of Israel, one shall not oppress his brother in
  labours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And if a stranger or
  sojourner with thee wax rich, and thy brother in distress be sold to the
  stranger or the sojourner that is with thee, or to a proselyte by extraction;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> after he is sold to him there shall
  be redemption for him, one of his brethren shall redeem him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> A brother of his father, or a son of his father’s
  brother shall redeem him; or let one of his near kin of his tribe redeem him,
  and if he should be rich and redeem himself, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> then shall he calculate with his purchaser from
  the year that he sold himself to him until the year of release: and the money
  of his purchase shall be as that of a hireling, he shall be with him from
  year to year. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And if any have a
  greater number of years than enough, according to these he shall pay his
  ransom out of his purchase-money. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And
  if but a little time be left of the years to the year of release, then shall
  he reckon to him according to his years, and shall pay his ransom
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> as a hireling; he shall be with him
  from year to year; thou shalt not oppress him with labour before thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And if he do not pay his ransom
  accordingly, he shall go out in the year of his release, he and his children
  with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> For the children of Israel
  are my servants: they are my attendants, whom I brought out of the land of
  Egypt.</p>

  and I will walk among you, and be your God, and ye shall be my people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I am the Lord your God, who brought
  you out of the land of Egypt, where ye were slaves; and I broke the band of
  your yoke, and brought you forth openly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if ye will not hearken to me, nor obey these
  my ordinances, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but disobey them, and
  your soul should loathe my judgments, so that ye should not keep all my
  commands, so as to break my covenant, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  then will I do thus to you: I will even bring upon you perplexity and the
  itch, and the fever that causes your eyes to waste away, and disease that
  consumes your life; and ye shall sow your seeds in vain, and your enemies
  shall eat them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will set my
  face against you, and ye shall fall before your enemies, and they that hate
  you shall pursue you; and ye shall flee, no one pursuing you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if ye still refuse to hearken to me, then
  will I chasten you yet more even seven times for your sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I will break down the haughtiness of your
  pride; and I will make your heaven iron, and your earth as it were brass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And your strength shall be in vain;
  and your land shall not yield its seed, and the tree of your field shall not
  yield its fruit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if after this ye
  should walk perversely, and not be willing to obey me, I will further bring
  upon you seven plagues according to your sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I will send upon you the wild beasts of the
  land, and they shall devour you, and shall consume your cattle: and I will
  make you few in number, and your ways shall be desolate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And if hereupon ye are not corrected, but walk
  perversely towards me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> I also will
  walk with you with a perverse spirit, and I also will smite you seven times
  for your sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I will bring upon
  you a sword avenging the cause of my covenant, and ye shall flee for refuge
  to your cities; and I will send out death against you, and ye shall be
  delivered into the hands of your enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> When I afflict you with famine of bread, then ten
  women shall bake your loaves in one oven, and they shall render your loaves
  by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if hereupon ye will not obey me, but walk
  perversely towards me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> then will I
  walk with you with a froward mind, and I will chasten you seven-fold
  according to your sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And ye shall
  eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And I will render your pillars
  desolate, and will utterly destroy your wooden images made with hands; and I
  will lay your carcases on the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall
  loathe you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And I will lay your
  cities waste, and I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell
  the savour of your sacrifices. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And I
  will lay your land desolate, and your enemies who dwell in it shall wonder at
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And I will scatter you among the
  nations, and the sword shall come upon you and consume you; and your land
  shall be desolate, and your cities shall be desolate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths all the
  days of its desolation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And ye shall
  be in the land of your enemies; then the land shall keep its sabbaths, and
  the land shall enjoy its sabbaths all the days of its desolation: it shall
  keep sabbaths which it kept not among your sabbaths, when ye dwelt in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And to those who are left of you I
  will bring bondage into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the
  sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleeing from
  war, and shall fall when none pursues them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And brother shall disregard brother as in war,
  when none pursues; and ye shall not be able to withstand your enemies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And ye shall perish among the
  Gentiles, and the land of your enemies shall devour you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And those who are left of you shall perish,
  because of their sins, and because of the sins of their fathers: in the land
  of their enemies shall they consume away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they shall confess their sins, and the sins
  of their fathers, that they have transgressed and neglected me, and that they
  have walked perversely before me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> and
  I walked with them with a perverse mind; and I will destroy them in the land
  of their enemies: then shall their uncircumcised heart be ashamed, and then
  shall they acquiesce in the punishment of their sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And I will remember the covenant of Jacob, and
  the covenant of Isaac, and the covenant of Abraam will I remember.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And I will remember the land, and the
  land shall be left of them; then the land shall enjoy her sabbaths, when it
  is deserted through them: and they shall accept the punishment of their
  iniquities, because they neglected my judgments, and in their soul loathed my
  ordinances. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And yet not even thus,
  while they were in the land of their enemies, did I overlook them, nor did I
  loathe them so as to consume them, to break my covenant made with them; for I
  am the Lord their God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And I will
  remember their former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
  out of the house of bondage before the nation, to be their God; I am the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> These are my judgments and my
  ordinances, and the law which the Lord gave between himself and the children
  of Israel, in the mount Sina, by the hand of Moses.</p>

  <h3 id="leviticus27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak to the children of
  Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whosoever shall vow a vow as the
  valuation of his soul for the Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  the valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be his
  valuation shall be fifty didrachms of silver by the standard of the
  sanctuary. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the valuation of a
  female shall be thirty didrachms. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  if it be from five years old to twenty, the valuation of a male shall be
  twenty didrachms, and of a female ten didrachms. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And from a month old to five years old, the
  valuation of a male shall be five didrachms, and of a female, three didrachms
  of silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if from sixty year old
  and upward, if it be a male, his valuation shall be fifteen didrachms of
  silver, and if a female, ten didrachms. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if the man be too poor for the valuation, he
  shall stand before the priest; and the priest shall value him: according to
  what the man who has vowed can afford, the priest shall value him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if it be from the cattle that are
  offered as a gift to the Lord, whoever shall offer one of these to the Lord,
  it shall be holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He shall not change
  it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he do at all change it, a
  beast for a beast, it and the substitute shall be holy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And if it be any unclean beast, of which none are
  offered as a gift to the Lord, he shall set the beast before the priest.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the priest shall make a valuation
  between the good and the bad, and accordingly as the priest shall value it,
  so shall it stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if the
  worshipper will at all redeem it, he shall add the fifth part to its value.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And whatsoever man shall consecrate
  his house as holy to the Lord, the priest shall make a valuation of it
  between the good and the bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it
  stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if he that has sanctified
  it should redeem his house, he shall add to it the fifth part of the money of
  the valuation, and it shall be his. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And if a man should hallow to the Lord a part of the field of his possession,
  then the valuation shall be according to its seed, fifty didrachms of silver
  for a homer of barley. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if he
  should sanctify his field from the year of release, it shall stand according
  to his valuation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And if he should
  sanctify his field in the latter time after the release, the priest shall
  reckon to him the money for the remaining years, until the next year of
  release, and it shall be deducted as an equivalent from his full valuation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if he that sanctified the field
  would redeem it, he shall add to its value the fifth part of the money, and
  it shall be his. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And if he do not
  redeem the field, but should sell the field to another man, he shall not
  after redeem it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But the field shall
  be holy to the Lord after the release, as separated land; the priest shall
  have possession of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And if he
  should consecrate to the Lord of a field which he has bought, which is not of
  the field of his possession, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> the
  priest shall reckon to him the full valuation from the year of release, and
  he shall pay the valuation in that day as holy to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And in the year of release the land shall be
  restored to the man of whom the other bought it, whose the possession of the
  land was. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And every valuation shall
  be by holy weights: the didrachm shall be twenty oboli. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And every first-born which shall be produced
  among thy cattle shall be the Lord’s, and no man shall sanctify it: whether
  calf or sheep, it is the Lord’s. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But
  if he should redeem an unclean beast, according to its valuation, then he
  shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his; and if he redeem it not,
  it shall be sold according to its valuation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And every dedicated thing which a man shall
  dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether man or beast, or of the
  field of his possession, he shall not sell it, nor redeem it: every devoted
  thing shall be most holy to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And whatever shall be dedicated of men, shall not be ransomed, but shall be
  surely put to death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Every tithe of
  the land, both of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of trees, is the
  Lord’s, holy to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And if a
  man should at all redeem his tithe, he shall add the fifth part to it, and it
  shall be his. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And every tithe of
  oxen, and of sheep, and whatsoever may come in numbering under the rod, the
  tenth shall be holy to the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Thou
  shalt not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if thou shouldest
  at all change it, its equivalent also shall be holy, it shall not be
  redeemed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> These are the commandments
  which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sina.</p>
