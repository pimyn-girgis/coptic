  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_colossians1">1</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul, (the) apostle of Christ Jesus through the
  will of God, and Timotheos the brother, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to the saints who are in Kolassais, and faithful
  brethren who are in Christ Jesus: (the) grace to you and (the) peace from God
  our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always for you
  praying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> having heard of your faith
  which is in the Lord Jesus, and the love which is in you unto all the saints,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because of the hope which is laid up
  before you in the heavens, which ye heard before in (the) word of the truth
  of the Gospel <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This which is (won) in
  you; according as also it is in all the world, bearing fruit and growing,
  according as also in you, from the day which ye heard and ye knew the grace
  of God in [a] truth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> according as ye
  knew from Epaphra the beloved fellow servant of ours, who is a faithful
  minister of Christ for you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He (lit.
  this) who showed to us your love in the spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore we also, from the day which we heard,
  cease not praying for you and requesting, that ye might be filled with (the)
  knowledge of his will in all wisdom, and all spiritual understanding,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> walking worthily of the Lord in all
  pleasing of him in all good works, sending forth fruit, and growing in the
  knowledge of God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> being empowered
  with all power, according to (the) strength of his glory, in all patience and
  [a] longsuffering in [a] joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Giving
  thanks to the Father, he (lit. this) who made us worthy of coming into the
  portion of the lot of the saints in (the) light; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> he who saved us from (the) authority of (the)
  darkness, and he removed us into the kingdom of (the) Son of his love;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> he through whom we received the
  redemption, the forgiveness of our sins: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> who is (the) image of God, the invisible, the
  firstborn of all creation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because in
  him all things were created, those which are in the heavens and those which
  are upon (the) earth, those which are seen and those which are not seen,
  whether the thrones, or the dominions, or the governments, or the
  authorities; all things became through him, and they were created unto him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and he (it is) who is before all
  things, and all things stand in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And he is (the) head of the body of the church: who himself is the beginning
  as (Fi) firstborn from them who are dead; that he might be first in all
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Because in him the whole
  fulness was pleased to dwell [in him]; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and through him to reconcile all things unto him,
  having made them at peace through the blood of his cross; through him (or it
  '), whether the things which are upon (the) earth or the things which are in
  the heavens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And ye also once were
  being strangers (sing.) and enemies in your thoughts, in the evil works,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> but now he reconciled you in (the)
  body of his flesh through his death, to present you holy and being without
  spot and blameless before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If ye
  abide in the faith, being firmly founded, and strong, and immovable from the
  hope of the Gospel; this which ye heard; this which was proclaimed in the
  whole creation which is below (the) heaven; this to which I Paul became
  minister. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But now I rejoice in the
  pains for you, and I complete the deficiencies of the tribulations of Christ
  in my flesh for his body, which is the church; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> this to which I (pron.) became minister,
  according to the dispensation of God which is given to me unto you, to
  complete the word of God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> the mystery
  hidden since (the) age and the generations: but now it was manifested to the
  saints of his, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> to whom God wished to
  show what is the riches of (the) glory of this mystery among the Gentiles,
  which is Christ in you, the hope of (the) glory: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> he whom we (pron.) proclaim, instructing every
  man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present all men
  complete in Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> he in whom I
  toil, striving according to his working in me. in [a] power.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_colossians2">2</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For I wish you to know how great a striving I have
  for you, and them who are in Laodikia, and all who saw not my face in (the)
  flesh, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that their hearts may take
  courage, being instructed through [a] reasoning, in [a] love and all riches
  of (the) fulness of their (lit. his) understanding, unto (the) knowledge of
  the mystery of God the Father of Christ, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> he in whom (are) all the treasures of the wisdom
  and the hidden knowledge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But this I
  say, that no one may deceive you in beautiful words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For if I am not with you in (the) flesh, [but] I
  am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness
  of your faith which is in Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> As
  then ye received Christ Jesus, walk in him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> taking root, and building yourselves in him, and
  being confirmed in the faith, according as ye were instructed, abounding in
  it in [a] thanksgiving. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> See, then,
  lest by any means there is he who robbeth you through a philosophy and a
  vain. deceit, according to the traditions of the men, according to the
  elements of the world, and not according to Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> because in him dwelleth all the fulness of the
  divinity bodily, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and ye are filled
  with him, Who himself is (the) head of all government and all authority:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> he in whom ye were circumcised in a
  circumcision not made with hand, in (the) stripping off of (the) body of the
  flesh, in (the) circumcision of Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> having been buried with him in the baptism, this
  in which ye rose with him also through the faith of the working ,of God, he
  who raised him from them who are dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And ye also being dead in your transgressions and
  the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him, having
  forgiven. us all our transgressions, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  having blotted out the handwriting [this] which was being [given] against us
  in the decrees, that which was opposing us; and it (pron.) he took away from
  (the) midst, having nailed it into the cross. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Having stripped from himself the governments and
  the authorities, having defamed them openly, having made them a spectacle in
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Let not any one then judge you in
  [an] eating and [a] drinking, or in respect (lit. a part) of a feast, or a
  first day (of month), or of sabbaths: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  which is (the) shadow of the things which come. But the body of Christ
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> let not any one overcome you in it,
  wishing in a humbleness of heart and a service of the angels: he took his
  stands on the things which he saw, being proud without cause by (the) heart
  of his flesh, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and he layeth not hold
  on the head from whom is the whole body, being supplied through the joints
  and the bonds, and being generated it will grow in the growth of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If ye died with Christ from the
  elements of the world, why reckon ye yourselves as those a living in the
  world? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Take not, nor taste, nor
  approach <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> to all things which are for
  (the) destruction, so as not to use them: according to the orders and the
  teaching of [the] men; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> which are
  things in which there is a show indeed of [a] wisdom in (the) wish of a
  service, and a humbleness of heart, and an unsparingness of (e) the body, not
  in [an] honour, in [a] satisfying of (the) flesh.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_colossians3">3</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> If then ye rose with Christ, seek for the things
  above the place in which Christ was, sitting on the right hand of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Think of the things above, not those
  which are upon (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For ye
  died, and your life (is) hidden with Christ in God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If Christ should be manifested, your life, then ye
  also are being manifested with him in [a] glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Kill your members which are upon the earth; [the]
  fornication, [the] uncleanness, [the] passion, [the] evil desire, and the
  wrongdoing, which is the idolatry; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> the
  things because of which cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the
  disobedience; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> these in which ye also
  were walking once when living in these. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But now put away (lit. down) also everything,
  [the] anger, [the] wrath, [the] malice, [the] blasphemy; [the] empty words
  let them not come from your mouth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> say
  not falsehood to one another; Having stripped from you the old man with his
  doing, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and ye clothed you with the
  new man, he who will become new in [a] knowledge, according to (the) image of
  him who created him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> the place in
  which there is not Greek and a Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision,
  barbarian, Skythos, servant, and freeman: but (a.) all things in all, Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Clothe you then as chosen of God,
  holy and beloved, with tender mercies of [a] compassion, [a] kindness, [a]
  humbleness of heart, [a] meekness, [a] longsuffering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Bearing with one another, and forgiving one
  another, if there is a quarrel between one and another (lit. one); according
  as Christ' forgave you, thus ye also: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  but upon all these things [the] love which is the girdle of [the]
  completeness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the peace of Christ
  let it he established in your hearts, this unto which ye were called in one
  body; And be ye thankful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The word of
  the Lord let it dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and instructing
  yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, praising God in your
  hearts in thanksgiving. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And all
  things which ye will do in (the) word or in (the) work, (do) all things in
  (the) name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father through
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> [The] wives be subject to your
  husbands, as it is worthy in the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> [The] men, love your wives, and be not angry
  against them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> [The] children, obey
  your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> [The] fathers, anger not your children, that they
  may not be grieved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> [The] servants,
  obey your masters according to flesh in all things; not with an eyeservice,
  as pleasers of [the] men, but in [a] singleness of your heart, as fearing the
  Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that which ye will do, from
  your soul work, as doing (it) to the Lord, and not man; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> knowing that ye will receive (the) retribution of
  the inheritance from the Lord: be servants of Christ Jesus our Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For he who doeth wrong will receive
  his wrongdoing which he did; and there is not regard of persons with him.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_colossians4">4</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> [The] masters give (lit. do) a just judgement and
  be fair with your servants, knowing that your Master also is in the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Be continuing in the prayer, watching
  in it in [a] thanksgiving; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> praying
  therewith also for us indeed, that God may open to us a door of the word, to
  speak the mystery of Christ, this because of which I am bound; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that I may manifest it according as it is worthy
  that I should speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Walk in [a]
  wisdom toward them who are outside, buying the time: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> your word always in [a] grace, seasoned in [a]
  salt, to know how it is worthy for you to answer each one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> All the things which happen to me Tichikos shall
  show them to you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow
  servant in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He whom I sent to
  you unto this work, that he may know your state, and comfort your hearts;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> with Onēsimos the faithful and beloved
  brother, he who is one of you. They shall show to you all things which are
  here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Saluteth you Aristarchos my
  fellow captive, and Markos (the) cousin of Barnabas, he concerning whom ye
  received commandment; if he should come to you, receive him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and Jēsous who is called 'Joustos.' These who are
  from (the) circumcision; these only shared in working unto the kingdom of
  God; these who became comfort to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Saluteth you Epaphras, who is one of you, (the) servant of Christ Jesus; he
  who striveth always for you in his prayers, that ye may stand complete and
  full in the will of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For I
  witness of him, that he hath a great grief for you, and them who are in
  Laodikia, and them who are in Jerapolis. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Saluteth you Loukas the beloved physician, and
  Dēmas. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Salute the brethren who are in
  Laodikia and Nimphan, and the church of their house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if this epistle should be read with you, let
  it be read in the church of Laodikia, and (the epistle) from Laodikia (see)
  that ye (pron.) may read it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And say
  to Archēppos: 'Look forth to the ministry which thou receivedst in the Lord,
  that thou fill it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> My salutation, in
  my own hand, Paul. Remember my bonds. (The) grace with you.
