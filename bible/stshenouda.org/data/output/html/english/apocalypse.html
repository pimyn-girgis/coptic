  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The revelation of Jesus Christ,
  which God gave to him, to show to his servants the things which must happen
  quickly: and he signified them. Having sent them through his angel to his
  servant Iōnnēs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He who witnessed to
  the word of God, and the witness of Jesus Christ, to the things which he saw.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Blessed are they who read, and they
  who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things which are
  written on it: for the time approached. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Iōannēs to the seven churches which are in [the]
  Asia: (the) grace to you and [the] peace from him who is, and who was being,
  and who cometh; And from the seven spirits which are before the throne;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And from Jesus Christ the witness, the
  faithful, the firstborn of .the dead, and (the) ruler of all the kings of
  (the) earth. He who loved us, and he washed us from our sins in his blood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he made us a kingdom of priesthood
  to God his Father; whose is the glory and the might for ever. Amēn.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Lo, he it is who cometh with the
  clouds; and they all shall see him --every eye, and they who pierced him; and
  they all shall see him--the tribes of (the) earth. Amēn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I am the alpha and the ō(mega), the beginning and
  the end: Saith the Lord God, he who is, he who was being, and he who cometh,
  the Almighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I am Iōannēs your
  brother, and your partner in the tribulations, because the kingdom and thy
  endurance were in Jesus. I was being in the island, which is called 'Pathmō,'
  because of the word of God and the witness of Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I was being in a spirit in the day of the
  Kyriakē. And I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying to me:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The things which thou wilt hear write
  on a book, send them to the seven churches which are [in] the Asia, That is
  to say Ephesos, and Smyrna, and Pergamōn, and Thyatēra, and Sardis, and
  Philadelphia, and Laodikia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I
  turned myself, I saw the voice which was speaking to me. And having turned
  myself, I saw seven lampstands of gold; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and in (the) midst of the lampstands a likeness
  of a son of man, being clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt upon
  his breasts with a girdle of gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  But his head and his hair being white as [a] white wool, and [a] snow; and
  his eyes are as a flame of fire; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and
  his feet as [a] burnished brass, being refined in a fire; and his voice as
  (the) voice of many waters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> There
  were seven stars in his right hand: and a sword of two edges coining from his
  mouth; and his face shining as (the) sun in his power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And when I saw him, I cast myself down before his
  feet; and I was as one dead. And he placed his right hand upon me, saying:
  Fear not, I am the first and the last, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> he who liveth; and I died, and lo, I live unto
  age of the age, and the keys of (the) death were being with me and (of)
  Amenti. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Write then the things which
  thou wilt see, they (pron.) which will happen after these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The mystery of the seven stars, which
  thou sawest on my right hand, and the seven lampstands of gold. The seven
  stars are the seven angels of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands
  which thou sawest are seven churches.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Write to the angel of the church of
  Ephesos: These are the things which he saith, in whose right hand are the
  seven stars, he who walketh in (the) midst of the seven lampstands of gold:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> "I know thy works, and thy toils and
  thine endurance, that it is not possible for thee to bear an evil (one). And
  thou triedst some who say of themselves, that they are apostles, and they are
  not such (lit. some), and they were found being false apostles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And [an] endurance thou hast, and thou didst bear
  with these because of my name, and thou wast not weary. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But I have against thee, that thou didst leave thy
  first love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Remember then how thou
  didst fall, and repent; otherwise I come to thee, and move thy lampstand from
  its place, unless thou repent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  this thou hast, that thou hatedst the works of the Nikolaitēs, those which I
  also hate." <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He who hath ear to hear,
  let him hear what it is which the spirit saith to the churches: He who will
  overcome, I shall give to him that he may eat from the tree of (the) life
  which is in the midst of the Paradise of my God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Write to the angel of the church of Smyrna: These
  are the things which saith the first and the last, he who died and he lived:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> "I know thy tribulation and thy
  poverty; but thou (art) rich. And I found not one from those who say of
  themselves that they are Jews, being not such (lit. some), but being a
  synagogue of Satan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Fear not the
  pains which thou wilt receive: behold, the devil will cast some from you to
  the prison, that ye may be tried and afflicted for ten days. Be thou faithful
  even unto (the) death, and I shall (lit. will) give to thee the crown of
  (the) life." <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He who hath ear to hear,
  let him hear what it is which the spirit saith to the churches. For to him,
  who will overcome, shall not be done violence (by) the second death.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Write to the angel of the church of
  Pergamōs: 'These are the things which he saith who hath the sword which
  striketh with two edges: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> "I know
  where thon dwelledst, the place in which is the throne of Satan: and thou
  laidest hold on my name and deniedst not my faith. And in the days thou
  opposedst the martyr the faithful, he whom they killed with you, the place in
  which Satan dwelleth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But I have a
  few names also against thee who lay hold on (the) teaching of Balaam; He who
  taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before (the) sons of Israel, to eat
  (things) slain for idols, and to commit fornication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thus thou also hast (one who) is laying hold on
  (the) teaching of the Nikolaitēs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Repent then: and I come to thee quickly; and I fight with them with the sword
  of my mouth." <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He who hath ear to
  hear, let him hear what it is which the spirit saith to the churches. For he
  who will overcome, I shall give to him from the hidden manna; and I shall
  give to him a white stone, And in the stone being a new name written [upon
  it]: no one saw it except him who received it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Write to the angel of the church of Thyatēra:
  These are the things which saith (the) Son of God, He whose eyes are as a
  flame of fire, and his feet as [a] burnished brass: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> "I know thy works, and thy love and thy faith and
  thy ministry and thy patience, and thy last works which are greater than the
  first. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But I have against thee, that
  thou allowedst the woman Iezabel,' who saith, that she is (lit. I am) a
  prophet and teacher; and is leading astray my servants to commit fornication,
  and to eat from the things slain for idols. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I gave a time to her, that she might repent;
  and she wisheth not to repent of her fornication. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Lo, I will put (lit. give) her into (the) bed,
  and them who commit adultery with her, into a great tribulation: unless she
  repent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I shall (lit, will) kill her
  sons with (the) death. And all the churches shall know, that I am he who
  searcheth the hearts and the reins; and I am giving to each one according to
  his works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But to you (pron.) I say,
  namely (the) rest of them who are in Thyatēra, they who have not this
  teaching, who knew not (the) depth of Satan, as they say;-- I shall (lit.
  will) not cast another burden upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But that which ye have, lay hold on it until I
  come. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he who will overcome, and
  who will keep my works unto the end (lit. out), I shall give to him an
  authority over the nations: <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he
  shall rule them with a staff of iron; as a potter's vessel he shall crush
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> As I also received from my
  Father; and I shall give to him the star which riseth in the morning."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> He who hath ear to hear, let him hoar
  what it is which the spirit saith to the churches.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Write to the angel of the church of
  Sardis: These are the things which he saith who hath the seven spirits of
  God, and the seven stars: "I know thy works, that thou hast a name of the
  health that thou art alive: and thou art dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Be thou then watchful, and confirm (the)
  remainder; otherwise thou wilt die: because I found not thy works fulfilled
  with my God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Remember thenhow thou
  reccivedst and thou heardest; and keep, and repent. Unless then thou repent
  and watch I shall (lit. will) come as a thief, and thou wilt not know the
  hour in which I come upon thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Bu I
  have a few names in Sardis, these which polluted not their garments with
  woman: and they shall walk with me in white garments; for they are worthy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He who will overcome thus, they shall
  clothe him with white vestures; and they shall not blot out their name from
  the book of (the) life: I shall confess their name before my Father, and
  before his angels." <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He who hath ear to
  hear, let him hear what it is which the spirit saith to the churches.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Write to the angel of the church of
  Philadelphia: These are the things which saith the holy, the true, he who
  hath the keys of (the) house of David, he who will open, no one will shut;
  and should he shut, no one will open : <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  "I know thy works and thy faith, behold, I set (lit. gave) before thee an
  opened door; it is not possible that any should shut it; because thou hast a
  little power, and thou keptest my word, and thou deniedst not my name.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Lo, I will give to thee from the
  synagogue of Satan them who say that they are Jews, and they are not such
  (lit. some), but they say falsehood. Lo, I shall cause them to come, and I
  shall cause them to worship thee; and they shall cast themselves down before
  thy feet; and all shall know that it is I who loved thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because thou keptest my word and my patience,
  therefore I also kept thee from the trial, which will come upon the whole
  multitude, to try all who are upon (the) earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I come quickly: lay hold on that which thou hast,
  that no one take thy crown. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He who
  will overcome, I shall make him pillar in (the) house of my God, and he shall
  not come out any more. And I shall write (the) name of my God upon him, and
  (the) name of the new city of my Father, Jerusalem which cometh down out of
  (the) heaven from my God, and my new name." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He who hath ear to hear, let him hear what it is
  which the spirit saith to the churches.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Write to the angel of the church of Laodikia:
  'These are the things which saith the Amēn, the witness, the faithful and the
  true, (the) beginning of the creation of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> "I know thy works, that neither art thou cold,
  nor art thou hot. Would that thou wert being as cold water or thou wert
  boiling. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because thus thou art as
  water lukewarm, neither art thou as hot water, nor as cold water, therefore I
  will, vomit thee out of my heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Because thou sayest, that I (am) rich, and I have need of nothing; and thou
  knowest not that thou (art) weak and miserable, and thou (art) a poor and
  blind beggar, being naked: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I counsel
  thee then to buy [a] gold from me, refined in [a] fire, that thou mayest
  become rich; And clothe thyself with splendid garments, that (the) shame of
  thy nakedness be not manifested; and give eyesalve to thine eyes, that thou
  mayest see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For I--them whom I love I
  reprove, I chasten them. Be zealous then for the good, and repent.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For lo, I stand at the door, and I
  knock: he who will hear and open the door to me, I shall (lit. will) go in
  with him, and eat with him, and he with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For he who will overcome I shall (lit. will) give
  to him to sit with me on my throne, as I overcame, and I sat with my Father
  on his throne." <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He who hath ear to
  hear, let him hear what it is which the spirit saith to the churches.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But after these (things) I saw.
  Behold, a door being opened in (the) heaven, and the first voice, which was
  speaking to rne, which I heard as (the) voice of a trumpet speaking to me,
  saying: 'Come up hither, and let me show to thee the things which will happen
  after these.' And <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I became in the
  spirit: and I saw. Behold a throne, being in (the) heaven, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and he who sat on (the) throne was being in light
  of iaspis and a sardinos: and the iris encircling the throne being of light
  of smarakdos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And there are
  twenty-four thrones set around the throne, and twenty-four presbyters sitting
  upon the thrones, clad in white vestures and crowns of gold upon their heads.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And were coming from the throne
  lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven lamps of fire encircling the
  throne, which are the seven spirits of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And there is before the throne as a sea of glass
  being like to a christalos. And in (the) midst of the throne there are four
  living-beings full of eyes before and behind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the first living-being like to a lion, and the
  second living-being like to a calf, and the third living-being like to (the)
  face of a son of man, and the fourth living-being like to an eagle flying.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And each one of them--all over them,
  from their claws inside of them,' being full of eyes. And they were resting
  themselves not in the day and the night, saying: 'Is holy, is holy, is holy
  the Lord God, the Almighty, he who is, and he who was being, and he who
  cometh.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And if the four living-beings
  should give this glory and this honour and this thanksgiving to him who
  sitteth upon the throne, he who liveth unto age of the age, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Fall down upon their face the twenty-four
  presbyters, and they worship before him who liveth unto age of the age. And
  they lay their crowns down before the throne, saying : <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> 'Thou (art he) who is worthy, the Lord our God,
  to receive the glory and the honour and the power. Because thou (pron.)
  createdst all things, and thy will was done, and they were created.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I saw on the right hand of him
  who sat upon the throne a book written inside and outside of it), and sealed
  with seven seals. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I saw a strong
  angel proclaiming in a great voice: 'Who is worthy to open this book, and
  open its seals?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And no one was able
  in (the) heaven nor upon (the) earth nor below (the) earth to open the book,
  nor to see it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they all were
  weeping, because no one was worthy to open the book, nor to see it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And one from the presbyters came to
  me, he said to me: 'Weep not. Lo, the lion from (the) tribe of Iouda, from
  (the) root of David, overcame to open the book and its seals.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I saw in (the) midst of the throne and the
  four living-beings, and in (the) midst of the presbyters, a lamb standing,
  slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits
  of God which were sent down upon all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he came, he took away the book from (the)
  right hand of him who sat upon the throne. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he having taken the book, the four
  living-beings and the twenty-four presbyters threw themselves down before the
  lamb, Having each of them a harp, and vials of gold full of incense, which
  (are) the prayers of the saints. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  they were praising in a new song, saying: 'Thou art worthy to take the book,
  and to open its seals: because thou wast slaughtered, and thou bought us for
  God in thy blood from every tribe and every tongue and every nation and every
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou madest them for our
  God a kingdom and priests; and they shall reign upon the earth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I saw, and I heard (the) voice of many angels
  around the throne and the living-beings and the presbyters; and their number
  was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Saying in a great sound: Worthy is the lamb who
  was slaughtered to take the power and the kingdom and the wisdom, and the
  honour and the glory and the blessing.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And every creature which is in (the) heaven and
  upon (the) earth, and those which arc in the sea, and all those which are in
  them- [And] I heard them saying to him who sitteth upon the throne: 'The
  blessing is thine and the glory and the honour and the strength unto age of
  the ages.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the four living-beings
  are saying: Amen.' And the presbyters threw themselves upon their face, they
  worshipped.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these (things) I saw, when
  the lamb opened one of the seals: I heard one of the four living-beings
  saying as (the) voice of a thunder: Come.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I saw. Behold, a white horse, and he who sat
  upon it, having a bow: and a crown was given to him. He came forth
  conquering, and he conquered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he
  having opened the second seal, I heard the second living-being saying: Come.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I saw. A horse of colour of fire
  all (over) came forth. And to him who sat upon it was given to take away the
  peace from all (the) earth; that they might slaughter one another: and a
  great sword was given to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he
  having opened the third seal, I saw the third living-being saying: 'Come.'
  And I saw. Behold, a black horse; and he who sat upon it having a balance in
  his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I heard a harsh voice in
  (the) midst of the four living-beings as (the) voice of an eagle, saying: A
  measure of wheat for a stater, and three measures of barley for a stater; but
  the oil and the wine hurt them not.' ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And he having opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living-being saying:
  'Come.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I saw. Behold, a grey
  horse; and he who sat upon it, his name is (the) death; and all Amenti
  drawing after him. And authority was given to him over the fourth part of
  (the) earth, to kill them with (the) sword and the famine and the tribulation
  and the wild beasts of (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And he having opened the fifth seal, I saw below the altar the souls of the
  men who were slaughtered because of the word of God, and the witness which
  they were having. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they cried in a
  great voice, saying: 'How long yet, our Master, he who is holy, the true,
  judgest thou not and takest vengeance for our blood from them who dwell upon
  (the) earth?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And to each of them was
  given a white robe; and it was said to them, that they should rest themselves
  yet a little time, until were fulfilled their fellow servants and their
  brethren who will be killed also like them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, a great
  earthquake happened; and (the) sun was blackened as a sackcloth of hair; and
  all the moon became blood; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the
  stars shook down from (the) heaven upon the earth as a fig-tree (when) a
  great wind shakes (down) her unripe figs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And (the) heaven is being rolled up as a scroll;
  and every mountain and every island were moved from their place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And all the kings of (the) earth and the
  chiliarchs and the rich and the strong and every servant and all the freemen
  bid themselves in the caves and the holes of the rocks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they say to the rocks and the mountains: Fall
  upon us, and hide us from (the) face of him who sitteth upon the throne, and
  from before the anger of the lamb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Because the great day of his anger came. For whom is it possible to stand
  before him?'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But after these (things) I saw four
  angels standing upon the four corners of (the) earth, laying hold on the four
  winds, that the winds might not blow upon (the) earth, nor upon the sea, nor
  upon the rivers, nor upon the trees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And I looked, I saw another angel having come from the places of rising of
  (the) sun, having a seal of the living God. And he cried out in a great shout
  towards the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> saying to them: 'Hurt not the earth
  and the sea and the trees, until ye seal the servants of God in their
  forehead.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I heard (the) number of
  them who were scaled in their forehead, an hundred forty four thousand, they
  who were sealed from all the tribes of (the) sons of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> From (the) tribe of louda twelve thousand. From
  (the) tribe of Roubēn twelve thousand. From (the) tribe of Gad twelve
  thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> From (the) tribe of
  Ephthalim twelve thousand. From (the) tribe of Dan twelve thousand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> From (the) tribe of Symeōn twelve
  thousand. From (the) tribe of Levi twelve thousand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> From (the) tribe of Isachar twelve thousand. From
  (the) tribe of Zaboulōn twelve thousand. From (the) tribe of Assēr twelve
  thousand. From (the) tribe of Iōsēph twelve thousand. From (the) tribe of
  Benjamin twelve thousand who were sealed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And after these (things) I saw a great multitude;
  it is not possible for any one to number it, from every nation and every
  tribe and every people and every tongue, standing (plug.) before the throne
  and before the lamb, vested in white robes, having (lit. being) harps in
  their hands; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Crying out in a great
  voice, saying: The salvation is of our God, he who sitteth upon the throne,
  and (of) the lamb.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all the
  angels were standing before the throne and the presbyters and the four
  living-beings; And they threw themselves down upon their face before the
  throne, and they worshipped God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  saying: 'Amēn. The blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the
  thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power are of (tta.) our God unto age of
  the age. Amēn.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And one from the
  presbyters answered, he said to me: Who are these who are clothed with these
  white garments, and whence came they ?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I said to him: 'Lord, thou (art he) who knoweth
  them.' And he said to me: 'These are they who come from the great
  tribulations, and they washed their robes and made them glorious in the blood
  of the lamb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Therefore they are
  before the throne of God; and they serve him in his temple, in the day and
  the night: and he who sitteth upon the throne shall overshadow them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They shall not hunger, nor shall they
  thirst any more, neither shall they toil, neither shall shadow come over
  them, nor any (lit. every) heat: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Because the lamb which is before the throne himself is walking with them, and
  he shall guide them unto (exert) the fountain of water of life: and God shall
  wipe every tear from their eyes.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And he having opened the seventh
  seal, a sound was made in (the) heaven unto an hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I saw the seven angels who were before God,
  standing; and seven trumpets were given to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And another angel came; he stood by the altar,
  having a censer of gold: and much incense was given to him, that he might
  give it (plur.) along with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden
  altar, that which was before the throne. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of all
  the saints went up from (the) hand of the angel, he who was before God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the angel took the censer of gold,
  he filled it with the fire of the altar, and he cast it down upon the earth;
  and there happened thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the seven angels, they who had the
  seven trumpets, prepared themselves that they might sound. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the first angel sounded, and there happened a
  hail (lit. stone) and a fire mingled in the blood, and they were cast upon
  the earth. And (the) third part of the earth was burnt, and (the) third part
  of the trees, and it burnt all green grass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the second angel sounded: as (it were) a great
  mountain of fire burning was cast down to the sea. And (the) third part of
  the sea became. blood; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and (the) third
  part of all the creatures which were in the sea died, those in which there
  was soul of life; and (the) third part of the ships perished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the third angel sounded, and a great star,
  burning as a torch of fire, fell down from (the) heaven. And it fell on (the)
  third part of the rivers, and the fountains of water; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and (the) name of the star is called Apsinthion.
  And (the) third part of the waters became bitter as an alloē; and many of the
  men died of the waters, because they became bitter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the fourth angel sounded, and (the) third
  part of the sun was struck, and (the) third part of the moon, and (the) third
  part of the stars; that they might become dark, and that their third part
  might not shine in the day and the night. Thus also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I saw, and I heard an eagle in (the) midst of
  (the) heaven, crying out in a great voice, saying: 'Woe, woe, woe, to them
  who dwell upon the earth, from (the) remainder of the voices of the three
  angels, they who will sound!'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the fifth angel sounded, and I
  saw a star fallen from (the) heaven upon the earth: and they gave to him the
  keys of the pit of (the) abyss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  the smoke of the pit went up as (the) smoke of a great furnace. And (the) sun
  and the air became dark from the smoke of the pit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And locusts came upon the earth from the smoke;
  and authority was given to them, as the scorpions who have authority upon
  (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it was said to them
  not to hurt the herbage (plur.) of (the) earth, nor every tree, nor every
  green thing, except the men on whose forehead was not the seal of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And it was given to them that they
  should not kill them, but that they might give pain to them five months; and
  the pain of their torment shall become painful as the torment of scorpions,
  if they should sting a man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And in
  those days the men shall seek for (the) death, and they shall not find it:
  they shall desire (the) death, and (the) death shall flee from them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And (the) form of those locusts--they
  are being like to the horses prepared for (the) war, having (lit. being) a
  crown put (lit. given) upon (the) head of each of them, being of colour of
  gold. And their face is being like to (the) face of men; and their teeth
  being like [as] to those of the lions; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  and their hair being like to that of the women; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and their wings as breastplates of iron. And the
  sound of their wings as (the) sound of chariots of horses prepared for (the)
  war. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there are tails to them as
  the scorpions, and stings; and their authority is being in their tail to hurt
  the men five months. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> (The) king is
  being over them, the angel of (the) abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Magedon,
  which they interpret in Greek, He who destroyeth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The first woe passed: behold is coming the second
  woo. After these things <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> the sixth
  angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the altar of gold which
  is before the throne of God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> saying
  to the sixth angel, he who had the trumpet: 'Loose the four angels, who are
  prepared for the hour and the day and the month and the year, that they might
  kill (the) third part of the men.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Omitted <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And (the) number of the army
  of the horsemen was twice a ten thousand of ten thousands. I heard their
  number <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> thus. And I saw the horses in
  the vision, and those who sit upon them, clothed with breastplates of fire
  and a hyakinthinon and sulphur (plur.): and (the) head of the horses as (the)
  head of lions. But coming from their mouths are [a] fire and [a] smoke and
  [a] sulphur. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And from these three
  plagues died (the) third part of the men, from the fire and the smoke and the
  sulphur, those which come from their mouths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For (the) authority of the horses was being in
  their mouths and their tail: for their tail was being like to serpents having
  heads. And in this they were hurting the men five months. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And (the) remainder of the men died not in these
  plagues, nor did they repent from the works of their hands, that they should
  not worship the demons, and the idols, The gold and the silver and the brass
  and the wood and the stone, for which it is not possible to see, nor to hear,
  nor to walk. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they repented not
  from their murders, nor from their magic potions, nor from their fornications
  and their defilements, nor from their thefts.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I saw another strong angel, who
  came from (the) heaven clothed with a cloud; and the iris being upon his
  head; and his face being as (the) sun; and his feet being as pillars of fire;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and there is a book in his hand. And
  he put his right foot upon the sea, his left upon the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he cried out in a great voice, as a lion
  roaring: and he having cried out, the seven thunders gave their voice.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Aud I heard the things which the seven
  thunders said; I was about to write them also. And I heard a voice from (the)
  heaven, saying to me: Seal them, write not the things which the seven
  thunders spake.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the angel whom I
  saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth stretched his right hand up to
  (the) heaven, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and he sware by him who
  liveth unto age of the age; He who created (the) heaven and the earth and the
  sea and all things which are: That time shall be no longer; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> in the day of the voice of the seventh angel,
  should he sound. For the mystery of God was completed as he proclaimed
  through his servants the prophets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  the voice which I heard from (the) heaven was speaking to me, saying: 'Go,
  take the open book, that which is in (the) hand of the angel, who standeth
  upon the sea and upon the earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  I went unto the angel; I said to him: Give the book to me.' And he said to
  me: Take it to thee; and it shall make thy belly bitter, and it shall be
  sweet in thy mouth as [a] honey.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  I took the book from (the) hand of the angel; and it was sweet in my mouth as
  [a] honey: and having eaten it my belly was bitter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they said to me: Thou must also prophesy over
  peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And they gave a reed of gold to me,
  being a staff, saying to me: 'Rise, measure the temple of God, and the altar,
  and them who worship in it; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and the
  court which is outside of the temple leave (lit. cast) it out, measure it
  not; because it was given to the nations, and the holy city; they shall
  trample in it forty-two months: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I
  shall give to my two witnesses: they shall prophesy a thousand, two hundred
  and sixty days, clothed with sackcloth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> These are the two olive-trees and the two
  lampstands, which are standing before the Lord: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and that which they wish they (pron.) shall do. A
  fire shall come from their mouth; it shall eat up their enemies: and he who
  wisheth to hurt them, thus shall be killed (plur.). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Because they have authority to shut (the) heaven,
  that the rain may not come upon the earth all the days of their prophecy. And
  they have authority also over the waters, to cause them to turn and become
  blood; and to smite (the) earth with every plague which they (pron.) wish.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if they should complete the
  witness of their prophecy: [But] the wild beast which cometh up from (the)
  abyss shall make a war with them, and he shall overcome them, he shall kill
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And their body shall be on the
  street of the great city which is called spiritually "Sodoma of Khēmi," the
  place in which their Lord was crucified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they shall see their body (they) of every
  tribe and every people and every tongue and every nation, they shall look
  upon their bodies three days and a half; and they shall not let any lay their
  bodies in the sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they all
  shall rejoice who dwell upon the earth over them, and they shall be
  delighted. And they shall send gifts to one another, saying: "These are the
  two prophets who tormented them who dwell upon the earth." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it shall come to pass after three days and a
  half, and a spirit of God shall go into them, and they shall stand upon their
  feet, and a great fear shall come upon them who see them.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I heard a great voice from (the) heaven,
  saying to them: Come up hither.' And they went up to (the) heaven in a cloud;
  and their enemies shall see them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  in that hour shall be a great earthquake. And the third part of the city
  fell; and seven thousand of names of men died in the earthquake; and (the)
  remainder were full of fear, and they glorified the God of (the) heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The second woe passed; and behold,
  the third woe cometh quickly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the
  seventh angel sounded; and great voices came from (the) heaven, saying: (The)
  kingdom of the world became of the Lord our God, and his Christ: and he shall
  reign unto age of the age.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  twenty-four presbyters who are before God, sitting upon the thrones, threw
  themselves upon their face, they worshipped God, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> saying: We give thanks to thee, Lord God, the
  Almighty, he who is, and he who was being, and thou comest, Because thou
  tookest the power, and thou reignedst. <span style=

  who fear thy name; the small and the great; thou shalt destroy them who
  destroy the earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the temple of
  God was opened in (the) heaven; and the ark of the covenant appeared in the
  temple; and there happened lightnings and thunders and voices and earthquakes
  and stones of heaven.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And behold, a great sign manifested
  itself in (the) heaven. A woman arrayed with (the) sun, and the moon below
  her feet, a crown being put (lit. given) on her head of twelve stars:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and being with child, crying out,
  travailing, being in pain, about to bring forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And another sign manifested itself in (the)
  heaven; and lo, a dragon of colour of fire, it is very great, having (lit.
  being to him) seven heads and ten horns, there being seven crowns upon his
  heads: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and his tail dragged away (the)
  third part of the stars of (the) heaven and it cast them down upon (the)
  earth. And the dragon stood before the woman, that, if she should bring forth
  the son, the dragon might swallow him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And she brought forth the son: this is he who will rule the nations with a
  staff of iron. And the child was carried away up to God, and to his throne.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the woman fled to (the) desert, to
  the place which God prepared for her, that they might nourish her there a
  thousand and two hundred (and) ninety days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And a great war took place in (the) heaven:
  Michaēl and his angels to war against the dragon. And the dragon warred
  against them and his angels; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and he
  prevailed not against them in fighting them: and they put not place for him
  any more up in (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the
  dragon was cast (out), the great serpent, (the) ancient, he who is called the
  devil Satan, he who led astray the whole world; he was cast below the earth:
  his angels also were cast below with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I heard a great voice up in (the) heaven,
  saying: 'Now happened the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our
  God, and the authority of his Christ. Because the accuser of our brethren was
  cast to the earth, he who accused before God in the day and the night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Because they (pron.) overcame him
  because of (the) blood of the lamb, and because of (the) blood of their

  they who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea: because the devil came
  below to you, there being a great wrath in him; knowing that only a little
  while (it is) which he hath.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the
  dragon, having seen that he was cast to (the) earth, pursued the woman who
  brought forth the son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And two great
  wings were given to her as those of an eagle, that the woman might fly to
  (the) desert, to (the) place (in) which she will be nourished a time and
  times and (the) half of a time from (the) face of the serpent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the serpent cast from his mouth as (it were)
  a river of water behind the woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And (the) earth opened its mouth, it swallowed the river of water which the
  dragon cast forth behind the woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And the dragon was angry with the woman, and went to make a war with (the)
  remainder of (the) seed of the woman, they who keep the commandments of God
  and the witness of Jesus.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I stood upon the sand of the
  sea; I saw a wild beast coming up in the sea, there being ten horns upon him,
  and seven heads, there being four crowns upon his horns, there being a name
  written on his heads. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the wild
  beast which I saw was being like to a leopard, and his feet being as those of
  a bear, his mouth being like to a mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave his
  power to him, and his throne, and a great authority. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And there is being a wound on his heads as of a
  slaughtering of (the) death, and the wound of his death was healed. And all
  (the) earth wondered behind the wild beast; <span style=

  like to this wild beast? And who (is he) for whom it is possible to war with
  him?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And a mouth was given to him to
  say great blasphemies, and authority was given to him to war forty-two
  months. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he opened his mouth to
  blaspheme God, and to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them who
  dwell in (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it was
  given to him to make a war with the saints, and to overcome them. And
  authority was given to him over all the tribes, and every tongue, and every
  nation: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and they all shall worship
  him, they who dwell upon (the) earth, they whose name is not written on (the)
  book of (the) life of the lamb, he who was slaughtered from (the) foundation
  of the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He who hath ear to hear,
  let him hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He who will go in a
  captivity, let him go. He who will kill with (the) sword, they will kill him
  with the sword. But he who hath [the] patience and [the] faith of the saints,
  blessed is he. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I saw another wild
  beast coming up from (the) earth, there were being two horns upon him, being
  like to a lamb, and speaking as a dragon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> All his authority was as the first wild beast; he
  was doing it before him. And he caused (the) earth and them who dwell on it
  (to) worship the first wild beast, whose wound of his death was cured.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he shall do signs, that he may
  cause a fire to come down from (the) heaven' upon (the) earth before [the]
  men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he shall lead astray them
  who dwell upon (the) earth because of the signs which were given to him,
  having done them before the wild beast. Saying to them who dwell upon the
  earth, that they should make image to the wild beast, in whom is (the) wound
  of (the) sword, and he lived. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> It was
  given to him to give spirit to the image of the wild beast, and to kill them
  who will not worship the wild beast and his image. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he shall cause all the small, and the great,
  and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants-he shall mark
  them in their right hand and their forehead; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> That no one shall be able to buy or to sell
  except him on whom there is mark of the wild beast put (lit. given), or his
  name, or (the) number of his name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  The wisdom (is) here. He who hath mind let him reckon (the) number of the
  wild beast; for it is (the) number of a man: and his number is six hundred
  and sixty-six.</p>

  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And another, second, angel walked after him,
  saying: Babylon the great fell: from (the) wine of (the) wrath of her
  fornication all the nations fell.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  another, third, angel walked after them, saying: 'He who will worship the
  wild beast and his image, and will seal himself on his forehead or his hand-
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he (it is) who will drink from the
  wine of (the) wrath of God, which is mingled, unmixed wine in the cup of his
  anger. And they shall be tormented in [a] fire and [a] sulphur before the
  angels, and before the lamb: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and the
  smoke of their torment shall go up for ever. Because there is not rest there
  in the day and the night for them who will worship the wild beast, and his
  image, and who will receive the mark of his name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But he who will endure with the saints, they (are
  they) who will keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus Christ.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I heard another great sound from
  (the) heaven, saying: Blessed are the dead in the Lord, should they rise
  henceforth. The spirit saith that they may rest themselves, henceforth from
  their toils of their works, (which) shall follow (lit. walk after) them; and
  that he may guide them down to a fountain of water of life.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I saw a white cloud; and above upon the cloud
  one is sitting, being like to a son of man, there being a crown of gold upon
  him, there being a sharp sword in his hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And another angel came from the temple, crying
  out in a great sound, saying to him who sat upon the cloud: Send thy reaping
  (hook) and reap; because the hour of (the) reaping of the earth came.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he who sat upon the cloud sent
  his reaping (hook) upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And (there was) another angel who came from (the) heaven having a sharp
  sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And another angel came from
  the altar having an authority over (lit. of a) fire. And he called in a great
  sound to him who had the sharp sword, saying: Send thy sharp sword and gather
  the cluster of vine of (the) earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And the angel struck his sword into the earth, and he gathered the vine of
  (the) earth, and he cast it into the great winepress of (the) wrath of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he trode the winepress outside of
  the city; and a blood came out of the winepress unto the bridles of the
  horses, a thousand and six hundred stadia.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I saw another great sign up in
  (the) heaven, being wonderful; seven angels having the seven last plagues;
  because in them was completed the wrath of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I saw as (it were) a sea of glass mingled with
  a fire; and all they who overcame the wild beast, and his image, and (the)
  number of his name, standing upon the sea of glass having harps of God:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Singing the song of the lamb and
  Mōyses the servant of God, saying: 'Great are thy works and they are
  wonderful, Lord God, the Almighty, the righteous. All thy ways are truth,
  (the) king of the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Who (is he)
  who shall not fear thee. Lord, and glorify thy name? Because all the nations
  shall come and worship thy name; because thine ordinances (lit. truths) were
  manifested.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And after these (things)
  I saw. Lo, the temple of the tabernacle of the witness up in (the) heaven was
  opened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the seven angels came out
  of the temple, they who had the seven plagues, being clothed with garments of
  linen, glorious, bound upon their loins with girdles of gold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And one from the four living-beings gave to the
  seven angels the seven vials of gold, full of the wrath of God who liveth
  unto age of the ages. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the
  temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God, and with his power; and
  no one was able to come into the temple, until these plagues of the seven
  angels were completed.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I heard a great voice from
  (the) heaven, saying to the angels: Go, pour your vials of (the) wrath of God
  below.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the first angel went, he
  poured his vial on the earth; and an evil sore came in the men, they who were
  sealed for the wild beast, and they who worshipped his image. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the second angel poured his vial on the sea;
  and it became blood as that of a dead man; and every soul which liveth died
  in the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the third angel poured
  his vial on the rivers and the fountains of water; and they became blood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I heard the angel of the waters,
  saying: Thou (art) righteous, he who is, and he who was being, because thou
  judgedst these. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Because they shed the
  blood of the martyrs and the prophets, thou gavest blood to them to drink;
  because they are worthy.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I heard
  the altar, saying: Yea, Lord God, the Almighty, the righteous, all thy
  judgements are true.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the fourth
  angel poured his vial on (the) sun; and it was given to him to make heat on
  [the] men with a great heat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the
  men were scorched; and they blasphemed (the) name of God who hath authority
  over these plagues; and they repented not to glorify God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the fifth angel poured his vial on the throne
  of the wild beast; and his kingdom became dark; and they were gnawing their
  tongues from the pain; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and they
  blasphemed God of (the) heaven from the pain, and from their works; and they
  repented not from their evil works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And the sixth angel poured his vial on the river, the great, the Euphratēs.
  And the water was dried up, that the way of the kings who are at the risings
  of (the) sun might be prepared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I
  saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the wild beast, and
  from the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits as frogs;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> for they are spirits of demons, doing
  signs [from] among the kings of (the) earth, to assemble them for (the) war
  of the great day of God, the Almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Lo, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who will
  watch and keep his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they see his
  shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he gathered them to a
  place called in Hebrew `Ermakedōn: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And the seventh angel poured his vial on the air; and he cried a great sound
  out of the temple from the throne, saying: It was done.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And there happened thunders, and voices, and
  lightnings; and a great earthquake happened: there was not any like it since
  man was upon (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the
  great city became into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And
  Babylon, the great, was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of wine
  of (the) wrath of the anger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And all
  islands fled; and the mountains found not their place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And (hail) stones as of talents in weight came
  from (the) heaven upon the men; and the men blasphemed God from the plague of
  the hail (lit. stone) which was very great:</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And one from the seven angels, they
  who have the seven vials, came; and he spake to me, saying: 'Come, that I may
  show to thee (the) judgement of the great harlot who sitteth upon many
  waters; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> she with whom the kings of
  (the) earth sinned; and they committed fornication; they who dwell upon (the)
  earth were drunken with (the) wine of her fornication.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he took me away to (the) desert in the (lit.
  a) spirit: and I saw a woman sitting upon a wild beast, scarlet, full of
  names of blasphemy, there being seven heads upon him, and ten horns.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the woman was being arrayed in a
  garment of purple and [a] scarlet, and gilded with (the) gold and the
  precious stone and pearls: There being a cup of gold in her hand, full of
  defilement of the defilements of her fornication with (the) whole earth :
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> There being a name written on her
  forehead, The mystery of (the) Babylon, (the) mother of the fornicators and
  the abominable of (the) earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I
  saw a woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with (the) blood of the
  martyrs of Jesus; and I wondered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  the angel said to me: 'Why wonderedst thou? I (pron.) shall (lit. will) show
  to thee the mystery of the woman, and the wild beast which beareth her, that
  upon which are the seven heads and the ten horns. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The wild beast which thou sawest, being, and it is
  not, coming up from the abyss, and going to (the) destruction. And all who
  dwell upon (the) earth shall wonder, they whose name is not written on (the)
  book of (the) life. Since (the) beginning of creation of the world, they are
  looking at the wild beast, because it is, and it is not, and it fell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He who hath mind and [a] wisdom let
  him understand: the seven heads being mountains, upon which the woman is
  sitting; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> these are seven kings: the
  five fell, and the other is not, and the other one was not yet; and if he
  should come, he will stay a little (time). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the wild beast which was being, and it is
  not, is himself an eighth from the seven; and he will go to (the)
  destruction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the ten horns which
  thou sawest are ten kings, these who received not yet an authority as kings
  for an hour, having followed the wild beast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> These have one mind and an authority; they will
  give their power to the wild beast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  These shall war with the lamb, he overcoming them, because he is Lord of the
  lords. and (the) King of the kings; and they who are called with him, and the
  chosen, and the faithful.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he
  said to me: The waters which thou sawest, upon which the woman is sitting,
  are peoples and many nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the
  ten horns which thou sawest, and the wild beast, these shall hate the harlot,
  they will desolate her, they will make her naked, and her flesh (plural) they
  shall eat, they shall burn her in the fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For God gave it into their heart to do his mind,
  and for them to be in one mind, to give a kingdom to the wild beast, until
  are completed the words of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which hath kingdom over all the
  kingdoms of (the) earth.'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse18">18</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these things I saw another
  angel, who came from (the) heaven, having a great authority; and (the) earth
  was enlightened from his face and his glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he cried out in a great sound: Babylon the
  great city fell; and became resting place of the demons, and abode of every
  unclean spirit, and abode of every bird unclean (and) hateful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Because from (the) wrath of the wine of her
  fornication all the nations fell; and all the kings of (the) earth, they who
  committed fornication with her; and the merchants of (the) earth became rich
  from her luxury.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I heard a voice
  from (the) heaven, saying: Come out of her, those of my people, that ye may
  not receive of her plagues. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because
  her sins joined themselves to her even unto (the) heaven: and God remembered
  her wrongdoings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Give to her as she
  recompensed; and double them to her according to her works: in her cup as she
  mixed it, double it to her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The glory
  in which she was, and the luxury--give it to her of grief and mourning;
  because she saith in her heart, that I shall (lit. will) sit being a queen;
  and I am not a widow; and I shall not see mourning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore in one day her plagues shall come, [a]
  death and [a] mourning and [a] famine. And she shall be burnt in the fire;
  because strong is the Lord God, he who judged her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And all the kings of (the) earth, they who all
  committed fornication with her, and they were luxurious, shall weep, they
  shall wail over her. But if they should see the smoke of her burning,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> they shall stand afar off, because of
  (the) fear of her torment, saying: "Woe to her, woe to her, the great city
  Babylon, the city which was luxurious, in one hour came her fall."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the merchants of (the) earth
  shall weep, they shall mourn over her, because no one will buy of them their
  freights, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> their freight of gold and
  their freight of silver, and the precious stones, and the pearls and the fine
  linen, and purple and olosirikon and scarlet, and every vessel of ivory, And
  every vessel from the precious woods, and every thyine wood, And brass, and
  iron, and marble; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and cinnamon, and
  incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and symedalion of
  wheat, and beast and sheep and horse, and body and soul of man, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and harvest of the desire of the soul--they went
  from thee, and all thy fatness and thy splendour perished from thee, and thy
  merchants shall not find them any more; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because these are they who became rich from thee:
  standing afar off because of (the) fear of her torment, They shall weep, they
  shall mourn, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> saying: "Woe to thee,
  woe to thee, the great city, which is arrayed in the fine linen and the
  purple and the scarlet, sewn with gold and the costly stone and the pearl.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because in an hour this great
  richness was desolated." And every pilot of the sea, and every one who
  saileth in the sea, are standing afar off, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning,
  saying: Who is like to this great city?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they placed earth on their head, crying out,
  weeping and mourning, saying: "Woe to her, the great city, from whom were
  made rich they whose ships are in the sea, having been made rich from her
  preciousness, because in an hour she was desolated." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Delight thee, (the) heaven over her, and all the
  saints, and the apostles and the prophets; Because the Lord God judged your
  judgement on her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And a strong angel
  cried out a sound, and he took away a great mill stone, he tossed it into the
  sea, saying: "Thus in a fall will fall Babylon. And she will be thrown down
  to the great lake; and the great city shall not be found any more;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> nor (the) sound of a harp. And a
  singer and a trumpet shall not be heard, being in thee any more. And no shall
  be found in thee any more; nor (the) sound of mill shall be heard in thee any
  more; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> nor a light of lamp shall shine
  in thee any more; Nor (the) voice of a bridegroom and a bride shall thy
  merchants and the kings of (the) earth and the great men hear in thee any
  more. Because in thy potions all the nations were led astray. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And (the) blood of the prophets and the saints
  was found in her, and all who were slaughtered upon (the) earth."'</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these (things) I heard as a
  great sound of a vast multitude in (the) heaven, saying: Allēlouia; [the]
  salvation and [the] glory and [the] honour and [the] power are of our God,
  because his judgements are true: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  in a righteous judgement he judged the great harlot; and he took (the)
  vengeance of (the) blood of his servants from her.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And (the) second (time) they said: `Allelouia.'
  And her smoke shall go up unto age of the age. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the twenty-four presbyters threw themselves
  down, and the four living-beings, and they worshipped God, he who sitteth
  upon the throne, saying: 'Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And a
  voice came from the throne, saying: Bless our God, all his servants, and they
  who fear him, the small and the great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And I heard as a great voice of a great multitude, and as (the) voice of many
  waters, and (the) voice of strong thunders, saying : The Lord God, the
  Almighty reigned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Let us rejoice and
  be glad, and glorify him; because the marriage-feast of the lamb came, and
  his bride was prepared for him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it
  was given to her, that she should clothe herself with a fine-linen, glorious,
  pure: for the fine-linen is the righteousness (plur.) of the saints.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to me: Write, "Blessed are
  they who are called to the supper of the lamb."' And he said to me These
  words are true (words) of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I
  fell before his feet, I worshipped him; and he said to me: 'Not so, because I
  (am) a fellow-servant of thine and thy brethren, they who have the witness of
  Jesus. Worship God; for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the truth.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> After these (things) I saw (the)
  heaven opened; and I saw a white horse. And he who sitteth upon him, being
  called, The faithful and the true'; and he gave the judgement in [a]
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And his eyes were
  being like to a flame of fire; having (lit. being) many crowns upon his head;
  having a name written, it is not possible that any one should know it except
  him only. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Having (lit. being) a
  garment on him sprinkled with (the) blood: and being called, (The) word of
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the army was (lit. were)
  walking after him with white horses, being clothed in fine linen (plur.),
  glorious. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And a sharp sword cometh
  from their mouths, that he may smite the nations with it. And he (pron.)
  shall rule them with a staff of iron: and he (pron.) shall tread the
  winepress of the wine of (the) anger of God, the Almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And a name is (lit. being) written on his garment
  and his thigh, (The) King of the kings, and the Lord of the lords.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I saw another angel standing in
  (the) sun; crying out in a great sound, saying: All [the] birds which fly in
  (the) midst of (the) heaven, come, assemble in the great supper of the Lord
  God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> That ye may eat the flesh
  (plug.) of the kings, and the flesh of the khiliarchs, and the flesh of the
  strong, and the flesh of the horses, and those who sit upon them, and the
  flesh of the freemen, and the servants, and the small, and the great.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I saw the wild beast and the
  kings of (the) earth, and their armies, assembled to make a war with him who
  sitteth on the white horse and his army. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the wild beast was seized, and those who were
  with him, and the false prophet, who did the signs among them before him.
  Having bound them who received the seal of the wild beast and them who
  worship his image, they cast them down, both alive, to the lake which burneth
  with fire and sulphur. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And (the)
  remainder were killed with (the) sword of him who sitteth on the horse, which
  came out of his mouth; and all the birds of (the) heaven ate of their
  flesh.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I saw an angel, having come
  down out of (the) heaven, having (the) key of (the) abyss and a great chain
  in his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he laid hold on the
  dragon, the serpent, the ancient, who is the devil, Satan, and he bound him a
  thousand years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He cast him into (the)
  abyss, he shut its mouth, and sealed above him. That he might not lead astray
  the nations, until the thousand years were completed. And after these
  (things) he must be loosed yet a little time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I saw thrones; having sat upon them, judgement
  was given to them concerning the souls of them who were killed because of the
  witness of Jesus, and the word of God, and they who worshipped not the wild
  Least nor his image. And they who received not his seal on their forehead and
  their hand lived with him, and they reigned with Christ a thousand years.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And (the) remainder of the (lead lived
  not until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Blessed is he and a saint of God who
  hath a part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death shall- not
  have (lit. find) authority. But they shall be priests of God and Christ, and
  they shall reign with him the thousand years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if the thousand years should be completed,
  Satan shall be loosed out of the prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he shall lead astray the servants and the
  nations in the four corners of (the) earth. Gōg and Magōg shall be gathered
  to the war; these whose number is as the sand of the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they came up over the breadth of (the) earth;
  and they encircled the camp of the saints and the new city. And a fire came
  out of (the) heaven from God, it consumed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the devil who leadeth them astray was cast
  down to the lake of fire which burneth with sulphur, the place in which are
  the wild beast and the false prophet; and they were tormented in the days and
  the nights unto age of the age. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I saw
  a great white throne, and him who sat upon it, from before whose face (the)
  earth fled away, and (the) heaven; and place of theirs was not found.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And I saw all the dead, the small and

  book was opened, which is that of (the) life. And the dead were judged out of
  the things which were written on the book, according to their works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the sea gave the dead who were in

  holy, new Jerusalem, coming down out of (the) heaven from God, prepared as a
  bride adorned for her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I
  heard a. great voice out of (the) heaven, saying: Lo, the tabernacle of God
  is being with [the] men, and he shall dwell with them, and they also shall be
  to him for a people. And God himself shall be with them: 4 <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he shall wipe every tear from their eyes; and
  death shall not be any more, nor mourning, nor cry. Toil shall not be any
  more, since the first things passed away; lo, all things will become new.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he who sitteth on the throne said
  to me: Lo, I shall (lit. will) make all things new.' And he said to me: Write
  these words, they are faithful and they are true.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to me: I am the alpha and the ō, the
  beginning and the end: I am he who will give to him who is thirsty of the
  fountain of water of life freely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He
  who will overcome shall inherit these things; and I shall be to him as God,
  and he (pron.) shall be to me as son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  But they who will be doubtful, and the unbelieving, and the abominable, and
  the murderers, and the fornicators, and the worshippers of demons, and the
  liars-- Their part shall be in the lake of the fire and the sulphur, which is
  the second death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And one from the
  seven angels came, they who had the seven vials, filled with the seven last
  plagues; be spake to me, saying: Come that I may show to thee the bride,
  (the) wife of the lamb.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he took
  me away in the spirit up on a great mountain, being high: he showed to me the
  city which is holy, Jerusalem, coming down out of (the) heaven from God,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> she which is holy, which is filled
  with glory. But her light is being of a precious stone, as a light of
  precious iaspis, being of christalos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Having a great wall, being high; and the twelve gates. And the twelve angels
  at the gates; and names written, being (the) name of the twelve tribes of
  (the) sons of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> On the east
  three gates, on the south of her three gates, And (the) west of the city
  three gates, and on the north three gates. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the wall of the city having twelve
  foundations, and written upon them (the) name of the twelve apostles of the
  lamb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he who spake to me hath a
  reed of gold, that he might measure the city and her gates and her walls.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the city was a square, and as is
  her length thus also is her breadth. And he measured the city, he found her
  being twelve thousand stadia of length; and her breadth and her height are
  being equal. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And her wall was
  measured, it was found making a hundred forty-four thousand measures of a
  man, that is to say, of an angel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  (the) circuit of the wall-- The foundation was being as an iaspis. And the
  city was being worked with pure gold as [a] pure glass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the foundations of the wall of the city (are)
  built from every precious stone. The first foundation was an iaspis. The
  second is a sapphiros. The third is a karchēdōn. The fourth a smarakdos.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The fifth a sardonix. The sixth a
  sardinon. The seventh a chrisolinthos. The eighth a byrillos. The ninth a
  dopation. The tenth an hyakynthinon. The eleventh a kysoparasos. The twelfth
  an amethitos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the twelve gates of
  pearl, each one. And the street of the city is [a] pure gold, as [a] glass
  making light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I saw not temple in
  her. For the Lord God the Almighty is her temple, and the lamb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the city was not having need of (the) sun,
  nor the moon, that they might make light in her. For (the) glory of God
  enlightened her, and her lamp is the lamb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the nations shall walk by (lit. from) her
  light; and the kings of (the) earth shall bring (the) glory of the nations
  and the honour into her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And her
  gates shall not be shut in the day: and night shall not be there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The nations shall come with their
  glory and their honour into her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  Anything defiled shall not enter her, and they who make defilements:
  falsehood shall not come into her: but only they who are written on the book
  of (the) life of the lamb.</p>

  <h3 id="apocalypse22">22</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I was shown a river of water of
  life, glorious as a christallon, coming from the throne of God and the lamb.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In (the) midst of her street, and the
  river on this side and on that, A tree of (the) life, bringing the twelve
  fruits forth, one for a month. And the leaves of the tree (are) for an
  healing (the) eyes of the nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  no defilement shall be any more, And the throne of God and the lamb shall be
  in her; and (the) anger shall not be. But the servants of God shall serve
  him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and they shall see his face: and
  his name (is) on their forehead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Night
  shall not be any more, nor shall they have need of a light in her, nor a
  light of (the) sun; because the Lord God shall enlighten them, and they shall
  reign unto age of the age. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said
  to me: 'These words are faithful, and they are holy, they are true. And the
  Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his
  servants the things which must happen quickly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Lo, I come, lo, I come quickly. Blessed is he who
  will keep the words of this prophecy of this book.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I am Thannes, he who saw and he who heareth these
  (things). Then having heard and having seen these (things) I threw myself
  down before (the) feet of the angel, who showed to me these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to me: Not so! I (am) a
  fellow-servant of thine, and thy brethren the prophets, and those who will
  keep the words of this book. Worship God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he said to me: Seal not the words of this
  prophecy of this book; for the time approached. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He who doeth wrong, let him do wrong stil: he who
  is polluted, let him be polluted: The just, let him justify himself: he who
  is holy, let him sanctify himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Lo, I come quickly. My reward with me. I shall (lit. will) give to each one
  according to his works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I am the
  alpha and the ō, the beginning and the end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Blessed are all who will do his commandments,
  that their authority may be over the tree of (the) life. And they shall go
  into the city by the gate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the
  dogs (are) outside, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the
  murderers, and the worshippers of demons, and all who do [the] falsehood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I am Jesus: I sent my angel to
  witness to you these words in all the churches. I am the root and the race of
  David; and the star which riseth in the morning, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and spirit and the bride. And they say: "Come."
  And he who heareth, let hima say "Come." And he who thirsteth, let him come.
  He who wisheth, let him take [a] water of life freely. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I (pron.) witness to all who hear the words of
  this prophecy of this book, That he who will add to them, God will add to him
  the plagues which are written on this hook. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But he who will cut off from the words of this
  book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from (the) book of (the)
  life and the holy city which are writtenon this book.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He who witnesseth these (things) saith: They will
  happen and they come quickly.' Come our Lord Jesus Christ <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> upon all the saints unto ago of the ages.</p>
