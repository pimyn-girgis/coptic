  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul and Timotheos, the servants of
  Christ Jesus, to all the saints who are in Christ Jesus who are in
  Philippois, with the bishops and the deacons: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> (the) grace to you and (the) peace from God our
  Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I
  give thanks to my God for all your remembrance <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> which I make always in all my prayers for you all
  in [a] joy making the prayer <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> for your
  fellowship which was with the Gospel from the first day up to now;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> being persuaded about this, that he
  who began in you will complete a good work unto the day of Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> According as it is a righteous work
  for me to think this about you all, because that ye are in my heart; and in
  my bonds, and in my defence and (the) confirMatthewion of the Gospel ye all
  are sharing the grace with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For God
  is my witness, how I love you all in the tender mercies of Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And this is that concerning which I
  pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in (the) knowledge and all
  discernment; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> to cause you to prove
  the things which are profitable; that ye might be sincere and offenceless
  unto (the) day of Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and being
  full of fruit of [the] righteousness which is (lit. the) through Jesus
  Christ, unto [a] glory and [an] honour of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But I wish to cause you to know, my brethren,
  that the things which happened to me came more unto an advance of the Gospel;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> so that my bonds became manifested in
  all the Pretorion and all the rest; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  and most (lit. (the) more) of the brethren who are in the Lord trust to my
  bonds, and dare much more to speak the word of God fearlessly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And some indeed because of [an] envy and [a]
  strife; but some also because of [a] good-will proclaim Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> these indeed in [a] love, knowing that I am set
  for a defence of the Gospel: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> but the
  others (lit. these) in [a] strife proclaim Christ not sincerely, thinking to
  raise [a] tribulation for my bonds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  What then? Nevertheless in every form, whether in [a] pretence or in [a]
  truth, Christ is proclaimed; in this I rejoice, but also I shall rejoice
  still. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For I know that this will
  happen to me unto [a] salvation, through your prayer and (the) supply of the
  spirit of Jesus Christ, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> according to
  my looking and my hope, that I shall (lit. will) not be ashamed in anything,
  but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my
  body, whether through (the) life or through (the) death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For to me (lit. I) Christ is my life, and (the)
  death is [a] gain to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> If the life
  in (the) flesh, this is a fruit of work to me: and what I shall (lit. will)
  choose I know not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The two (things)
  lay hold on me, having (the) desire to be dissolved, that I may be with
  Christ; for much (lit. more) rather is that (lit. it is) chosen: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but the abiding in (the) flesh is more necessary
  because of you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And (of) this being
  persuaded, I know that I shall (lit. will) stay, and I shall (lit. will)
  abide with (lit. to) you all, unto your advance and (the) joy of the faith;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> that your boast may abound in Christ
  Jesus in me through my coming to you again. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Only behave as citizens worthily of the Gospel of
  Christ: that, should I come and see you, or being not with you, I may hear
  concerning you, that ye stand in one spirit, one soul, sharing toil in the
  faith of the Gospel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and not
  frightened in anything by them who are against you; these whose manifestation
  is [a] destruction to them, but to you is [a] salvation, and this is from
  God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> because it was granted to you
  for Christ not only to believe him, but to suffer also for him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Having the same conflict as ye saw in me, and now
  also ye hear in me.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_philippians2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> (As to) being of good courage in
  (lit. conquest of heart of) Christ, (as to) that which is [a] confidence of
  [a] love, that which is a fellowship of [a] spirit, that which is [an]
  affection and [a] compassion, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> fill up
  my joy, that ye may have one thought, it being the same love which ye have,
  sharing in soul, being of one heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Not doing anything in [a] strife, nor in [a] love of vain glory, but in the
  humbleness of heart esteeming one another as surpassing yourselves;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> each one of you not observing your own
  things only, but also the things of one another. Let each one of you
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> think this in yourselves, which is
  that which is in Christ Jesus, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> who,
  existing in [a] form of God, not a robbing thought it to be [an] equal with
  God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but he emptied himself; he took
  [a] form of servant, having been made in [a] likeness of man; having been
  found in [a] fashion as a man, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> he
  humiliated himself, having become obedient up to (the) death, but a death of
  a cross.. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore God abundantly
  exalted him, and granted to him the name which is exalted above every name;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> that in (the) name of Jesus every
  knee should bend--the things of (the) heaven and the things of (the) earth
  and the things of those which are below (the) earth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and that every tongue should confess that the
  Lord (is) Jesus Christ, -unto [a] glory of God the Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Wherefore, my beloved, according as ye were
  obedient always, not in my coming to you only, but now much rather, being not
  with you, in [a] fear and [a] trembling work your salvation; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> for God is he who worketh in you unto wishing and
  the working, for the good pleasure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Work all things without murmuring and reasoning; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> that ye may be blameless and harmless children of
  God, Holy in (the) midst of a generation bent and perverse, among whom ye are
  manifested as luminaries in the world, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> laying hold on the word of (the) life, unto a
  boast for me at (the) day of Christ; that I was not running emptily, nor
  toiled I unto that which is empty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  But if I shall (lit. will) even be poured out as a libation upon the
  sacrifice and the ministering of your faith, I rejoice and I share in
  rejoicing with you all: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> but in this
  rejoice ye also and share in rejoicing with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send to you
  Timotheos quickly, that I also may be at rest in my heart should I know
  concerning your state. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For there is
  not any (other) of mine agreeable to my soul who will take care for you (lit.
  take your care) sincerely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For they
  all seek for their own things, and not the things of Christ Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But ye know his proof that as a child
  to a father he was servant with me unto the Gospel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Him (lit. this) indeed then I hope to send, if I
  should know immediately concerning my affairs: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but I am persuaded in the Lord that I (pron.)
  shall (lit, will) come to you quickly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But I thought it necessary to send to you
  Epaphroditos, the brother and the fellow-worker and my fellow-soldier, but
  being apostle to you and minister of my need; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> since he was loving to see you all, and he was
  grieving, because that ye heard that he was sick: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> for indeed he was sick until he was near unto
  (the) death. And God had mercy on him; but not only on him, but on me also,
  that I might not take grief upon grief again. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> More hastily, then, I sent him, that, should ye
  see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I also may be without grief.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Receive him, then, in the Lord in all
  joy; and let such be honoured by you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  because concerning the work of the Lord he was near up to (the) death, having
  risked his life, that he might fill up your deficiency of the service, which
  befell me.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_philippians3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in
  the Lord. To write these things again to you, is not 'indeed irksome for me,
  to you it is confirming. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Beware of the
  dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the a concision: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> for we are the circumcision, namely they who
  minister the spirit of God, and boasting ourselves in Christ Jesus; and we
  were not trusting in (the) flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Although I (pron.) have a confidence in (the) flesh also: if another thinketh
  to trust in (the) flesh, I the more am (trusting): <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> [a] circumcision on (the) eighth day, from (the)
  race of Israel, (the) tribe of Benjamin, a: Hebrew from Hebrews; according to
  the law I (am) a Pharisee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> according
  to [a] zeal I persecuted the church, according to the righteousness which is
  in the law I was blameless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But the
  things which were being to me gains, these I reckoned to me a loss because of
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But moreover I reckon them all
  losses because of the excellence of (the) knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
  This (one) for whom I lost all things, and I reckon them all rubbish, that I
  might gain Christ, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and be found in
  him, not having my righteousness, that (lit. the) from the law, but that from
  (the) faith of Christ, But the righteousness [the] from God upon (the) faith:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> to cause me to know him, and the
  power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his pains, changing myself
  into form with his death; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> that
  perhaps I may attain unto (the) resurrection of the dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Not that I have obtained, or I was already
  completed: but I run, that perhaps I may apprehend in that (lit. this) in
  which I was apprehended by Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My brethren, I (pron.) think not of myself that I
  have apprehended: but one (thing),--I am forgetting indeed the things behind,
  but I am stretching myself unto the things before <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> with an expectation I am running for the palm of
  the high calling of God which is in Christ Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Let every one who is completed think this of
  himself: and if ye think another thing in another way, this also will God
  reveal to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> nevertheless that unto
  which we reached, with this let us be consistent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Be ye sharers of likeness to me, my brethren, and
  look at them who walk thus, according as we are an example to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For there are many (who) walked,
  these concerning whom I said to you many times, and now again weeping I
  say--the enemies of the cross of Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> these whose end is (the) destruction, these whose
  god is their belly; and their glory was in a shame: these who think the
  things of (the) earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For our
  (pron.) citizenship was in the heavens; and from there we look forward to our
  saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> who
  will change (the) body of our humiliation in conformity with (the) body of
  his glory, according to the working to have power and to make all things
  subject to him.</p>

  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_philippians4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Wherefore, my brethren dear and
  beloved, my joy and my crown, thus stand in the Lord, my beloved.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Euodia I beseech and Syntychē to think
  the same thing in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Yea, I
  beseech thee also, [the] chosen yokefellow, help them, these who toiled with
  me in the Gospel, with Klementos also, and (the) rest of my fellow-workers,
  these whose name is written on (the) book of (the) life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Rejoice in the Lord always: again I say,
  'Rejoice.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Let your moderation be
  manifest to every man. The Lord is near. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Take not care; but in everything the supplication
  and the prayer in [a] thanksgiving,--let your requests be manifested unto
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the peace of God, which is
  higher than all intelligence, shall keep your hearts and your thoughts in
  Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Finally, my brethren,
  the things which are true, the things which are reverend, the things which
  are just, the things which are pure; all things in [a] love, all things of
  good tidings; that which is [a] virtue, and that which is [an] honour, think
  on these, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> which are those (lit. these)
  which ye learned and ye received and ye heard and ye saw in me--these things
  do: and God of [the] peace shall be with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But I rejoiced greatly in the Lord' that now ye
  put forth at length a thought concerning me; in that which ye thought, but
  the time was not being favourable to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Not that I said (it) with reference to a being in
  want: for I (pron.) knew, in the things in which I am, to be content.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I know how to be humiliated, I know
  how to abound in everything; I am taught also in them all both to be
  satisfied and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I have power in everything by (lit. in) him who
  encourageth me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Nevertheless ye did
  well, having shared in my tribulation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But ye know also [the] Philippians, that in (the)
  beginning of the Gospel, I having come from (the) Makedonia, none among the
  churches shared with me in a receiving and a giving except you only;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because in Thessalonikē also once and
  twice ye sent to me for my need. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Not
  that I sought for the gift; but I sought for the fruit which aboundeth unto
  your work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But I received all things,
  and I abounded: I was filled, having received from Epaphroditos the things
  which are yours, as an odour of fragrance, as a sacrifice acceptable,
  pleasing to God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But my God shall
  fill up to you every need according to his riches in [a] glory in Christ
  Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But God and our Father, his be
  the glory unto age of the ages. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  All the brethren who are with me salute you. All the saints salute you,
  especially they (lit. the) from (the) house of (the) king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> (The) grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your
  spirit, my brethren. Amēn.</p>
