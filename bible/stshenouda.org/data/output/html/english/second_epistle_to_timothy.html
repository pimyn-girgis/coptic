  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul, (the) apostle of Christ Jesus
  through (the) wish of God according to the promise of (the) life which is in
  Christ Jesus, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to Timotheos my beloved
  child, (the) grace, (the) mercy, (the) peace from God the Father and Christ
  Jesus our Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I give thanks to God
  whom I serve from my ancestors, in pure conscience, as remembering thee
  unfailingly in my prayers by night and day, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> loving to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I
  may be filled with joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Remembering
  the faith which is in thee unfeigned; this which dwelt first in (the) mother
  of thy mother Lōēdē, and thy mother Eunikē; but I am persuaded that it dwelt
  in thee also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Therefore I remind thee
  that thou should revivify the grace of God, which is this which is in thee,
  this which was given to thee through my laying on of hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For God giveth not to us a spirit of fear, but of
  [a] power and [a] love and [a] prudence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Be not ashamed then of the witness of our Lord,
  nor of me also the prisoner of his: but suffer with the Gospel according to
  the power of God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> he who saved us, and
  he called us in a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to
  his foreordaining alone, and his grace which he gave to us in Christ Jesus
  before the eternal times, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but it was
  manifested now by the manifestation of our saviour Jesus Christ. He having
  done away indeed with (the) death; but he caused (the) life and [the]
  incorruption to enlighten through the Gospel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> this of which I (pron.) was appointed for
  proclaimer and apostle and teacher of the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Therefore I suffer these (pains), but I am not
  ashamed of it, for I know him whom I believed, and I am persuaded that it is
  possible for him to keep my deposit unto that day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Put by thee a form of sound words, these which
  thou heardest from me, in [a] faith and [a] love, which is in Christ Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The good deposit keep through the
  holy spirit, which dwelleth in us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Thou knowest this, that they who are in Asia all turned away from me, of whom
  are Phygelos and Ermogenēs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But the
  Lord shall give [a] mercy to (the) house of Onesyphoros because he gave rest
  to me many times, and my chain he was not ashamed of; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> but having come to Rōmē, he hastened to seek for
  me, and he found me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But the Lord
  shall give to him, to find [a] mercy with the Lord in that day; all the
  ministries which he did to me in Ephesos thou (pron.) knowest the more.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_timothy2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thou then, my child, be encouraged
  in the grace which is in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  The things which thou heardest from me through many witnesses, these commits
  to faithful men, those (lit. these) who will be worthy to teach others.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Share in suffering as a good soldier
  of Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> No one being soldier
  entangleth himself in the works of this life; that he may please him who
  armed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if (any) one should go
  to (the) place of contending, he is not crowned unless he contendeth
  lawfully. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The husbandman who toileth
  must take first from the fruits. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Understand the things which I say; for the Lord shall give to thee a
  knowledge in all things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Remember
  Jesus Christ who rose from them who are dead, from (the) seed of David
  according to my Gospel: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that in which
  I suffer even unto bonds as an evil doer; but (the) word of God is not bound.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore I am patient in all things
  because of the elect, that they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ
  Jesus, with the eternal glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Faithful is (the) word; for if we died with him, then we shall (lit. will)
  live with him also: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> if we shall (lit.
  will) be patient, then we shall (lit. will) reign with him also: if we shall
  (lit. will) deny him, he also will deny us: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> if we shall (lit. will) be unbelieving, that one
  will stay being faithful; for it is not possible that he should deny himself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Remind them of these things,
  witnessing before God, not to dispute in (the) word for anything in which
  there is not gain, unto a ruining of them who hear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Haste thee to present thyself as one chosen for
  God, as a workman (who) is not ashamed, dividing (the) word of the truth
  rightly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But avoid profane and empty
  stories: for they advance further in ungodliness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and their word findeth pasture as a canker which
  eateth: from whom is Hymeneos and Phyletos: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> these who agree not with (the) truth, saying that
  (the) resurrection has already happened, and they turn (the) faith of others
  away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The firm foundation however of
  God standeth, having this seal: The Lord knew them who are his: let all who
  say (the) name of the Lord abstain from (the) wrongdoing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But in a great house not only vessels of gold and
  silver (vessels are those) which are in it; but there are (vessels of) wood
  also and earthenware; some indeed being unto (the) honour, but others being
  unto [a] dishonour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> If then (any) one
  should cleanse himself from all these, he shall be a vessel unto (the) honour
  cleansed, serviceable for his master, prepared unto all good works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The youthful lusts avoid, but run
  after [the] righteousness, [the] faith, [the] love, [the] peace with all who
  cry unto (the) name of the Lord out of a cleansed heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But the questions of foolishness and ignorance
  avoid. Thou shalt know this, that they gender contentions: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but a servant of the Lord ought not to dispute,
  but to be meek with all, apt to teach, forbearing the evil, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> teaching in [a] meekness them who oppose him,
  that perhaps God might give to them [a] repentance some time to cause them to
  know the truth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and be sober from the
  snare with which the devil caught them, being subjected by him to the will of
  that (one).</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_timothy3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But this know, that in the last
  days evil times shall be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For [the]
  men shall be loving themselves alone, lovers of silver, boastful, proud,
  blasphemers, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> uncompassionate, inconstant, slanderers, not able
  to control themselves, receiving not teaching, loving not the good,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> being traitors, headstrong, haughty,
  being lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> having (the) form of [the] godliness, but denying
  its power: [but] these [others] avoid. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  But among these are they who sink into the houses, taking captive women full
  of sin, leading them in lusts of many kinds, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> learning always, and they are not able ever to
  come into (the) knowledge of the truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But as Jannēs and Jambrēs who opposed Moses, thus
  these others also oppose the truth; men whose heart is corrupt, reprobate
  about the faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But they will not
  advance any further; for their ignorance will be manifest to all, according
  as that of the others became. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But
  thou walkedst after my doctrine, after my form, after my foreordaining, my
  faith, my longsuffering, my love, my patience; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> all the persecutions and these pains which
  happened to me in (the) Antiochia, in Ikonion, in Lystrois; all the
  persecutions which I received; the Lord saved me from them all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But all who wish to live in [a] godliness in
  Christ Jesus will be persecuted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  evil men and impostors shall come forward the more in the evil, deceiving and
  being deceived. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But thou (pron.)
  abide in the things which thou learnedst, and in which thou trustedst,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> knowing through whom thou learnedst;
  and from being a child holy writings (are those) which thou knowest, these
  for which it is possible to give teaching to thee unto [the] salvation
  through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> All scriptures of inspiration of God are
  profitable unto [a] doctrine, unto [a] reproof, unto [a] correction, unto
  [an] instruction which is in [the] righteousness: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that (the) man of God may be prepared and
  established in all good works.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_timothy4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I witness before God and Christ
  Jesus who will judge them who are living and them who are dead, and (by) his
  manifestation and his kingdom; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  proclaim the word, be upon them in season, out of season; reprove, exhort,
  rebuke in all longsuffering and teaching. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For times will happen when they shall not receive
  sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts drawing to themselves
  teachers, tickling their ears; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> their
  hearing indeed they shall turn from (the) truth, but they shall turn aside
  after the fables. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But thou (pron.) be
  sober in all things, suffer, work as a preacher of good tidings, fulfil thy
  ministry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For I (pron.) now shall
  (lit. will) be removed, and (the) time of my dissolution drew near.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The good strife I strove. The course I
  completed. The faith I kept. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Henceforth is laid (up) for me the crown of [the] righteousness, that which
  the Lord will give to me in that day, the righteous judge; but not only to me
  alone, but also all who loved his manifestation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Haste thee to come to me quickly: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> for Dēmas forsook me, having loved this present
  age, he went to Thessalonikia; Kriskēs to [the] Galatia; Titos to
  DalMatthewia; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Loukas alone (it is)
  who is with me. Markos, take him away, bring him with thee, for he is
  serviceable to me unto [a] ministry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  But Tychikos I sent to Ephesos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The
  cloak which I left in Trōas with Karpō, bring it (when thou) art coming, and
  the books also, especially the parchments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Alexandros, the smith, did much evil to me: the
  Lord shall give recompense to him according to his works. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> This (man), from whom keep thou thyself also, for
  he greatly opposed my words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> In my
  first defence he let not any come to me, but they all forsook me. It shall
  not be reckoned to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But the Lord
  stood with me: he gave power to me; that through me the proclaiming might be
  fulfilled, And all the Gentiles might hear that I was saved from the mouth of
  a lion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Lord shall preserve me
  from every evil work, and shall bring me safe into his kingdom of (the)
  heaven: he whose is the glory unto age of the ages. Amen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Salute Priskylla and Akylla, and (the) house of
  Onēsiphoros. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Erastos stayed in
  Korinthos. But Trophēmos I left in Melitos sick. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Haste thee to come before the winter. Euboulos
  saluteth thee, and Pioudēs and Nilos and Klaudios and all the brethren.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The Lord Jesus Christ with thy
  spirit. (The) grace with you.</p>
