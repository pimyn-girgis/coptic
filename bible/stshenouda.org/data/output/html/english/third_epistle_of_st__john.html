  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The presbyter to Gaios the beloved,
  he whom I (pron.) love in [a] truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  My beloved, I pray concerning all things for thy ways to be straight, and
  that thou mayest be in health, according as (the) ways of thy soul are
  straightened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I rejoiced greatly, the
  brethren having come and having witnessed unto thy truth, according as thou
  (pron.) walkest in [a] truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For I
  have not grace greater than this, that I may hear concerning my children,
  that they walk in [a] truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> [The]
  beloved, (it is) a faithful work which thou doest, working among the
  brethren, and this among the strangers; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> these who witnessed unto thy love before their
  churches, these whom thou wilt do well (in) escorting worthily of God :
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for they went forth by (Eyrett) the
  name, taking not anything from the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> We then ought to receive such, that we may be
  fellow-workers with the truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thou
  wrotest a thing to the church: but Diotrephēs, the lover of being first among
  them, receiveth us not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore,
  should I come, I shall (lit. will) cause him to remember his works which he
  doeth, prating against us in evil words: and he is not content with these
  (things), neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them who wish to
  receive them he letteth not, and he is casting them out of the churchchurch.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> My beloved, imitate not the evil, but
  the good. He who doeth the good is from God: but he who doeth the evil saw
  not God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Dimētrios was witnessed unto
  by all, and by (the) truth: and we (pron.) witness, and thou knowest that our
  witness is true. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Having many things
  to write to thee, [but] I wish not to write to thee with [an] ink and a reed:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but I hope immediately to see thee,
  and that we may speak to one another, mouth to mouth. (The) peace to thee.
  The friends salute thee. Salute the friends according to their names.</p>
