  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians1">1</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul (the) apostle, not from man, nor through man,
  but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, he (lit. this) who raised him
  from them who are dead, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and all the
  brethren who are with me, to the churches of (the) Galatia: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> (The) grace to you and (the) peace from God our
  Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he
  (lit. this) who gave himself for our sins, to the end that he might save us
  out of this age which is evil, which exists, according to the will of God and
  the Father: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> whose is the glory unto
  age of the ages. Amēn. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I wonder that
  thus quickly they remove you from him who called you in (the) grace of Christ
  unto another Gospel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> which is not
  another; except perhaps that there are some troubling you, wishing to pervert
  the Gospel of Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But even if we,
  or an angel from (the) heaven, preach good tidings to you outside of that
  which we preached to you, let him be an anathema. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> As we said before, and now again I say, that he
  who will preach good tidings to you outside of that which ye received, let
  him be an anathema. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For now did I
  persuade [the] men or God? Or did I seek for pleasing man? If I was pleasing
  man still, then I (am) no longer a servant of Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But I show to you, my brethren, the Gospel, which
  was preached by me, that it is not one according to man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For neither did I (pron.) receive it from man,
  nor was it taught to me, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For ye heard of my walk (of life)
  once in the Judaism, that abundantly I was persecuting the church of God, and
  I was devastating it: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I was advancing
  in the Judaism more than many of my age in my race, being more (a) zealot in
  the things which my fathers delivered unto me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But when God was well pleased, he who separated
  me from (the) womb of my mother, and he called me by his grace, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach good
  tidings of him among the Gentiles; immediately I applied not to flesh and
  blood, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> nor went I up to Jerusalem
  unto the apostles, who were before me. But I went to (the) Arabia. Again I
  returned to Damascos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Then after
  three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Kēpha, and I stayed with him
  fifteen days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But another of the
  apostles I saw not, except James (the) brother of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But the things which I write to you, behold,
  before God, that I say not falsehood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  But after these things I came to the parts of [the] Syria and [the] Kylikia.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But the churches of [the] Judea,
  which were in Christ, were not knowing me in my face: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but only they were wont to hear, that he who was
  persecuting us once, now preacheth good tidings of the faith which he was
  devastating once; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and they were
  glorifying God in me.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians2">2</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem
  with Barnabas; but I took Titus also with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But I went up according to a revelation, and I
  laid before them the Gospel, which I proclaim among the Gentiles; but apart
  to them who were thought (much of), lest by any means I ran vainly, or was
  running. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But neither Titos even who
  was with me, being a Greek, could be compelled to be circumcised.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But because of the false brethren who
  came in to spy out our freedom, this which we have in Christ, that they might
  make us servants: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> these in whose
  subjection we stayed not for an hour; that the truth of the Gospel might be
  permanent with you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But from them who
  think that they (lit. we) are (something); as to the manner of which they
  once were, it makes not any difference to me: God accepteth not person of
  man. For they, who think that they (lit. we) are something, added not
  anything to me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but on the contrary,
  having see that I was entrusted with the Gospel of the uncircumcision,
  according as Peter was entrusted with that of the circumcision. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For he who worked in Peter unto an apostleship of
  (the) circumcision worked in me also unto the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having known the grace which is given to me,
  James and Kēphas and John, who are thought to be pillars, Gave the right hand
  to me and Barnabas unto [a] fellowship, that we indeed might (be) unto the
  Gentiles, but they unto the circumcision <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> only that we should take care of the poor; and
  this I hastened to do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But Kēphas
  having come into (the) Antiochia, I opposed him, face to face, because he has
  been condemned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For before that any
  came from James he was wont to eat with the Gentiles: but they having come he
  withdrew by himself and he separated himself, fearing them of (the)
  circumcision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the rest of the
  Jews were hypocritical with him; so that Barnabas also went (away) in their
  hypocrisy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But having seen that they
  stood not in the truth of the Gospel, I said to Kēphas before all: ‘If thou
  thyself a Jew livest as a Gentile and not as a Jew how compellest thou the
  Gentiles to Judaise? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But we are by
  nature Jews, and not of the Gentiles, sinners. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> We are knowing that the man will not be justified
  from the works of the law, except from (the) faith of Jesus Christ; and we
  also believed Christ Jesus, that we might be justified from (the) faith
  Christ, not from the works of the law: because from the works of the law will
  no flesh be justified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if,
  seeking for being justified in Christ, we also were found to be (lit. being)
  sinners, then Christ is a minister of (the) sin. It shall not be.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For if the things which I pulled
  down, these again I build, I prove myself (a) transgressor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For I (pron.) through [a] law died to the law,
  that I might live with God. I was crucified with Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> I live, no longer I, but Christ liveth in me: but
  that in which I live now in (the) flesh, I lived in the faith of (the) Son of
  God, he (lit. this) who loved me, and gave himself for me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I shall (lit. will) not reject the grace of God.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians3">3</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O [the] foolish Galatians, who bewitched you,
  before whose eyes Jesus Christ was fore-written, having been crucified?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> This only (is it) which I wish to know
  from you. Received ye the spirit from the works of the law or from (the)
  hearing of (the) faith? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thus ye are
  foolish. Having begun in the spirit, [but] now ye complete in (the) flesh.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye suffer many toils in vain, if
  indeed in vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He then who supplieth
  the spirit to you, and who worketh powers among you, is it something from the
  works of the law, or from (the) hearing of the faith? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> According as Abraham believed God, it was reckoned
  to him for [a] righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Ye know,
  then, that they (who are) from (the) faith, these (are) the sons of Abraam.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the Scripture having foreseen that
  from (the) faith God will justify the Gentiles, preached good tidings before
  to Abraam: All the Gentiles shall be blessed in thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Wherefore they (who are) from (the) faith will be
  blessed with the faithful Abraam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For
  all who are from the works of the law, are under (the) curse: for it is
  written: 'Cursed is every one who will not stay in all the things which are
  written on (the) book of this law unto (the) doing them.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Because in the works of the law no one will be
  justified with God. It is manifested, that the righteous is to live from
  (the) faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the law is not from
  the faith; but he who will do them, shall live in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Christ bought us from (the) curse of the law,
  having become a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one who
  hangeth on (the) tree:' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that (the)
  blessing of Abraam might be among the Gentiles in Christ Jesus; that we might
  receive the promise of the spirit through (the) faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My brethren, I spoke according to man: though (it
  is) a covenant of a man, should it he confirmed, no one rejecteth it, nor add
  they fresh ordinance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But promises
  were promised to Abraam and his seed. He was not saying: And his seeds,' as
  about many; but as about one: 'And thy seed,' which is Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But this I say, that a covenant having been
  confirmed before by God, (the) law which happened after four hundred (and)
  thirty years dissolveth it not, to cause it to do away with the promise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For if the inheritance is from (the)
  law, then it is no more from a promise: but God granted to Abraam through a
  promise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> What then is (the) law? It
  was given because of the transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom
  he promised; having been ordained through angels, in (the) hand of a
  mediator: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but the mediator is not of
  one, but God is one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> (The) law then
  was against the promises of God. It shall not be: for if law had been given,
  it being possible for it to give life, certainly [the] righteousness would
  have been from the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But (the)
  Scripture shut (up) everything in (the) sin, that the promise through (the)
  faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them who believe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Before the faith came we were being kept under
  the law, being shut (up) unto the faith which cometh to be revealed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Wherefore the law guided us to
  Christ, that we might be justified from (the) faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But the faith having come, we are no more under a
  guide. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For ye all are sons of God,
  through (the) faith, in Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  For ye all, namely they who were baptised in Christ, clothe you with Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> There is not Jew nor Greek, there is
  not servant nor free, there is not male nor female: for ye all are one in
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> If ye (are) they of Christ,
  then ye (are) they of (the) seed of Abraam, according to the promise ye (are)
  heirs.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians4">4</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I say that as long as the heir is a little child
  there is not any difference between him and a servant, though he be (lit.
  being) lord of all things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But he was
  under guardians and stewards unto the term of his father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thus we also, when we were children, were being
  under the elements of the world, being servants to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but when (the) fulness of the time came, God sent
  his Son, having become under a woman, having become under the law,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that he might buy them who are under
  the law, that we might receive the sonship. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But because ye (are) sons, God sent the spirit of
  his Son into your hearts, crying out: ‘Abba, (the) Father.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wherefore thou (art) no more a servant, but a son;
  but if a son, then an heir also through God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But at that time indeed not knowing God, ye were
  servants to them by nature who are not gods: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but now ye knew God, but rather God knew you; how
  return ye again into the feeble and poor elements to which ye wish to be
  servants another time? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Having
  observed days and months and times and years; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I am afraid of you, lest by any means I toiled
  for you in vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Become as I (am),
  because I also (am) as ye (are). My brethren, I beseech you, ye did me not
  any wrong: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> but ye know that because
  of a weakness of the flesh I preached good tidings to you at first:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and your temptation which is in my
  flesh ye despised not, nor reviled it; but ye received him as an angel of
  God, as Christ Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Where was then
  your felicitation? For I witness to you, that if it had been possible for you
  to pluck out your eyes, ye would have given them to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Wherefore I became enemy to you; because I show
  to you (the) truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They are zealous
  unto you, not well; but wishing to shut you (out), that ye may be zealous
  unto them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But it is good to be
  zealous in the good always, and not only (when) I am with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> My children, they (lit. these) for whom I travail
  again, until Christ be formed in you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  but I was wishing to come to you now, and to change my voice; because I am
  doubtful about you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Say then to me,
  ye who wish to be under the law--ye know not the law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For it is written that Abraam begat two sons, one
  from the maidservant, and one from the free-(woman). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But he indeed who was (lit. the) from the
  maidservant was born according to flesh; but he who was (lit. the) from the
  free(woman) is one from a promise, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  which things contain an allegory; these are two covenants, one indeed from
  (the) mountain Sina bearing (children) unto [a] servitude, that is to say,
  Agar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Agar is (the) mountain
  Sina, being in (the) Arabia; but it was ranked along with present Jerusalem;
  for she is servant with her children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  But Jerusalem which is above is a freewoman, that is to say, our mother.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For it is written: 'Delight thyself,
  [the] barren woman, she who beareth not. Break forth and cry out, she who
  travaileth not; because many are the children of the desolate (woman), rather
  than (of) her who hath the husband.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  But we, our brethren, according to Isaac, are children of the promise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But as at that time he who was born
  according to flesh was persecuting him who was born according to the spirit,
  thus also now. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But what is it which
  the Scripture saith? Cast out this maidservant and her son: for (the) son of
  the maidservant shall not inherit with (the) son of the free(woman).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But we, our brethren, are not (the)
  children of the maidservant, but the free(woman).
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians5">5</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For in [the] freedom Christ made us free. Stand
  then, and put (lit, give) not yourselves under a yoke of servitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Behold, I Paul, I say to you, that if
  you should receive circumcision, Christ will not profit you anything.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But I witness again to every man who
  receiveth circumcision, that he is debtor to do (the) whole law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye were done away with from Christ; they who
  justify themselves in the law--ye fell from the grace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For we (pron.) in the spirit, from [a] faith look
  out forward for [a] hope of [a] righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For in Christ Jesus neither (the) circumcision
  hath power, nor the uncircumcision, but [a] faith being worked through [the]
  love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But ye were running well; who
  prevented you (so as) not to be persuaded of (the) truth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> This persuasion is not [a] from him who calleth
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> A little leaven causeth the whole
  lump to be leavened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For I am
  persuaded about you in the Lord, that ye will not think another thing: but he
  who troubleth you is bearing the judgement, he who he is. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But I, my brethren, if it is still [a]
  circumcision which I proclaim, then why am I persecuted? So then the
  stumblingblock of the cross of Christ was done away with. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I would that they were mutilated who trouble you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For ye (pron.), my brethren, were
  called unto [a] freedom; only bring not the freedom into a pretext of the
  flesh. But through [the] love be servants to one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the whole law was fulfilled in one word, in
  (the) loving thy neighbour as thyself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But if ye bite one another and devour (lit. eat),
  see lest by any means ye should be consumed by one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But I say: Walk in the spirit, and ye shall not
  fulfil the lust of your flesh.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For
  the flesh lusteth against the spirit; but the spirit against the flesh; for
  these are opposed to one another; that the things which ye wish, these ye may
  not do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But if ye walk in the spirit,
  then ye are under (the) law no more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  But the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; [the] fornication,
  uncleanness, defilement, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> idolatry,
  sorcery, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, revellings, divisions,
  heresies, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> envyings, murders,
  drunkennesses, quarrellings, and the things which are like to these, these of
  which I say to you before, according as also I said before, that they who do
  such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But (the) fruit of the spirit, this is [a]a love,
  joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> meekness, temperance; law is not against such
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But those of Christ Jesus
  crucified their flesh with its passions and its lusts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But if we live in the spirit, then let us also
  agree with the spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Let us not be
  in a love of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
  <h3 id="epistle_to_the_galatians6">6</h3><span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> My brethren, if a man should go in transgression,
  ye, namely the spiritual ones, correct such a one in a spirit of meekness;
  considering thyself also, lest by any means thou should be tempted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Bear the burdens of one another: thus
  ye will fulfil the law of Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But
  if any one thinketh that he (lit. I) is (something), being nothing, he
  deceived himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Let each one prove
  his work, and then his boast shall be to himself, and not to his neighbour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For each one shall carry his own
  burden. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Let him who is instructed
  share with him who instructeth him with the word in every good (thing).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Be not led astray; God will not be
  derided. For that which [the] man will sow, this also he will reap.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Because he who will sow unto his flesh
  will reap also of his flesh [a] destruction; but he who sowed the spirit will
  reap also from the spirit [a] life eternal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But doing the good let us not faint; for in a time
  of our own we shall (lit. will) reap, not losing heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> So then while we have [a] time, let us work the
  good with all, but mostly with them of the household of (the) faith.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> See that I wrote to you in writings
  of size with (lit. in) my hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They
  who wish to make a fair show in (the) flesh, these (are they) who compel you
  to receive circumcision, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross
  of Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For not even themselves
  also, who were circumcised, keep the law; but they wished for you to receive
  circumcision, that they may boast themselves in your flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But it shall not be to me (pron.) that I should
  boast myself, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, he (lit. this)
  through whom the world was crucified to me, and I also was crucified to the
  world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For in Christ Jesus neither
  (the) circumcision is anything, nor [the] uncircumcision, but it is a new
