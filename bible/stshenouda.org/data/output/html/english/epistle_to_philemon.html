  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus,
  and Timotheos the brother, to Phylimōn our beloved, and our fellow-worker,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and Apphia the sister, and Archippos
  our fellow-soldier, and the church of their house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> (The) grace to you and (the) peace from God our
  Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I
  give thanks to my God always, remembering thee in my prayers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I heard concerning thy love and thy faith, this
  which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and (to) all the saints; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> That the fellowship of thy faith may become
  working in (the) knowledge of all good, this which is in you unto Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For I received a great joy and [a]
  comfort in (ea,. exert) thy love. Because the inmost heart of the saints was
  rested through thee, [the] brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Therefore I have a great boldness in the Lord to command thee the things
  which are right: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> because of (the) love
  rather I beseech thee, one such as I, Paul the old man, but now also the
  prisoner of Christ Jesus: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I beseech
  thee concerning my child, he whom I begat in my bonds, Onēsimos, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> he who was being unserviceable to thee once, but
  now he is serviceable to me and thee: he whom I sent to thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> but thou receive him, that is to say, my inmost
  heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He whom I (pron.) was wishing
  to hold with me, that he might minister to me instead of thee in the bonds of
  the Gospel: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but without thy opinion I
  wished not to do anything, that thy goodness might not be according to a
  necessity, but in a readiness of heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For perhaps therefore he was separated from thee
  for an hour, that thou mightest take him for ever; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> not any more as a servant, but (a.) as a brother
  beloved, being better than a servant, especially to me, how much then rather
  to thee, both in (the) flesh and in the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If then I am with thee as a partner receive him
  thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But if he did thee any wrong,
  or whether he is in debt to (thee), reckon this to me; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I Paul, I wrote it with (lit. in) my hand, I will
  pay: that I may not say to thee that thou art debtor thyself to give thee to
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Yea, my own (pron.) brother, I
  shall rest me in thee in the Lord: give rest to my inmost heart in Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Being persuaded about thine obedience
  I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do more than the things which I say.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But withal prepare for me a lodging:
  for I hope that through your prayers I shall (lit. will) be granted to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Apaphras my fellow-captive saluteth
  thee in Christ Jesus; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Markos,
  Aristarchos, Dēmas, Loukas, my fellowworkers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> (The) grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your
  spirit.</p>
