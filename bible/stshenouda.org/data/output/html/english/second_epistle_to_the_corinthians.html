  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul (the) apostle of Christ Jesus,
  through (the) wish of God, and Timotheos the brother, to the church of God,
  which is in Korinthos, with all the saints who are in all [the] Achaia:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> (the) grace to you and (the) peace
  from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> God is faithful, the Father of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, the Father of the compassions, and God of all comfort; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> he (lit. this) who comforted us in all our
  tribulation, to cause us also to be able to comfort all who are in any (lit.
  all) tribulation, through the comfort in which God comforted us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Because according as the pains of Christ abound
  into us, thus also through Christ aboundeth our comfort also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And whether we be afflicted, it is for your
  consolation and salvation, which nis effectual in the enduring of the same
  sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
  consolation and salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and our
  hope (is) firm for you; knowing that according as ye are sharers of the
  pains, thus also of the comfort. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I
  wish you not to be (lit. being) ignorant, my brethren, concerning the
  tribulation which happened to us in [the] Asia, that we were weighed down
  excessively, more than our power, so that we gained not the life even:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but in ourselves we received the
  answer of (the) death, that we might not trust in ourselves only, but in God
  who raiseth the dead: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he (lit. this)
  who saved us from death such as this, and will save us: in whom we hoped that
  still he will save us; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> ye also being
  fellow workers in [the] prayer for us; that through many persons (praying)
  (for) the grace toward us thanks may be given to God through many because of
  us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For this is our boast, the
  witness of your conscience, that in [an] holiness and [a] truth of God, not
  in [a] carnal wisdom, but in [a] grace of God we walked in the world, and
  especially (lit. but more) with you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  For not other things we wrote to you except those which ye read, and of which
  also ye have knowledge; I hope that ye will know unto the end: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> according as ye partly knew us, that we are your
  boast, according as ye also are ours in (the) day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And in this persuasion I wished to
  come to you at first, that ye might receive the second joy; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and through you I might go to (the) Macedonia,
  and again from (the) Macedonia to come to you; and that ye (pron.) might
  escort me to [the] Judea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Wishing,
  then, this, did I at all act in [a] levity? Or the things which I counsel,
  did I counsel them according to flesh, that the yea yea and the nay nay
  should be with me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> God is surety
  (lit. faithful) that our word which was (spoken) to you was not a yea and a
  nay, but a yea (is) that which was in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, he (lit. this)
  whom we proclaimed among you through me and Silouanos and Timotheos, was not
  a yea and a nay, but a yea (is) that which is in him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> for all the promises of God which are in him are
  a yea: therefore also through him is the Amēn of God unto a glory through us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he who confirmeth us with you is
  Christ, and he who saved us is God; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  and he sealed us, and he gave to us the earnest of the spirit into our
  hearts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But I (pron.) call to God as
  witness upon my soul, that sparing you I came not any more to Korinthos.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Not that we have lordship over your
  faith, but we are fellow workers of your joy. For ye stood in (the)
  faith.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> This I judged in myself, not to
  come to you again in [a] grief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For if
  I indeed grieve you, then who maketh me to rejoice except him who is grieved
  by me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And this I wrote, that, should
  I come to you again, I might not receive grief of them by whom I ought to
  rejoice. Being persuaded of (lit. upon) you all, that my joy is that of you
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For out of [a] great tribulation
  and grief I wrote to you through many tears: not that your heart might be
  pained, but that ye might know the love which aboundeth in me unto you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if one gave grief, he gave not
  grief to me but in part; that I may not lay weight upon you all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which
  was done through many; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> so that on the
  contrary rather ye should condone and comfort him, lest by any means in the
  abundance of grief such a one might be swallowed up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Therefore I beseech you to confirm [a] love unto
  (lit. into) him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For therefore I wrote
  to you that I might know your proof; if ye are obedient in all things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But to whom ye will condone, I also
  do (it) to him: for I (pron.) also condone that which I condoned, [I did it]
  because of you, in (the) person of Jesus Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> that Satan may not do us wrong, for we forget not
  his thoughts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But having come to
  Trōas for the Gospel of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the
  Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> my spirit rested not, I having
  not found Titos my brother: and having taken leave of them, I came from there
  to (the) Macedonia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But thanks be to
  God, he (lit. this) who manifesteth us always in Christ, and manifesting
  through us savour of his knowledge in every place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because we are a sweet savour of Christ to God,
  in them who will be saved, and in them who will perish; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> to some indeed a savour from [a] death to [a]
  death; but to some a savour from [a] life to [a] life. And who is sufficient
  for these things? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For we were not
  'being as many, trafficking with (the) word of God: but as from [a]
  sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Begin we again to commend
  ourselves, 'or do we need epistles as others commending us to you or from
  you? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Because ye are our epistle
  written in our hearts, being known, being read by all men; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> ye are manifested that ye (are) an epistle of
  Christ, ministered through us, being written not in [an] ink, but in [a]
  spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables of heart of
  flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But we have such a persuasion
  through Christ towards God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> not that
  through ourselves only we are sufficient to think of a work asthat (it is)
  from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> he (lit. this) who made us worthy of ministering
  for the new testament, not of [a] writing, but of [a] spirit: for the writing
  killeth; the spirit giveth life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> If
  the ministration of (the) death, in writings, graven in stones, came to pass
  in [a] glory, so that (the) children of Israel could not look in on (the)
  face of Moses because of the glory of his face; which will be done away:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> how much rather cometh not to pass
  (the) ministration of the spirit in [a] glory? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For if the ministration of the condemnation came
  to pass in [a] glory, much rather will abound the ministration of [the]
  righteousness in [a] glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For even
  that, to which they gave glory, received not glory in this respect, because
  of the glory that passeth over beyond (lit. more). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For if that which will be done away came to pass
  through [a] glory, much more that which abideth, in [a] glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Having then such a hope, let us be in [a] great
  boldness (lit. manifestation), <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and
  not according as Moses, who putteth a covering over his face for (the)
  children of Israel not to be able to look at the glory of his face, which
  will be done away: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but their thoughts
  were hardened: for until this very day the same covering is upon the reading
  of the old testament; it not being revealed, that it will be done away in
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But until to-day, if Moses
  should be read, the covering also is over their heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But if it should turn to the Lord, he taketh away
  that covering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But the Lord is the
  spirit: the place in which (is) the spirit of the Lord, is [a] liberty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But we all with [a] face unveiled
  (lit. being revealed) look at (the) glory of the Lord in a mirror, changing
  ourselves into the same image from a glory to a glory, and it was according
  as from a spirit of the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Therefore having this ministry,
  according as mercy was shown us, we faint not: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> but we leave the hidden things of (the) shame. We
  walk not in [a] craftiness, and we use not subtlety in the word of God; but
  in the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience
  of [the] men before God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But if our
  Gospel is even (so) hidden, it is being hidden in them who will perish:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> in whom God hardened the thoughts of
  the unbelieving of this age, to cause them not to see (the) light of the
  Gospel of (the) glory of Christ, who is (the) image of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For we proclaim not ourselves, but Christ Jesus
  our Lord, but we ourselves are servants to you through Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Because God said: 'A light shall shine in (the)
  darkness,' which is this which shone in our hearts for a light of (the)
  knowledge of (the) glory of God in (the) face of Jesus Christ: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> having this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
  greatness of the powers might be that of God, and not be from you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Being oppressed in everything, but we
  are not oppressed; being cast out, but we are not cast away; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> being persecuted, but he left us not; being struck
  down, but we are not destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Always carrying (the) death of Jesus in our body, that the life also of Jesus
  may be manifested in our body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For
  always we, namely they who live, are delivered to (the) death because of
  Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our flesh which will
  die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Wherefore (the) death worked in
  us, but the life in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the same
  spirit of (the) faith is being in us, according as it is written: I believed,
  therefore I spoke '; we also believe, therefore we speak, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus shall
  raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For all things happened because of you, that the
  grace may abound and may cause the thanksgiving to abound through the many
  unto a glory of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Therefore we
  faint not; but if our outer man will perish, but the inner is made new day
  before day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For (the) lightness of
  our present tribulation worked more and more exceedingly a weight of an
  eternal glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Looking not at the
  things which we saw, but the things which we saw not: for the things which
  they see are for a time, but the things which they see not are forever.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For we know that if our house of
  our dwelling-place which is on (the) earth should be pulled clown, we have a
  building through God, an house not made with hand, eternal in the heavens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For in this we groan, yearning to
  clothe ourselves with our dwelling-place which is (lit. 'the') <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> from (the) heaven: then if we should clothe
  ourselves they will not find us naked. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For also we, namely they who are in this dwelling-place, groan, being
  burdened; not for that which we wish to strip ourselves of [it], but to
  clothe ourselves anew, that that which dieth might be swallowed up through
  (the) life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But he who worked us for
  this is God, who gave to us this earnest of the spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Being assured always, and knowing that being here
  in the body we are absent from the Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for we walked through [a] faith, not through a
  (visible) form. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But being assured, and
  well pleased rather to come out of the body, and to go to the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore, then, we strive, whether
  being here in the body or coming out of the body, that we may be pleasing to
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For we must all manifest
  ourselves before the judgement-seat of Christ; that each one may receive
  according to. the works which he did through the body, whether good or evil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Knowing the fear of the Lord we
  persuade [the] men, but we are manifested to God; but I hope that I
  manifested myself in your consciences also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> We were not commending ourselves to you again,
  but are giving to you pretext for boast about us, that it may be to you
  against them who boast themselves in (the) face, and not in (the) heart.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For whether if we were mad of heart,
  then we were mad to God; whether we are of sound mind, then we were of sound
  mind to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the love of Christ
  layeth hold on us; we having judged this: That one died for all, so then all
  died; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and he died for all, that they
  who live should not live to themselves only, but to him who died for them,
  and he rose. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Wherefore we (pron.)
  from now know not any (one) according to flesh: but if we knew Christ
  according to flesh, but now any more we know him not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Wherefore he who is in Christ is a new creature:
  the ancient things passed away; lo, new things happened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But all things are from God, he (lit. this) who
  reconciled us to himself through Christ, and he gave to us the ministry of
  the reconciliation: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> That God was
  being in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them
  their transgressions, and he put the word of the reconciliation in us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> We were ambassadors then for Christ,
  as if God gave [a] comfort through us: we beseech you, instead of Christ, be
  reconciled to God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He who knew not
  sin he made him sin for us, that we (pron.) might become righteousness of God
  in him.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But we are being fellow workers,
  and we beseech you not to receive the grace of God emptily. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For he saith: 'In a time accepted I heard thee,
  and in the day of the salvation I helped thee.' Behold now, lo, a time
  accepted; behold now, lo, a day of the salvation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> We give not any stumbling in any(thing), that our
  ministration may not be aspersed; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but
  in everything we are commending ourselves as ministers of God, in great
  patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in pains, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> in stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in toils, in
  watchings, in fastings, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> in [a]
  pureness, in [a] longsuffering, in [a] knowledge, in [a] kindness, in [a]
  holy spirit, in [a] love without hypocrisy, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> in a word of (the) truth, in a power of God.
  Through the weapons of [the] righteousness, those of the right hand and those
  of the left hand, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> through [a] glory
  and [a] dishonour, through [a] blessing and [a] curse; as deceivers and true
  (men); <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> as unknown, and known; as about
  to die, lo, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> as grieving, but rejoicing always; as poor (men),
  but making many rich; as not having anything, and we lay hold on all things.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Our mouth was opened towards you, O
  [the] Corinthians, our heart was widened out. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are
  straitened in your affections. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But I
  speak of the same recompense, as children: widen out yourselves also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Be not sharers of (the) yoke of the
  unbelievers: for what is the fellowship of [the] righteousness with [the]
  iniquity? Or what is the fellowship of the light with the darkness?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Or what is (the) agreement of Christ
  with Beliar? What is (the) part of a believer with an unbeliever?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Or what is (the) agreement of a
  temple of God with that of the idols? For we are the temple of the living
  God, according as God said: 'I shall dwell in them, and I shall walk in them;
  I shall be to them God, and they also shall be to me for a people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore come out from their midst,
  and be separated from them,' saith the Lord; touch not that which is unclean;
  and I (pron.) shall receive you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  I shall be to you for a father, and ye also shall be to me for sons and
  daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Having, then, these promises, my
  beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every pollution of (the) flesh and [a]
  spirit, completing [the] holiness in the fear of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Receive us: we did not wrong to any: we corrupted
  not any: we cheated not any. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I was not
  saying it according to a condemnation: for I said before, that ye are in our
  heart to share death and to share life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I have a great boldness of speech toward you, I
  have a great boast about you: I was full of your comfort, I abounded with
  [the] joy for all your tribulation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  For even having come to (the) Macedonia, our flesh took not any rest, but we
  were oppressed in everything; outside contentions, inside fears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But he who comforteth them who are humble, God
  comforted us in (the) coming of Titos; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  but not only in his coming, but also in the comfort, in which he was assured
  about you, showing to us your hearty love and your weeping and your zeal for
  us. So that I rejoice the more, <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  because if I gave pain to you in the epistle, I repent not, although I was
  repenting; for I see that that epistle, [that] if it grieved you, (grieved
  you) for a little (time), <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but now I
  rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved unto [a]
  repentance: for ye were grieved according to God, that ye might not suffer
  any loss from us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the grief
  according to God worked [a] repentance unto [a] salvation not to be repented
  of: but the grief of the world worketh death, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For behold the grief which ye grieved (lit, did)
  according to God worked for you much earnestness, yea a defence, yea an
  indignation, yea a fear, yea a hearty love, yea a zeal, yea a revenge; and in
  everything ye established yourselves pure of the thing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then, if I wrote to you, (I wrote) not because of
  him who did wrong, nor because of him who suffered wrong, but that your
  earnestness, this which ye feel (lit. do) about us, might be manifested to
  you before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore we
  were consoled: but about your comfort, we rejoiced more excessively about the
  joy of Titos, because his spirit was rested for you all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Because my boast which I made to him about you, I
  was not ashamed of it. But according as I spoke to you always in [a] truth,
  thus also our boast which we made about you to Titos was in [a] truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And abundantly his affections are
  turned (Toil) towards you, remembering the obedience of you all, how ye
  received him in [a] fear and [a] trembling. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I rejoice that in everything I am assured in
  you.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But I show to you, my brethren, the
  grace of God which was given to me in the churches of (the) Macedonia;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that in a great proof of a
  tribulation, the abundance of their joy and (the) depth of their poverty
  abounded into the riches of their singleness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I witness that according to their power and beyond
  their power, they acted of their own readiness, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> they prayed us in a great beseeching concerning
  the grace, and the fellowship of the ministry which is done to the saints:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and not according as we hoped, but
  they were beforehand in giving themselves to the Lord, and to us also through
  the will of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> So that we besought
  Titos, that according as be began from (the) first' thus he might complete
  this grace also in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But according
  as ye abound in everything, in the faith, and the word, and the knowledge,
  and all earnestness, and the love which is in you from us, that ye may abound
  in this grace also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I was not saying
  it according to commandment, but through the earnestness of others, I
  approved (the) choiceness of your love also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
  that he became poor because of you, being rich, that ye also in (the) poverty
  of him (that one) might become rich. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And in this I give an opinion: for this is profitable to you, who not only
  the thing to do, but the wish also ye were beforehand in beginning a year
  ago. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But now the thing also to do,
  fulfil; that according as the readiness of the wish, thus also may be the
  fulfilment, according to that which each one hath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For if the readiness exists, according to that
  which he hath he is accepted, not according to that which he hath not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For not that a relief might be to
  others and a tribulation to you, but that an equality might be in this
  present time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> That your abundance may
  be for (the) deficiency of those, and the abundance of those may be for your
  deficiency, that there may be an equality: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> according as it is written, 'He of the abundance
  abounded not, and he of the little was not in want.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But thanks be to God, he (lit. this) who gave the
  same earnestness for you in (the) heart of Titos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because he received indeed the exhortation, but
  being more in haste to come to you in his readiness of heart, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> we sent the other brother with him, he (lit.
  this) whose praise in the Gospel through all the churches; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> but not only (so), but also having had hand laid
  upon him by the churches, to travel with us in this grace, this which was
  ministered by us unto [a] glory of the Lord and our readiness of heart:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> withdrawing ourselves from this, that
  any one should [not] blame us in this amount which is ministered by us:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for we take care for good things, not
  only before the Lord, but also before [the] men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But we sent our brother also with them, he (lit.
  this) whom we approved in many things many times to be (lit. being) earnest,
  but now more eager (lit. hasting) in a great confidence which there is (to
  him) in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Whether (any enquire)
  about Titos, (he is) my friend and fellow worker for (lit. into) you: or our
  brethren, they are apostles of the churches, (the) glory of Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> (The) manifestation then of your love
  and our boast which we make about you, manifest it to them before the
  churches.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For indeed concerning the
  ministration which they do for the saints, this is superfluous for me to
  write to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for I know your
  readiness, this of which I make (a) boast about you to them of (the)
  Macedonia, that they of [the] Achaia prepared themselves a year ago; but your
  zeal gave zeal to very many of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  But we sent the brethren to you, that our boast which we make about you, may
  not be empty in this respect; that, according as I was saying, ye might be
  prepared: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> lest by any means should
  they of (the) Macedonia come with me, and find you not prepared, we (pron.)
  might be ashamed, that we should not say, Ye,' in this measure. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I thought it necessary then to exhort the
  brethren, that they should come before to you, and prepare before your
  blessing, which ye promised beforehand, that it might be prepared, but thus
  as [a] beneficence and not (as) extortion. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But this it is, that he who is sparing (in) sowing
  shall reap also sparingly; and he who soweth beneficently shall reap also
  beneficently: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> each one according as he
  chose for himself in his heart, not grudgingly or from a 'necessity: for a
  rejoicing giver (it is) whom God loveth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But it is possible for God to make all grace
  multiply to you, that (the) sufficiency, being to you in everything always,
  ye may abound in every good thing: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  according as it is written: 'He distributed, he gave to the pool; his
  righteousness abideth for ever.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But
  he who supplieth, the seed to him who soweth shall supply the bread also to
  him for [an] eating; and he shall cause your plants to grow; he shall cause
  them to grow, namely the fruits of your righteousness: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> ye being rich in everything, in all singleness,
  this which worketh through us a thanksgiving to God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Because this ministration of this service not
  only is (at work) filling up the wants of the saints [only], but also
  aboundeth through many thanksgivings to God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> through the proof of this ministration. Ye are
  glorifying God for the subjection of your confession unto the Gospel of
  Christ, and the singleness of the fellowship with them and all; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and their prayer which they make for you, being
  in hearty love to you, because of the grace of God, which aboundeth in you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But thanks be given to God for his
  free gift unspeakable.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But I Paul beseech you through the
  meekness and the fairness of Christ, as being humble indeed among you in your
  presence; but being away from you I have firmness among you: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> but I pray to have firmness, not being with you,
  in this confidence, this with which I think to be bold against some, these
  who think of us that we walked according to flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For we walked according to flesh, (yet) we were
  not (serving as) soldiers according to flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For the weapons of your soldiering are not carnal,
  but they are powers of God, unto an overthrowing of the things which are
  strong, unto a hurling down of arguments, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and all heights which raise themselves against the
  knowledge of God, and we are leading captive all thoughts into (the)
  obedience of Christ; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and being
  prepared to avenge all disobedience, if your obedience should be filled
  first. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> (Is it) that ye look at the
  things which are in your presence? He who trusteth that he is of Christ, let
  him argue this again in himself, that, according as he is of Christ, thus are
  we also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For if I should boast myself
  more about the authority which the Lord gave to me unto [an] edification, and
  not unto your ruin, I shall (lit. will) not be ashamed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> That I may not be as one frightening you through
  the epistles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because the epistles
  indeed are weighty and they are strong; but the presence of the body is weak,
  and the words contemptible. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> This
  again let such a one think, that, according as we are in (the) word through
  the epistles, not being with you, this is as we are in (the) deed, being with
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For we are not bold to compare
  ourselves or to measure ourselves with some who commend themselves: but they
  (pron.) in themselves are measuring themselves, and are comparing themselves
  with themselves, and are not understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But we (pron.) were not boasting ourselves in
  things without measure, but according to the measure of the canon which God
  ordained to us, to cause us to reach unto it in a measure, and one as far as
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For not as not reaching to you
  we stretch (out) ourselves to you the more: for we reached to you also in the
  Gospel of Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> not boasting
  ourselves in unmeasuredness (plural), in toils of other men but having a
  hope, should your faith grow, to cause it to become great in you, according
  to our canon unto an abundance, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> to
  preach glad tidings to you, things which are greater than those, not in a
  canon of other men (and) to boast ourselves of the things which were
  prepared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But he who boasteth
  himself, let him boast himself in the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For not he who commendeth himself is the chosen,
  but he whom the Lord will commend.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Would that ye were to bear with me
  a little in my senselessness: but be longsuffering with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For I am jealous over you in a jealousy of God:
  for I united you to one husband a pure virgin to Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But I fear lest by any means as the serpent
  deceived Eva in his craftiness, your thoughts may be corrupted from the
  singleness and the pureness which is in Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For if indeed he who cometh will proclaim to you
  another Jesus (whom) we proclaimed [him] not, or ye will receive another
  spirit (whom) ye received [him]: not, or another Gospel (which) ye accepted
  [it] not, well forsooth will ye bear with (him). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For I think that I am in want of nothing in
  comparison with the apostles who surpass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> If I am an unlearned one in (the) word,. but not
  in (the) knowledge; but in everything we manifested ourselves to you among
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Is it a sin which I did (in),
  humiliating myself, that ye might be exalted, because I proclaimed to you
  freely the Gospel of God ? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I robbed
  churches; I took wages because of ministering to you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and being with you, having been in want, I put not
  burden upon one of you; for my deficiency the brethren who came from (the)
  Macedonia filled it up; and in everything I kept myself, being unburden-some
  to (lit. from) you, and I shall keep (so) still . <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The truth of Christ is in me, that this boast
  will not be shut off from me in the places of [the] Achaia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Why? Because I love you not. God knoweth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But that which I do, I shall (lit.
  will) do it still, that I may cut off (the) pretext of them who wish to find
  pretext; that they may be found in that in which they boast themselves
  according as ourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For these are
  as false apostles, workers of subtlety, changing themselves into (the) form
  of apostles of Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And it is not
  a wonder. Satan also himself changeth himself into (the) form of an angel of
  (the) light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> It is not then a great
  (thing) if his ministers also change themselves into (the) form of ministers
  of [the] righteousness, these whose end will be according to their works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Again I say, lest by any means one
  should think of me, that I am foolish,--nay, even though as foolish receive
  me, that I may boast myself also a little. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> That which I speak, I was saying it not according
  to the Lord, but as in [a] foolishness, in this measure of this boast.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Since many boast themselves according
  to flesh, I also shall (lit. will) boast myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For gladly ye bear with the foolish, ye (being)
  wise. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For ye bear with him who maketh
  you slaves, he who devoureth (lit. eateth) you, he who receiveth from you, he
  who exalteth himself, and he who siniteth in your face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> According to a dishonour I say that we (pron.)
  were weak. That in which any one will be bold, I said it in [a] foolishness,
  I shall (lit, will) be bold also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  They are Hebrews, I am also. They are Israelites, I am also. They are seeds
  of Abram, I am also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> They are
  'ministers of Christ. I spoke in [a] madness, I am more; in toils more, in
  stripes more, in prisons in an excess, in deaths many times <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> by the Jews. For I received five (times) forty
  stripes save one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> I was stretched out
  for (the) rod three times, I was stoned once, I was shipwrecked three times,
  I spent a day and a night in (the) deep of the sea; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> in walkings on (the) road many times; I was in
  danger in rivers, I was in danger of robbers, I was in danger of them of my
  nation, I was in danger of Gentiles, I was in danger in cities, I was in
  danger on (the) desert, I was in danger in the sea, I was in danger of false
  brethren; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> in toils and in pains, in
  watchings many times, in hunger (plur.) and [a] thirst. In fastings many
  times, in cold (plur.) and nakedness (plur.). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Without the things which are outside, (the) care
  of all the churches is coming upon me daily. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to
  stumble, and I burn not? <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> If it is
  right that I should boast myself, I would boast myself in my feeblenesses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> God and the Father of our Lord Jesus
  Christ (is he) who kno weth, he who is blessed unto the ages, that I shall
  (lit. will) not say falsehood: <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> that
  in Damascos (the) ruler of the Gentiles of Areta (the) king was guarding
  (the) city of them of Damascos, wishing to seize me: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> and I was let down from (lit. in) a window, in a
  basket, from upon the wall: I was saved from his hands.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But it is not profitable indeed to
  boast; but I shall (lit. will) come upon visions also and revelations of the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I know a man in Christ fourteen
  years before, whether in body I know riot; or outside of body I know not; God
  knoweth, that such a one was carried away unto the third heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I know such a man, whether in body or outside
  of body I know not; God knoweth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that
  he was carried away to the Paradisos, and he heard words unspeakable, which
  it is not lawful that a man should speak. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I would boast myself about such a one: but about
  myself I shall (lit. will) not boast myself except perhaps in the weaknesses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For should I wish to boast myself I
  shall (lit. will) not become foolish; for I say (the) truth: I spare (you),
  lest by any means one should think of me beyond that which he seeth (of) me,
  or that which he heareth from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  in (the) abundance of the revelations, therefore, that I should not exalt
  myself, a piercing thorn was given in my flesh, namely an angel of Satan that
  he might buffet me, that I should not exalt myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I prayed the Lord three times about this, that he
  might depart from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to
  me: It is sufficient for thee with this grace: for my power was completed in
  the weakness.' It is pleasing to me then rather to boast myself in the
  weaknesses, that the power of Christ may be upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in
  injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in tribulations for Christ: for if
  I should be weak, then I take courage. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I became foolish: ye (pron.) compelled me; for I
  (pron.) ought (imperf.) to have been commended by you: for I was not
  deficient in anything in comparison with the apostles who surpass. If indeed
  I (am) nothing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the signs of the
  apostleship were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and
  powers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For what is that in which ye
  were deficient as regards (the) rest of the churches, except that I (pron.)
  was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrongdoing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> This is (the) third time that I am ready to come
  to you; and I shall not be burdensome to you: for I was not seeking for
  yours, but for you: for the children ought not to lay up (lit. throw in) for
  the fathers, but the fathers for the children. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I (pron.) am well pleased to spend and to
  overspend for your souls, if I love you more I am loved myself the less (lit.
  a little). <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But be it (so), I (pron.)
  put not burden upon you, but being crafty I took you with [a] subtlety.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Saw ye one of them whom I sent to
  you, through whom I did you wrong ? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I
  besought Titos, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titos wrong you at
  all? Walked we not in the same spirit? Are they not the same steps?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Again, ye think that we answer you.
  Before God we speak in Christ. But all things, my beloved, for your edifying.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But I fear lest by any means, should
  I come, I may find you as I wish not; and I also, that ye find me as ye wish
  not; lest by any means there is strife or jealousy or anger or faction or
  slandering or whispering or tumult or pride; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> lest again should I come to you my God may
  humiliate me, and I should mourn for many of them who sinned in time past,
  and they repented not for the uncleanness and the fornication and the
  defilement which they did.</p>

  <h3 id="second_epistle_to_the_corinthians13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> This is the third time (lit. three
  of time) I am coming to you. From the mouth of witnesses two or three all
  words shall stand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I said from (the)
  beginning, and I am before in saying again, as being with you (the) second
  time; and now again not being with you, (the) third time, I say to them who
  sinned from (the) beginning and all the rest: That if I should come this
  other time I shall (lit. will) not spare any more; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> because ye seek for (the) proof of him who
  speaketh in me, Christ; he (lit. this) who is not weak toward you, but is
  powerful in you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> for also he was
  crucified from [a] weakness, but he liveth in [a] power of God. For we also
  are weak with him, but we shall also live with him from [a] power of God
  toward you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Try your own selves,
  whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not that
  Christ Jesus is in you, except perhaps that ye (are) reprobates? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But I hope that ye will know that we (are) not
  reprobates. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But we pray God that ye
  may not do any evil, not that we (pron.) may be manifest as chosen, but that
  ye (pron.) may do the good, but that we (pron.) may be as reprobates.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For we shall (lit. will) not be able
  to fight (lit. give) against (the) truth (Amu), but for the truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For we (pron.) rejoice should we be
  weak, but ye be powerful. This very thing also we do, praying for your
  perfection. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore I write these
  things to you not being with you, that being with you, I may not act
  severely, according to the authority which the Lord gave to me for [an]
  edification, and not for [an] overthrowing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Finally, my brethren, rejoice; be perfected; take
  courage; be (of) one thought; be (at) peace. God of [the] love and [the]
  peace shall be with you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Salute one
  another in a holy kiss. All the saints salute you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> (The) grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
  love of God, and the fellowship of the holy spirit with you all.</p>
