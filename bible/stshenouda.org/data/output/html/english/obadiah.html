  <h2 id="obadiah">Obadiah</h2><a href="#obadiah1">1</a>
  <h3 id="obadiah1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The vision of
  Obdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Idumea; I have heard a report from the
  Lord, and he has sent forth a message to the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Arise ye, and let us rise up against her to war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Behold, I have made thee small among
  the Gentiles: thou art greatly dishonoured. The pride of thine heart has
  elated thee, dwelling as thou dost in the holes of the rocks, as one that
  exalts his habitation, saying in his heart, Who will bring me down to the
  ground? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If thou shouldest mount up as
  the eagle, and if thou shouldest make thy nest among the stars, thence will I
  bring thee down, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If
  thieves came in to thee, or robbers by night, where wouldest thou have been
  cast away? would they not have stolen just enough for themselves? and if
  grape-gatherers went in to thee, would they not leave a gleaning?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> How has Esau been searched out, and
  how have his hidden things been detected? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They sent thee to thy coasts: all the men of thy
  covenant have withstood thee; thine allies have prevailed against thee, they
  have set snares under thee: they have no understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In that day, saith the Lord, I will destroy the
  wise men out of Idumea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And thy warriors from Thaeman shall be
  dismayed, to the end that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Because of the slaughter and the sin
  committed against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt
  be cut off for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> From the day
  that thou stoodest in opposition to him, in the days when foreigners were
  taking captive his forces, and strangers entered into his gates, and cast
  lots on Jerusalem, thou also wast as one of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thou shouldest not have looked on the day of
  thy brother in the day of strangers; nor shouldest thou have rejoiced against
  the children of Juda in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou
  have boasted in the day of their affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Neither shouldest thou have gone into the gates
  of the people in the day of their troubles; nor yet shouldest thou have
  looked upon their gathering in the day of their destruction, nor shouldest
  thou have attacked their host in the day of their perishing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Neither shouldest thou have stood at the opening
  of their passages, to destroy utterly those of them that were escaping;
  neither shouldest thou have shut up his fugitives in the day of affliction.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For the day of the Lord is near upon
  all the Gentiles: as thou have done, so shall it be done to thee: thy
  recompense shall be returned on thine own head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For as thou hast drunk upon my holy mountain, so
  shall all the nations drink wine; they shall drink, and go down, and be as if
  they were not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But on mount Sion
  there shall be deliverance, and there shall be a sanctuary; and the house of
  Jacob shall take for an inheritance those that took them for an inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the house of Jacob shall be fire,
  and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau shall be for stubble;
  and Israel shall flame forth against them, and shall devour them, and there
  shall not be a corn-field left to the house of Esau; because the Lord has
  spoken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And they that dwell in the
  south shall inherit the mount of Esau, and they in the plain the Philistines:
  and they shall inherit the mount of Ephraim, and the plain of Samaria, and
  Benjamin, and the land of Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  this shall be the domain of the captivity of the children of Israel, the land
  of the Chananites as far as Sarepta; and the captives of Jerusalem shall
  inherit as far as Ephratha; they shall inherit the cities of the south.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they that escape shall come up
  from mount Sion, to take vengeance on the mount of Esau; and the kingdom
  shall be the Lordâ€™s.
