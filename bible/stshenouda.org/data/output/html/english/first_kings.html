  <h3 id="first_kings2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the
  days of David drew near that he should die: and he addressed his son Solomon,
  saying, I go the way of all the earth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  but be thou strong, and shew thyself a man; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk
  in his ways, to keep the commandments and the ordinances and the judgments
  which are written in the law of Moses; that thou mayest understand what thou
  shalt do in all things that I command thee: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> that the Lord may confirm his word which he spoke,
  saying, If thy children shall take heed to their way to walk before me in
  truth with all their heart, I promise thee, saying, there shall not fail thee
  a man on the throne of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Moreover thou knowest all that Joab the son of Saruia did to me, what he did
  to the two captains of the forces of Israel, to Abenner the son of Ner, and
  to Amessai the son of Jether, that he slew them, and shed the blood of war in
  peace, and put innocent blood on his girdle that was about his loins, and on
  his sandal that was on his foot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Therefore thou shalt deal with him according to thy wisdom, and thou shalt
  not bring down his grey hairs in peace to the grave. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But thou shalt deal kindly with the sons of
  Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those that eat at thy table;
  for thus they drew nigh to me when I fled from the face of thy brother
  Abessalom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And, behold, there is with
  thee Semei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Baurim: and he cursed me with a
  grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to
  Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put
  thee to death with the sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But thou
  shalt by no means hold him guiltless, for thou art a wise man, and wilt know
  what thou shalt do to him, and shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to
  the grave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And David slept with his
  fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the days which David reigned over Israel were
  forty years; he reigned seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in
  Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Solomon sat on the
  throne of his father David, and his kingdom was established greatly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Adonias the son of Aggith came in
  to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her: and she said,
  Dost thou enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have business with thee. And she said to him,
  Say on. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said to her, Thou
  knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me
  for a king; but the kingdom was turned from me and became my brotherâ€™s: for
  it was appointed to him from the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And now I make one request of thee, do not turn
  away thy face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak on. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said to her, Speak, I pray thee, to king
  Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from thee, and let him give me
  Abisag the Somanite for a wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to
  him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and
  sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she
  sat on his right hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And she said
  to him, I ask of thee one little request; turn not away my face from thee.
  And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And she said, Let, I pray thee,
  Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias thy brother to wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And king Solomon answered and said to his mother,
  And why hast thou asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for
  he is my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and
  Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God
  do so to me, and more also, if it be not that Adonias has spoken this word
  against his own life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And now as the
  Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father
  David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias
  be put to death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So king Solomon sent
  by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he slew him, and Adonias died in
  that day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the king said to
  Abiathar the priest, Depart thou quickly to Anathoth to thy farm, for thou
  art worthy of death this day; but I will not slay thee, because thou hast
  borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because thou
  was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest
  of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke
  concerning the house of Heli in Selom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for
  Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled
  to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab
  has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and lo! he has hold of the horns of
  the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails thee, that thou
  hast fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, and fled
  for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and
  slay him, and bury him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Banaeas
  son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him,
  Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I
  will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king,
  saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he
  has spoken, and kill him: and thou shalt bury him, and thou shalt remove this
  day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my
  father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the Lord has returned
  upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked
  two men more righteous and better than himself, and slew them with the sword,
  and my father David knew not of their blood, even Abenner the son of Ner the
  commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the
  commander-in-chief of Juda. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And their
  blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but
  to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for
  ever from the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> So Banaeas son of
  Jodae went up, and attacked him, and slew him, and buried him in his house in
  the wilderness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the king
  appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom
  was established in Jerusalem; and as for Sadoc the priest, the king appointed
  him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David
  reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to
  Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the
  sea-shore. And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom
  of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt: and he took the
  daughter of Pharao, and brought her into the city of David, until he had
  finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the
  wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished them. And
  Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of
  stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great
  lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea-
  and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall
  of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of
  David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and
  Solomon offered up three whole-burnt-offerings in the year, and
  peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense
  before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who
  presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of
  the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer,
  and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the
  Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these
  cities. And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold,
  there is with thee Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of Benjamin out of
  Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the
  camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord,
  saying, He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not thou hold him
  guiltless, for thou art a man of understanding, and thou wilt know what thou
  shalt do to him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the
  grave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the king called Semei, and
  said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt
  not go out thence any whither. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And it
  shall come to pass in the day that thou shalt go forth and cross over the
  brook Kedron, know assuredly that thou shalt certainly die: thy blood shall
  be upon thine head. And the king caused him to swear in that day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Semei said to the king, Good is
  the word that thou hast spoken, my lord O king: thus will thy servant do. And
  Semei dwelt in Jerusalem three years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran
  away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying,
  Behold, thy servants are in Geth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And
  Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out
  his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And it was told Solomon, saying,
  Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And the king sent and called Semei,
  and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by the Lord, and testify to thee,
  saying, In whatsoever day thou shalt go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right
  or left, know certainly that thou shalt assuredly die? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And why hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord,
  and the commandment which I commanded thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the king said to Semei, Thou knowest all thy
  mischief which thy heart knows, which thou didst to David my father: and the
  Lord has recompensed thy mischief on thine own head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And king Solomon is blessed, and the throne of
  David shall be established before the Lord for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae,
  and he went forth and slew him. And king Solomon was very prudent and wise:
  and Juda and Israel were very many, as the sand which is by the sea for
  multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all
  the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his
  life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae
  in the wilderness. And this was the daily provision of Solomon, thirty
  measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves,
  and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and
  does, and choice fed birds. For he ruled in all the country on this side the
  river, from Raphi unto Gaza, over all the kings on this side the river: and
  he was at peace on all sides round about; and Juda and Israel dwelt safely,
  every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinand feasting,
  from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon. And these were the
  princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan
  chief of the officers, and he went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and
  Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and
  Achire son of Edrai was over the levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the
  household and over the brickwork, and Cachur the son of Nathan was
  counsellor. And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and
  twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and
  to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the
  son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.
  <h3 id="first_kings8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it
  came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his
  own house after twenty years, then king Solomon assembled all the elders of
  Israel in Sion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city
  of David, this is Sion, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> in the month
  of Athanin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the priests took up
  the ark, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and the tabernacle of
  testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the king and all Israel were
  occupied before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, without number.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the priests bring in the ark into
  its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under
  the wings of the cherubs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the
  cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs
  covered the ark and its holy things above. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the holy staves projected, and the ends of the
  holy staves appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were
  not seen without. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> There was nothing in
  the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which
  Moses put there in Choreb, which tables the Lord made as a covenant with the
  children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it came to pass when the priests departed out
  of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the priests could not stand to minister
  because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the
  king turned his face, and the king blessed all Israel, (and the whole
  assembly of Israel stood:) <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and he
  said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel to-day, who spoke by his mouth
  concerning David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hands, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> From the day that I brought out my
  people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any one tribe of
  Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose
  Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my
  people Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it was in the
  heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the Lord said to David my father,
  Forasmuch as it came into thine heart to build a house to my name, thou didst
  well that it came upon thine heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that has proceeded
  out of thy bowels, he shall build the house to my name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord has confirmed the word that he
  spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down
  on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the
  name of the Lord God of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I
  have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord,
  which the Lord made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of
  Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Solomon stood up in front
  of the altar before all the congregation of Israel; and he spread out his
  hands toward heaven: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and he said,
  Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven above and on the
  earth beneath, keeping covenant and mercy with thy servant who walks before
  thee with all his heart; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> which thou
  hast kept toward thy servant David my father: for thou hast spoken by thy
  mouth and thou hast fulfilled it with thine hands, as at this day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep
  for thy servant David my father, the promises which thou hast spoken to him,
  saying, There shall not be taken from thee a man sitting before me on the
  throne of Israel, provided only thy children shall take heed to their ways,
  to walk before me as thou hast walked before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And now, O Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee,
  thy word to David my father be confirmed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But will God indeed dwell with men upon the
  earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, how much
  less even this house which I have built to thy name? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Yet, O Lord God of Israel, thou shalt look upon
  my petition, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays to thee in thy
  presence this day, <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> that thine eyes
  may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place which thou
  saidst, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays at
  this place day and night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And thou
  shalt hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which
  they shall pray toward this place; and thou shalt hear in thy dwelling-place
  in heaven, and thou shalt do and be gracious. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Whatsoever trespasses any one shall commit
  against his neighbor,â€”and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should
  swear, and he shall come and make confession before thine altar in this
  house, <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> then shalt thou hear from
  heaven, and do, and thou shalt judge thy people Israel, that the wicked
  should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the
  righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> When thy people Israel falls before enemies,
  because they shall sin against thee, and they shall return and confess to thy
  name, and they shall pray and supplicate in this house, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> then shalt thou hear from heaven, and be gracious
  to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land
  which thou gavest to their fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  When the heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall sin
  against thee, and the shall pray toward this place, and they shall make
  confession to thy name, and shall turn from their sins when thou shalt have
  humbled them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> then thou shalt hear
  from heaven, and be merciful to the sins of thy servant and of thy people
  Israel; for thou shalt shew them the good way to walk in it, and thou shalt
  give rain upon the earth which thou hast given to thy people for an
  inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> If there should be
  famine, if there should be death, because there should be blasting, locust,
  or if there be mildew, and if their enemy oppress them in any one of their
  cities, with regard to every calamity, every trouble, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> every prayer, every supplication whatever shall
  be made by any man, as they shall know each the plague of his heart, and
  shall spread abroad his hands to this house, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> then shalt thou hearken from heaven, out of thine
  established dwelling-place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt do, and
  recompense to every man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart,
  for thou alone knowest the heart of all the children of men: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> that they may fear thee all the days that they
  live upon the land, which thou hast given to our fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And for the stranger who is not of thy people,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> when they shall come and pray toward
  this place, <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> then shalt thou hear them
  from heaven, out of thine established dwelling-place, and thou shalt do
  according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for, that all the
  nations may know thy name, and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and may
  know that thy name has been called on this house which I have builded.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> If it be that thy people shall go
  forth to war against their enemies in the way by which thou shalt turn them,
  and pray in the name of the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and
  the house which I have built to thy name, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> then shalt thou hear from heaven their
  supplication and their prayer, and shalt execute judgment for them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> If it be that they shall sin against
  thee, (for there is not a man who will not sin,) and thou shalt bring them
  and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive
  shall carry them to a land far or near, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> and they shall turn their hearts in the land
  whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their
  sojourning, and supplicate thee, saying, We have sinned, we have done
  unjustly, we have transgressed, <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> and
  they shall turn to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the
  land of their enemies whither thou hast carried them captives, and shall pray
  to thee toward their land which thou hast given to their fathers, and the
  city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> then shalt thou hear from heaven
  thine established dwelling-place, <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> and
  thou shalt be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed
  against thee, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have
  transgressed against thee, and thou shalt cause them to be pitied before them
  that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> for they are thy people and thine
  inheritance, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst
  of the furnace of iron. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And let thine
  eyes and thine ears be opened to the supplication of thy servant, and to the
  supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all things for which
  they shall call upon thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Because
  thou hast set them apart for an inheritance to thyself out of all the nations
  of the earth, as thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, when thou
  broughtest our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord God.â€”Then spoke
  Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building itâ€”He manifested
  the sun in the heaven: the Lord said he would dwell in darkness: build thou
  my house, a beautiful house for thyself to dwell in anew. Behold, is not this
  written in the book of the song? <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And
  it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer
  and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, after
  having knelt upon his knees, and his hands were spread out towards heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And he stood, and blessed all the
  congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(56)</span> Blessed be the Lord this day, who has given rest
  to his people Israel, according to all that he said: there has not failed one
  word among all his good words which he spoke by the hand of his servant
  Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> May the Lord our God be with
  us, as he was with our fathers; let him not desert us nor turn from us,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> that he may turn our hearts toward
  him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his
  ordinances which he commanded our fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And let these words, which I have prayed before
  the Lord our God, be near to the Lord our God day and night, to maintain the
  cause of thy servant, and the cause of thy people Israel for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> that all the nations of the earth may
  know that the Lord God, he is God, and there is none beside. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our
  God, to walk also holily in his ordinances, and to keep his commandments, as
  at this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And the king and all the
  children of Israel offered sacrifice before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And king Solomon offered for the sacrifices of
  peace-offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen,
  and hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of
  Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(64)</span> In that day the king consecrated the middle of
  the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the
  whole-burnt-offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace-offerings,
  because the brazen altar which was before the Lord was too little to bear the
  whole-burnt-offering and the sacrifices of peace-offerings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all
  Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hemath to the
  river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating
  and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And on the eighth day he sent away the people:
  and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and
  their heart was glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to
  his servant David, and to Israel his people.
  <h3 id="first_kings9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it
  came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and
  the kingâ€™s house, and all the work of Solomon, whatever he wished to perform,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that the Lord appeared to Solomon a
  second time, as he appeared in Gabaon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and thy
  supplication which thou madest before me: I have done for thee according to
  all thy prayer: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my
  name there for ever, and mine eyes and my heart shall be there always.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if thou wilt walk before me as
  David thy father walked, in holiness of heart and uprightness, and so as to
  do according to all that I commanded him, and shalt keep my ordinances and my
  commandments: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> then will I establish
  the throne of thy kingdom in Israel for ever, as I spoke to David thy father,
  saying, There shall not fail thee a man to rule in Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But if ye or your children do in any wise revolt
  from me, and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances, which Moses set
  before you, and ye go and serve other gods, and worship them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> then will I cut off Israel from the land which I
  have given them, and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will
  cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a desolation and a by-word to all
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And this house, which is
  high, shall be so that every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall
  hiss; and they shall say, Wherefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and
  to this house? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And men shall say,
  Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought out their fathers from
  Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and they attached themselves to strange
  gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore the Lord has brought
  this evil upon them. Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of
  the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> During twenty years in which Solomon
  was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the
  king, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Chiram king of Tyre helped
  Solomon with cedar wood, and fir wood, and with gold, and all that he wished
  for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> So Chiram departed from Tyre, and
  went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they
  pleased him not. And he said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> What
  are these cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them
  Boundary until this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Chiram
  brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> even that for which king Solomon built a ship in
  Gasion Gaber near Ã†lath on the shore of the extremity of the sea in the land
  of Edom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Chiram sent in the ship
  together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row,
  men acquainted with the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they
  came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
  brought them to king Solomon.
  <h3 id="first_kings17">17</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Eliu
  the prophet, the Thesbite of Thesbae of Galaad, said to Achaab, As the Lord
  God of hosts, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not
  be these years dew nor rain, except by the word of my mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the word of the Lord came to Eliu, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Depart hence eastward, and hide thee
  by the brook of Chorrath, that is before Jordan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And it shall be that thou shalt drink water of the
  brook, and I will charge the ravens to feed thee there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Eliu did according to the word of the Lord,
  and he sat by the brook of Chorrath before Jordan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the ravens brought him loaves in the morning,
  and flesh in the evening and he drank water of the brook. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it came to pass after some time, that the
  brook was dried up, because there had been no rain upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the word of the Lord came to Eliu,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Arise, and go to Sarepta of
  the Sidonian land: behold, I have there commanded a widow-woman to maintain
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he arose and went to
  Sarepta, and came to the gate of the city: and, behold, a widow-woman was
  there gathering sticks; and Eliu cried after her, and said to her, Fetch me,
  I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And she went to fetch it; and Eliu cried after
  her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of the bread that is in thy
  hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the woman said, As the Lord
  thy God lives, I have not a cake, but only a handful of meal in the pitcher,
  and a little oil in a cruse, and, behold, I am going to gather two sticks,
  and I shall go in and dress it for myself and my children, and we shall eat
  it and die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Eliu said to her, Be
  of good courage, go in and do according to thy word: but make me thereof a
  little cake, and thou shalt bring it out to me first, and thou shalt make
  some for thyself and thy children last. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For thus saith the Lord, The pitcher of meal
  shall not fail, and the cruse of oil shall not diminish, until the day that
  the Lord gives rain upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the woman went and did so, and did eat, she, and he, and her children.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the pitcher of meal failed not,
  and the cruse of oil was not diminished, according to the word of the Lord
  which he spoke by the hand of Eliu. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And it came to pass afterward, that the son of the woman the mistress of the
  house was sick; and his sickness was very severe, until there was no breath
  left in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And she said to Eliu,
  What have I to do with thee, O man of God? hast thou come in to me to bring
  my sins to remembrance, and to slay my son? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Eliu said to the woman, Give me thy son. And
  he took him out of her bosom, and took him up to the chamber in which he
  himself lodged, and laid him on the bed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Eliu cried aloud, and said, Alas, O Lord, the
  witness of the widow with whom I sojourn, thou hast wrought evil for her in
  slaying her son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he breathed on
  the child thrice, and called on the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I
  pray thee, the soul of this child return to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it was so, and the child cried out,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and he brought him down from the
  upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; and Eliu said, See,
  thy son lives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the woman said to
  Eliu, Behold, I know that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in
  thy mouth is true.
