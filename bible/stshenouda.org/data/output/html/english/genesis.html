  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> IN the beginning God made the
  heaven and the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But the earth
  was unsightly and unfurnished, and darkness was over the deep, and the Spirit
  of God moved over the water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And God
  said, Let there be light, and there was light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And God saw the light that it was good, and God
  divided between the light and the darkness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
  called Night, and there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And God said, Let there be a firmament
  in the midst of the water, and let it be a division between water and water,
  and it was so. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And God made the
  firmament, and God divided between the water which was under the firmament
  and the water which was above the firmament. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And God called the firmament Heaven, and God saw
  that it was good, and there was evening and there was morning, the second
  day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God said, Let the water which
  is under the heaven be collected into one place, and let the dry land appear,
  and it was so. And the water which was under the heaven was collected into
  its places, and the dry land appeared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And God called the dry land Earth, and the
  gatherings of the waters he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And God said, Let the earth bring
  forth the herb of grass bearing seed according to its kind and according to
  its likeness, and the fruit-tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, according
  to its kind on the earth, and it was so. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the earth brought forth the herb of grass
  bearing seed according to its kind and according to its likeness, and the
  fruit tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, according to its kind on the
  earth, and God saw that it was good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And God said, Let there be lights in the
  firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, to divide between day
  and night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for
  years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And let them be for light in
  the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth, and it was so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And God made the two great lights,
  the greater light for regulating the day and the lesser light for regulating
  the night, the stars also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And God
  placed them in the firmament of the heaven, so as to shine upon the earth,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and to regulate day and night, and to
  divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And there was evening and there was
  morning, the fourth day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And God
  said, Let the waters bring forth reptiles having life, and winged creatures
  flying above the earth in the firmament of heaven, and it was so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And God made great whales, and every
  living reptile, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and
  every creature that flies with wings according to its kind, and God saw that
  they were good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And God blessed them,
  saying, Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the
  creatures that fly be multiplied on the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And there was evening and there was morning, the
  fifth day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And God said, Let the
  earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind, quadrupeds and
  reptiles and wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and it was so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And God made the wild beasts of the
  earth according to their kind, and cattle according to their kind, and all
  the reptiles of the earth according to their kind, and God saw that they were
  good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And God said, Let us make man
  according to our image and likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish
  of the sea, and over the flying creatures of heaven, and over the cattle and
  all the earth, and over all the reptiles that creep on the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And God made man, according to the
  image of God he made him, male and female he made them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And God blessed them, saying, Increase and
  multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish
  of the seas and flying creatures of heaven, and all the cattle and all the
  earth, and all the reptiles that creep on the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And God said, Behold I have given to you every
  seed-bearing herb sowing seed which is upon all the earth, and every tree
  which has in itself the fruit of seed that is sown, to you it shall be for
  food. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And to all the wild beasts of
  the earth, and to all the flying creatures of heaven, and to every reptile
  creeping on the earth, which has in itself the breath of life, even every
  green plant for food; and it was so. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  And God saw all the things that he had made, and, behold, they were very
  good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the heavens and the earth were
  finished, and the whole world of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And God finished on the sixth day his works which he made, and he ceased on
  the seventh day from all his works which he made. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it,
  because in it he ceased from all his works which God began to do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> This is the book of the generation of
  heaven and earth, when they were made, in the day in which the Lord God made
  the heaven and the earth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and every
  herb of the field before it was on the earth, and all the grass of the field
  before it sprang up, for God had not rained on the earth, and there was not a
  man to cultivate it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But there rose a
  fountain out of the earth, and watered the whole face of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And God formed the man of dust of the
  earth, and breathed upon his face the breath of life, and the man became a
  living soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And God planted a garden
  eastward in Edem, and placed there the man whom he had formed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God made to spring up also out of the earth
  every tree beautiful to the eye and good for food, and the tree of life in
  the midst of the garden, and the tree of learning the knowledge of good and
  evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And a river proceeds out of
  Edem to water the garden, thence it divides itself into four heads.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The name of the one, Phisom, this it
  is which encircles the whole land of Evilat, where there is gold.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the gold of that land is good,
  there also is carbuncle and emerald. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And the name of the second river is Geon, this it is which encircles the
  whole land of Ethiopia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the third
  river is Tigris, this is that which flows forth over against the Assyrians.
  And the fourth river is Euphrates. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the Lord God took the man whom he had formed, and placed him in the
  garden of Delight, to cultivate and keep it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying,
  Of every tree which is in the garden thou mayest freely eat, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—
   of it ye shall not eat, but in whatsoever day ye eat of it, ye shall surely
  die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the Lord God said, It is not
  good that the man should be alone, let us make for him a help suitable to
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And God formed yet farther out
  of the earth all the wild beasts of the field, and all the birds of the sky,
  and he brought them to Adam, to see what he would call them, and whatever
  Adam called any living creature, that was the name of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all
  the birds of the sky, and to all the wild beasts of the field, but for Adam
  there was not found a help like to himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And God brought a trance upon Adam, and he slept,
  and he took one of his ribs, and filled up the flesh instead thereof.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And God formed the rib which he took
  from Adam into a woman, and brought her to Adam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and
  flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of
  her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore shall a man
  leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they two
  shall be one flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3:1)</span> And the two were
  naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Now the serpent was the most crafty
  of all the brutes on the earth, which the Lord God made, and the serpent said
  to the woman, Wherefore has God said, Eat not of every tree of the garden?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the woman said to the serpent, We
  may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst
  of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
  lest ye die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the serpent said to
  the woman, Ye shall not surely die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  For God knew that in whatever day ye should eat of it your eyes would be
  opened, and ye would be as gods, knowing good and evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the woman saw that the tree was good for food,
  and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to
  contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her
  husband also with her, and they ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And the eyes of both were opened and they perceived that they were naked, and
  they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons to go round them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they heard the voice of the Lord
  God walking in the garden in the afternoon; and both Adam and his wife hid
  themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the
  garden. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord God called Adam
  and said to him, Adam, where art thou? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he said to him, I heard thy voice as thou
  walkedst in the garden, and I feared because I was naked and I hid myself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And God said to him, Who told thee
  that thou wast naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree concerning which I
  charged thee of it alone not to eat? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And Adam said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me—she gave me of the
  tree and I ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord God said
  to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent
  deceived me and I ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord
  God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above
  all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on thy breast and belly thou
  shalt go, and thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman
  and between thy seed and her seed, he shall watch against thy head, and thou
  shalt watch against his heel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And to
  the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings; in
  pain thou shalt bring forth children, and thy submission shall be to thy
  husband, and he shall rule over thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,
  and eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it only not to eat—
  of that thou hast eaten, cursed is the ground in thy labours, in pain shalt
  thou eat of it all the days of thy life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee,
  and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread
  until thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken, for earth thou
  art and to earth thou shalt return. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all
  living. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the Lord God made for
  Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of
  us, to know good and evil, and now lest at any time he stretch forth his
  hand, and take of the tree of life and eat, and so he shall live for ever—
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> So the Lord God sent him forth out of
  the garden of Delight to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he cast out Adam and caused him
  to dwell over against the garden of Delight, and stationed the cherubs and
  the fiery sword that turns about to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she
  conceived and brought forth Cain and said, I have gained a man through God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And she again bore his brother Abel.
  And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it was so after some time that
  Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Abel also brought of the firstborn of his
  sheep and of his fatlings, and God looked upon Abel and his gifts,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> but Cain and his sacrifices he
  regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord God said to Cain, Why art
  thou become very sorrowful and why is thy countenance fallen? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Hast thou not sinned if thou hast brought it
  rightly, but not rightly divided it? be still, to thee shall be his
  submission, and thou shalt rule over him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go out
  into the plain; and it came to pass that when they were in the plain Cain
  rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord God said to Cain, Where is Abel thy
  brother? and he said, I know not, am I my brother’s keeper? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord said, What hast thou done? the voice
  of thy brother’s blood cries to me out of the ground. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And now thou art cursed from the earth which has
  opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When thou tillest the earth, then it shall not
  continue to give its strength to thee: thou shalt be groaning and trembling
  on the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Cain said to the
  Lord God, My crime is too great for me to be forgiven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> If thou castest me out this day from the face of
  the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy presence, and I shall be groaning
  and trembling upon the earth, then it will be that any one that finds me
  shall slay me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord God said
  to him, Not so, any one that slays Cain shall suffer seven-fold vengeance;
  and the Lord God set a mark upon Cain that no one that found him might slay
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> So Cain went forth from the
  presence of God and dwelt in the land of Nod over against Edem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Cain knew his wife, and having conceived she
  bore Enoch; and he built a city; and he named the city after the name of his
  son, Enoch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And to Enoch was born
  Gaidad; and Gaidad begot Maleleel; and Maleleel begot Mathusala; and
  Mathusala begot Lamech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Lamech
  took to himself two wives; the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the
  second Sella. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Ada bore Jobel; he
  was the father of those that dwell in tents, feeding cattle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the name of his brother was Jubal; he it was
  who invented the psaltery and harp. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And Sella also bore Thobel; he was a smith, a manufacturer both of brass and
  iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noëma. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella, Hear
  my voice, ye wives of Lamech, consider my words, because I have slain a man
  to my sorrow and a youth to my grief. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Because vengeance has been exacted seven times on Cain’s behalf, on Lamech’s
  it shall be seventy times seven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore a son, and called his name
  Seth, saying, For God has raised up to me another seed instead of Abel, whom
  Cain slew. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Seth had a son, and he
  called his name Enos: he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> This is the genealogy of men in the
  day in which God made Adam; in the image of God he made him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> male and female he made them, and blessed them;
  and he called his name Adam, in the day in which he made them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years, and
  begot a son after his own form, and after his own image, and he called his
  name Seth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the days of Adam, which
  he lived after his begetting Seth, were seven hundred years; and he begot
  sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And all the days
  of Adam which he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now Seth lived two hundred and five
  years, and begot Enos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Seth lived
  after his begetting Enos, seven hundred and seven years, and he begot sons
  and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And all the days of
  Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Enos lived an hundred and ninety years, and
  begot Cainan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Enos lived after
  his begetting Cainan, seven hundred and fifteen years, and he begot sons and
  daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all the days of Enos
  were nine hundred and five years, and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Cainan lived an hundred and seventy years,
  and he begot Maleleel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Cainan
  lived after his begetting Maleleel, seven hundred and forty years, and he
  begot sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And all the
  days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Maleleel lived an hundred and sixty and five
  years, and he begot Jared. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  Maleleel lived after his begetting Jared, seven hundred and thirty years, and
  he begot sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And all
  the days of Maleleel were eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he
  died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jared lived an hundred and
  sixty and two years, and begot Enoch: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  and Jared lived after his begetting Enoch, eight hundred years, and he begot
  sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And all the days
  of Jared were nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Enoch lived an hundred and sixty and five
  years, and begat Mathusala. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Enoch
  was well-pleasing to God after his begetting Mathusala, two hundred years,
  and he begot sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty and five years.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Enoch was well-pleasing to God,
  and was not found, because God translated him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Mathusala lived an hundred and sixty and
  seven years, and begot Lamech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  Mathusala lived after his begetting Lamech eight hundred and two years, and
  begot sons and daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And all the
  days of Mathusala which he lived, were nine hundred and sixty and nine years,
  and he died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Lamech lived an
  hundred and eighty and eight years, and begot a son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he called his name Noe, saying, This one will
  cause us to cease from our works, and from the toils of our hands, and from
  the earth, which the Lord God has cursed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Lamech lived after his begetting Noe, five
  hundred and sixty and five years, and begot sons and daughters. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and
  fifty-three years, and he died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  Noe was five hundred years old, and he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and
  Japheth.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass when men began
  to be numerous upon the earth, and daughters were born to them, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> that the sons of God having seen the daughters of
  men that they were beautiful, took to themselves wives of all whom they
  chose. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord God said, My
  Spirit shall certainly not remain among these men for ever, because they are
  flesh, but their days shall be an hundred and twenty years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Now the giants were upon the earth in those days;
  and after that when the sons of God were wont to go in to the daughters of
  men, they bore children to them, those were the giants of old, the men of
  renown. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord God having seen
  that the wicked actions of men were multiplied upon the earth, and that every
  one in his heart was intently brooding over evil continually, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> then God laid it to heart that he had made man
  upon the earth, and he pondered it deeply. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And God said, I will blot out man whom I have made
  from the face of the earth, even man with cattle, and reptiles with flying
  creatures of the sky, for I am grieved that I have made them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But Noe found grace before the Lord God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And these are the generations of Noe.
  Noe was a just man; being perfect in his generation, Noe was well-pleasing to
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Noe begot three sons, Sem,
  Cham, Japheth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the earth was
  corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with iniquity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord God saw the earth, and it was
  corrupted; because all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord God said to Noe, A
  period of all men is come before me; because the earth has been filled with
  iniquity by them, and, behold, I destroy them and the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Make therefore for thyself an ark of square
  timber; thou shalt make the ark in compartments, and thou shalt pitch it
  within and without with pitch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And
  thus shalt thou make the ark; three hundred cubits the length of the ark, and
  fifty cubits the breadth, and thirty cubits the height of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thou shalt narrow the ark in making it, and in a
  cubit above thou shalt finish it, and the door of the ark thou shalt make on
  the side; with lower, second, and third stories thou shalt make it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And behold I bring a flood of water
  upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under
  heaven, and whatsoever things are upon the earth shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I will establish my covenant with thee, and
  thou shalt enter into the ark, and thy sons and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives
  with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And of all cattle and of
  all reptiles and of all wild beasts, even of all flesh, thou shalt bring by
  pairs of all, into the ark, that thou mayest feed them with thyself: male and
  female they shall be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Of all winged
  birds after their kind, and of all cattle after their kind, and of all
  reptiles creeping upon the earth after their kind, pairs of all shall come in
  to thee, male and female to be fed with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And thou shalt take to thyself of all kinds of
  food which ye eat, and thou shalt gather them to thyself, and it shall be for
  thee and them to eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Noe did all
  things whatever the Lord God commanded him, so did he.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord God said to Noe, Enter
  thou and all thy family into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before
  me in this generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And of the
  clean cattle take in to thee sevens, male and female, and of the unclean
  cattle pairs male and female. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And of
  clean flying creatures of the sky sevens, male and female, and of all unclean
  flying creatures pairs, male and female, to maintain seed on all the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For yet seven days having passed I
  bring rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out
  every offspring which I have made from the face of all the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Noe did all things whatever the
  Lord God commanded him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Noe was
  six hundred years old when the flood of water was upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And then went in Noe and his sons and
  his wife, and his sons’ wives with him into the ark, because of the water of
  the flood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And of clean flying
  creatures and of unclean flying creatures, and of clean cattle and of unclean
  cattle, and of all things that creep upon the earth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> pairs went in to Noe into the ark, male and
  female, as God commanded Noe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it
  came to pass after the seven days that the water of the flood came upon the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> In the six hundredth year of
  the life of Noe, in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
  on this day all the fountains of the abyss were broken up, and the
  flood-gates of heaven were opened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> On that very day entered Noe, Sem, Cham, Japheth,
  the sons of Noe, and the wife of Noe, and the three wives of his sons with
  him into the ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And all the wild
  beasts after their kind, and all cattle after their kind, and every reptile
  moving itself on the earth after its kind, and every flying bird after its
  kind, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> went in to Noe into the ark,
  pairs, male and female of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they that entered went in male
  and female of all flesh, as God commanded Noe, and the Lord God shut the ark
  outside of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the flood was
  upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and the water abounded greatly
  and bore up the ark, and it was lifted on high from off the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the water prevailed and abounded
  exceedingly upon the earth, and the ark was borne upon the water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the water prevailed exceedingly
  upon the earth, and covered all the high mountains which were under heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Fifteen cubits upwards was the water
  raised, and it covered all the high mountains <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And there died all flesh that moved upon the
  earth, of flying creatures and cattle, and of wild beasts, and every reptile
  moving upon the earth, and every man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And all things which have the breath of life, and whatever was on the dry
  land, died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And God blotted out every
  offspring which was upon the face of the earth, both man and beast, and
  reptiles, and birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth, and
  Noe was left alone, and those with him in the ark. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the water was raised over the earth an
  hundred and fifty days.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And God remembered Noe, and all the
  wild beasts, and all the cattle, and all the birds, and all the reptiles that
  creep, as many as were with him in the ark, and God brought a wind upon the
  earth, and the water stayed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the
  fountains of the deep were closed up, and the flood-gates of heaven, and the
  rain from heaven was withheld. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the
  water subsided, and went off the earth, and after an hundred and fifty days
  the water was diminished, and the ark rested in the seventh month, on the
  twenty-seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the water continued to decrease until the
  tenth month. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And in the tenth month,
  on the first day of the month, the heads of the mountains were seen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it came to pass after forty days
  Noe opened the window of the ark which he had made. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he sent forth a raven; and it went forth and
  returned not until the water was dried from off the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he sent a dove after it to see if the water
  had ceased from off the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the
  dove not having found rest for her feet, returned to him into the ark,
  because the water was on all the face of the earth, and he stretched out his
  hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And having waited yet seven other days, be again
  sent forth the dove from the ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  the dove returned to him in the evening, and had a leaf of olive, a sprig in
  her mouth; and Noe knew that the water had ceased from off the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And having waited yet seven other
  days, he again sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him again any
  more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came to pass in the six
  hundred and first year of the life of Noe, in the first month, on the first
  day of the month, the water subsided from off the earth, and Noe opened the
  covering of the ark which he had made, and he saw that the water had subsided
  from the face of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And in
  the second month the earth was dried, on the twenty-seventh day of the month.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord God spoke to Noe,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Come out from the ark, thou
  and thy wife and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And all the wild beasts as many as are with thee,
  and all flesh both of birds and beasts, and every reptile moving upon the
  earth, bring forth with thee, and increase ye and multiply upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Noe came forth, and his wife and
  his sons, and his sons’ wives with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And all the wild beasts and all the cattle and
  every bird, and every reptile creeping upon the earth after their kind, came
  forth out of the ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Noe built
  an altar to the Lord, and took of all clean beasts, and of all clean birds,
  and offered a whole burnt-offering upon the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord God smelled a smell of sweetness,
  and the Lord God having considered, said, I will not any more curse the
  earth, because of the works of men, because the imagination of man is
  intently bent upon evil things from his youth, I will not therefore any more
  smite all living flesh as I have done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> All the days of the earth, seed and harvest, cold
  and heat, summer and spring, shall not cease by day or night.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And God blessed Noe and his sons,
  and said to them, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth and have dominion
  over it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the dread and the fear of
  you shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth, on all the birds of the
  sky, and on all things moving upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
  sea, I have placed them under your power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And every reptile which is living shall be to you
  for meat, I have given all things to you as the green herbs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But flesh with blood of life ye shall not eat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For your blood of your lives will I
  require at the hand of all wild beasts, and I will require the life of man at
  the hand of his brother man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He that
  sheds man’s blood, instead of that blood shall his own be shed, for in the
  image of God I made man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But do ye
  increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have dominion over it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And God spoke to Noe, and to his sons
  with him, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And behold I
  establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and with every living creature with you, of birds
  and of beasts, and with all the wild beasts of the earth, as many as are with
  you, of all that come out of the ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall not any more
  die by the water of the flood, and there shall no more be a flood of water to
  destroy all the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord
  God said to Noe, This is the sign of the covenant which I set between me and
  you, and between every living creature which is with you for perpetual
  generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I set my bow in the
  cloud, and it shall be for a sign of covenant between me and the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And it shall be when I gather clouds
  upon the earth, that my bow shall be seen in the cloud. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I will remember my covenant, which is between
  me and you, and between every living soul in all flesh, and there shall no
  longer be water for a deluge, so as to blot out all flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And my bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look
  to remember the everlasting covenant between me and the earth, and between
  every living soul in all flesh, which is upon the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And God said to Noe, This is the sign of the
  covenant, which I have made between me and all flesh, which is upon the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Now the sons of Noe which came
  out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, Japheth. And Cham was father of Chanaan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> These three are the sons of Noe, of
  these were men scattered over all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Noe began to be a husbandman, and he planted
  a vineyard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he drank of the wine,
  and was drunk, and was naked in his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Cham the father of Chanaan saw the nakedness
  of his father, and he went out and told his two brothers without.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Sem and Japheth having taken a
  garment, put it on both their backs and went backwards, and covered the
  nakedness of their father; and their face was backward, and they saw not the
  nakedness of their father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Noe
  recovered from the wine, and knew all that his younger son had done to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he said, Cursed be the servant
  Chanaan, a slave shall he be to his brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, and
  Chanaan shall be his bond-servant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  May God make room for Japheth, and let him dwell in the habitations of Sem,
  and let Chanaan be his servant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And all the days of Noe were nine hundred and
  fifty years, and he died.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now these are the generations of
  the sons of Noe, Sem, Cham, Japheth; and sons were born to them after the
  flood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The sons of Japheth, Gamer, and
  Magog, and Madoi, and Jovan, and Elisa, and Thobel, and Mosoch, and Thiras.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the sons of Gamer, Aschanaz, and
  Riphath, and Thorgama. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the sons of
  Jovan, Elisa, and Tharseis, Cetians, Rhodians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> From these were the islands of the Gentiles
  divided in their land, each according to his tongue, in their tribes and in
  their nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the sons of Cham,
  Chus, and Mesrain, Phud, and Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And the sons of Chus, Saba, and Evila, and Sabatha, and Rhegma, and
  Sabathaca. And the sons of Rhegma, Saba, and Dadan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Chus begot Nebrod: he began to be a giant upon
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He was a giant hunter
  before the Lord God; therefore they say, As Nebrod the giant hunter before
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the beginning of his
  kingdom was Babylon, and Orech, and Archad, and Chalanne, in the land of
  Senaar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Out of that land came Assur,
  and built Ninevi, and the city Rhooboth, and Chalach, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and Dase between Ninevi and Chalach: this is the
  great city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Mesrain begot the
  Ludiim, and the Nephthalim, and the Enemetiim, and the Labiim, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and the Patrosoniim, and the Chasmoniim (whence
  came forth Phylistiim) and the Gaphthoriim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Chanaan begot Sidon his first-born, and the
  Chettite, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and the Jebusite, and the
  Amorite, and the Girgashite, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and the
  Evite, and the Arukite, and the Asennite, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and the Aradian, and the Samarean, and the
  Amathite; and after this the tribes of the Chananites were dispersed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the boundaries of the Chananites
  were from Sidon till one comes to Gerara and Gaza, till one comes to Sodom
  and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, as far as Dasa. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> These were the sons of Cham in their tribes
  according to their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And to Sem himself also were children
  born, the father of all the sons of Heber, the brother of Japheth the elder.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Sons of Sem, Elam, and Assur, and
  Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram, and Cainan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And sons of Aram, Uz, and Ul, and Gater, and
  Mosoch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Arphaxad begot Cainan,
  and Cainan begot Sala. And Sala begot Heber. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And to Heber were born two sons, the name of the
  one, Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his
  brother Jektan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Jektan begot
  Elmodad, and Saleth, and Sarmoth, and Jarach, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and Odorrha, and Aibel, and Decla, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and Eval, and Abimael, and Saba, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and Uphir, and Evila, and Jobab, all these were
  the sons of Jektan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And their
  dwelling was from Masse, till one comes to Saphera, a mountain of the east.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> These were the sons of Sem in their
  tribes, according to their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> These are the tribes of the sons of
  Noe, according to their generations, according to their nations: of them were
  the islands of the Gentiles scattered over the earth after the flood.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And all the earth was one lip, and
  there was one language to all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it
  came to pass as they moved from the east, they found a plain in the land of
  Senaar, and they dwelt there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And a
  man said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks and bake them with fire.
  And the brick was to them for stone, and their mortar was bitumen.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they said, Come, let us build to
  ourselves a city and tower, whose top shall be to heaven, and let us make to
  ourselves a name, before we are scattered abroad upon the face of all the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord came down to see
  the city and the tower, which the sons of men built. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord said, Behold, there is one race, and
  one lip of all, and they have begun to do this, and now nothing shall fail
  from them of all that they may have undertaken to do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Come, and having gone down let us there confound
  their tongue, that they may not understand each the voice of his neighbour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord scattered them thence
  over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city and the
  tower. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> On this account its name was
  called Confusion, because there the Lord confounded the languages of all the
  earth, and thence the Lord scattered them upon the face of all the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And these are the generations of Sem:
  and Sem was a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad, the second year after
  the flood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Sem lived, after he
  had begotten Arphaxad, five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters, and
  died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Arphaxad lived a hundred
  and thirty-five years, and begot Cainan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Cainan,
  four hundred years, and begot sons and daughters, and died. And Cainan lived
  a hundred and thirty years and begot Sala; and Canaan lived after he had
  begotten Sala, three hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters,
  and died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Sala lived an hundred
  and thirty years, and begot Heber. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And Sala lived after he had begotten Heber, three hundred and thirty years,
  and begot sons and daughters, and died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Heber lived an hundred and thirty-four years,
  and begot Phaleg. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Heber lived
  after he had begotten Phaleg two hundred and seventy years, and begot sons
  and daughters, and died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Phaleg
  lived an hundred and thirty years, and begot Ragau. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Phaleg lived after he had begotten Ragau, two
  hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters, and died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Ragau lived an hundred thirty and two years,
  and begot Seruch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Ragau lived
  after he had begotten Seruch, two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and
  daughters, and died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Seruch lived
  a hundred and thirty years, and begot Nachor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Seruch lived after he had begotten Nachor,
  two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters, and died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Nachor lived a hundred and seventy-nine
  years, and begot Tharrha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Nachor
  lived after he had begotten Tharrha, an hundred and twenty-five years, and
  begot sons and daughters, and he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Tharrha lived seventy years, and begot Abram,
  and Nachor, and Arrhan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And these are
  the generations of Tharrha. Tharrha begot Abram and Nachor, and Arrhan; and
  Arrhan begot Lot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Arrhan died in
  the presence of Tharrha his father, in the land in which he was born, in the
  country of the Chaldees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Abram
  and Nachor took to themselves wives, the name of the wife of Abram was Sara,
  and the name of the wife of Nachor, Malcha, daughter of Arrhan, and he was
  the father of Malcha, the father of Jescha. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Sara was barren, and did not bear children.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Tharrha took Abram his son, and
  Lot the son of Arrhan, the son of his son, and Sara his daughter-in-law, the
  wife of Abram his son, and led them forth out of the land of the Chaldees, to
  go into the land of Chanaan, and they came as far as Charrhan, and he dwelt
  there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And all the days of Tharrha in
  the land of Charrhan were two hundred and five years, and Tharrha died in
  Charrhan.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord said to Abram, Go
  forth out of thy land and out of thy kindred, and out of the house of thy
  father, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I will make thee a great nation, and I will
  bless thee and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I will bless those that bless thee, and curse
  those that curse thee, and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be
  blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Abram went as the Lord
  spoke to him, and Lot departed with him, and Abram was seventy-five years
  old, when he went out of Charrhan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  Abram took Sara his wife, and Lot the son of his brother, and all their
  possessions, as many as they had got, and every soul which they had got in
  Charrhan, and they went forth to go into the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abram traversed the land lengthwise as far as
  the place Sychem, to the high oak, and the Chananites then inhabited the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord appeared to Abram,
  and said to him, I will give this land to thy seed. And Abram built an altar
  there to the Lord, who appeared to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he departed thence to the mountain eastward of
  Bæthel, and there he pitched his tent in Bæthel near the sea, and Aggai
  toward the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord, and called on the
  name of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Abram departed
  and went and encamped in the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there was a famine in the land, and Abram
  went down to Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine prevailed in the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it came to pass when Abram
  drew nigh to enter into Egypt, Abram said to Sara his wife, I know that thou
  art a fair woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> It shall come to
  pass then that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they shall say, This is his
  wife, and they shall slay me, but they shall save thee alive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Say, therefore, I am his sister, that it may be
  well with me on account of thee, and my soul shall live because of thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And it came to pass when Abram
  entered into Egypt—the Egyptians having seen his wife that she was very
  beautiful— <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> that the princes of Pharao
  saw her, and praised her to Pharao and brought her into the house of Pharao.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they treated Abram well on her
  account, and he had sheep, and calves, and asses, and men-servants, and
  women-servants, and mules, and camels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And God afflicted Pharao with great and severe
  afflictions, and his house, because of Sara, Abram’s wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Pharao having called Abram, said, What is
  this thou hast done to me, that thou didst not tell me that she was thy wife?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Wherefore didst thou say, She is my
  sister? and I took her for a wife to myself; and now, behold, thy wife is
  before thee, take her and go quickly away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Pharao gave charge to men concerning Abram,
  to join in sending him forward, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he
  and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the wilderness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Abram was very rich in cattle, and
  silver, and gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he went to the
  place whence he came, into the wilderness as far as Bæthel, as far as the
  place where his tent was before, between Bæthel and Aggai, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> to the place of the altar, which he built there at
  first, and Abram there called on the name of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Lot who went out with Abram had sheep, and
  oxen, and tents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the land was not
  large enough for them to live together, because their possessions were great;
  and the land was not large enough for them to live together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And there was a strife between the herdmen of
  Abram’s cattle, and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle, and the Chananites and the
  Pherezites then inhabited the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And Abram said to Lot, Let there not be a strife between me and thee, and
  between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we are brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Lo! is not the whole land before thee? Separate
  thyself from me; if thou goest to the left, I will go to the right, and if
  thou goest to the right, I will go to the left. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Lot having lifted up his eyes, observed all
  the country round about Jordan, that it was all watered, before God overthrew
  Sodom and Gomorrha, as the garden of the Lord, and as the land of Egypt,
  until thou come to Zogora. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Lot
  chose for himself all the country round Jordan, and Lot went from the east,
  and they were separated each from his brother. And Abram dwelt in the land of
  Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Lot dwelt in a city of
  the neighbouring people, and pitched his tent in Sodom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the men of Sodom were evil, and exceedingly
  sinful before God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And God said to
  Abram after Lot was separated from him, Look up with thine eyes, and behold
  from the place where thou now art northward and southward, and eastward and
  seaward; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for all the land which thou
  seest, I will give it to thee and to thy seed for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will make thy seed like the dust of the
  earth; if any one is able to number the dust of the earth, then shall thy
  seed be numbered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Arise and traverse
  the land, both in the length of it and in the breadth; for to thee will I
  give it, and to thy seed for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And Abram having removed his tent, came and dwelt by the oak of Mambre, which
  was in Chebrom, and he there built an altar to the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass in the reign of
  Amarphal king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, that Chodollogomor king
  of Elam, and Thargal king of nations, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  made war with Balla king of Sodom, and with Barsa king of Gomorrha, and with
  Sennaar, king of Adama, and with Symobor king of Seboim and the king of
  Balac, this is Segor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> All these met
  with one consent at the salt valley; this is now the sea of salt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Twelve years they served
  Chodollogomor, and the thirteenth year they revolted.<span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And in the fourteenth year came Chodollogomor, and
  the kings with him, and cut to pieces the giants in Astaroth, and Carnain,
  and strong nations with them, and the Ommæans in the city Save. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Chorrhæans in the mountains of Seir, to
  the turpentine tree of Pharan, which is in the desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And having turned back they came to the well of
  judgment; this is Cades, and they cut in pieces all the princes of Amalec,
  and the Amorites dwelling in Asasonthamar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the king of Sodom went out, and the king of
  Gomorrha, and king of Adama, and king of Seboim, and king of Balac, this is
  Segor, and they set themselves in array against them for war in the salt
  valley, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> against Chodollogomor king of
  Elam, and Thargal king of nations, and Amarphal king of Sennaar, and Arioch
  king of Ellasar, the four kings against the five. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now the salt valley consists of slime-pits. And
  the king of Sodom fled and the king of Gomorrha, and they fell in there: and
  they that were left fled to the mountain country. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they took all the cavalry of Sodom and
  Gomorrha, and all their provisions, and departed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they took also Lot the son of Abram’s
  brother, and his baggage, and departed, for he dwelt in Sodom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And one of them that had been rescued came and
  told Abram the Hebrew; and he dwelt by the oak of Mamre the Amorite the
  brother of Eschol, and the brother of Aunan, who were confederates with
  Abram. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Abram having heard that
  Lot his nephew had been taken captive, numbered his own home-born servants
  three hundred and eighteen, and pursued after them to Dan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he came upon them by night, he and his
  servants, and he smote them and pursued them as far as Choba, which is on the
  left of Damascus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he recovered
  all the cavalry of Sodom, and he recovered Lot his nephew, and all his
  possessions, and the women and the people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after
  he returned from the slaughter of Chodollogomor, and the kings with him, to
  the valley of Saby, this was the plain of the kings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth
  loaves and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he blessed Abram, and said, Blessed be Abram
  of the most high God, who made heaven and earth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and blessed be the most high God who delivered
  thine enemies into thy power. And Abram gave him the tithe of all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the king of Sodom said to Abram,
  Give me the men, and take the horses to thyself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I will
  stretch out my hand to the Lord the most high God, who made the heaven and
  the earth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that I will not take from
  all thy goods from a string to a shoe-latchet, lest thou shouldest say, I
  have made Abram rich. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Except what
  things the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with
  me, Eschol, Aunan, Mambre, these shall take a portion.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after these things the word of
  the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I shield thee,
  thy reward shall be very great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  Abram said, Master and Lord, what wilt thou give me? whereas I am departing
  without a child, but the son of Masek my home-born female slave, this Eliezer
  of Damascus is mine heir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Abram
  said, I am grieved since thou hast given me no seed, but my home-born servant
  shall succeed me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And immediately
  there was a voice of the Lord to him, saying, This shall not be thine heir;
  but he that shall come out of thee shall be thine heir. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he brought him out and said to him, Look up
  now to heaven, and count the stars, if thou shalt be able to number them
  fully, and he said, Thus shall thy seed be. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him
  for righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to him,
  I am God that brought thee out of the land of the Chaldeans, so as to give
  thee this land to inherit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he
  said, Master and Lord, how shall I know that I shall inherit it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to him, Take for me an heifer in her
  third year, and a she-goat in her third year, and a ram in his third year,
  and a dove and a pigeon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> So he took
  to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and set them opposite to
  each other, but the birds he did not divide. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And birds came down upon the bodies, even upon
  the divided parts of them, and Abram sat down by them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And about sunset a trance fell upon Abram, and
  lo! a great gloomy terror falls upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it was said to Abram, Thou shalt surely know
  that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land not their own, and they shall
  enslave them, and afflict them, and humble them four hundred years.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the nation whomsoever they shall
  serve I will judge; and after this, they shall come forth hither with much
  property. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But thou shalt depart to
  thy fathers in peace, nourished in a good old age. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And in the fourth generation they shall return
  hither, for the sins of the Amorites are not yet filled up, even until now.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And when the sun was about to set,
  there was a flame, and behold a smoking furnace and lamps of fire, which
  passed between these divided pieces. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed I will
  give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The Kenites, and the Kenezites, and
  the Kedmoneans, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and the Chettites,
  and the Pherezites, and the Raphaim, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  and the Amorites, and the Chananites, and the Evites, and the Gergesites, and
  the Jebusites.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Sara the wife of Abram bore him
  no children, and she had an Egyptian maid, whose name was Agar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Sara said to Abram, Behold, the Lord has
  restrained me from bearing, go therefore in to my maid, that I may get
  children for myself through her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sara.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So Sara the wife of Abram having taken
  Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land
  of Chanaan, gave her to Abram her husband as a wife to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he went in to Agar, and she conceived, and saw
  that she was with child, and her mistress was dishonoured before her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Sara said to Abram, I am injured
  by thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and when I saw that she was with
  child, I was dishonoured before her. The Lord judge between me and thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abram said to Sara, Behold thy
  handmaid is in thy hands, use her as it may seem good to thee. And Sara
  afflicted her, and she fled from her face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And an angel of the Lord found her by the fountain
  of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Sur. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to her, Agar, Sara’
  s maid, whence comest thou, and whither goest thou? and she said, I am
  fleeing from the face of my mistress Sara. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to her, Return to
  thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to her, I will
  surely multiply thy seed, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the angel of the Lord said to
  her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his
  name Ismael, for the Lord hath hearkened to thy humiliation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He shall be a wild man, his hands against all,
  and the hands of all against him, and he shall dwell in the presence of all
  his brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And she called the name
  of the Lord God who spoke to her, Thou art God who seest me; for she said,
  For I have openly seen him that appeared to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore she called the well, The well of him
  whom I have openly seen; behold it is between Cades and Barad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Agar bore a son to Abram; and Abram called
  the name of his son which Agar bore to him, Ismael. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Abram was eighty-six years old, when Agar
  bore Ismael to Abram.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abram was ninety-nine years
  old, and the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, I am thy God, be
  well-pleasing before me, and be blameless. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I will establish my covenant between me and
  thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Abram fell upon his face, and God spoke to
  him, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I, behold! my
  covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And thy name shall no more be called
  Abram, but thy name shall be Abraam, for I have made thee a father of many
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will increase thee very
  exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I will establish my covenant
  between thee and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for an
  everlasting covenant, to be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I will give to thee and to thy
  seed after thee the land wherein thou sojournest, even all the land of
  Chanaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be to them a God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God said to Abraam, Thou also
  shalt fully keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee for their
  generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And this is the covenant
  which thou shalt fully keep between me and you, and between thy seed after
  thee for their generations; every male of you shall be circumcised.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And ye shall be circumcised in the
  flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me
  and you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the child of eight days
  old shall be circumcised by you, every male throughout your generations, and
  the servant born in the house and he that is bought with money, of every son
  of a stranger, who is not of thy seed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He that is born in thy house, and he that is
  bought with money shall be surely circumcised, and my covenant shall be on
  your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the uncircumcised male, who shall not be
  circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall
  be utterly destroyed from its family, for he has broken my covenant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And God said to Abraam, Sara thy wife—
   her name shall not be called Sara, Sarrha shall be her name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will bless her, and give thee a son of her,
  and I will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of nations shall
  be of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Abraam fell upon his
  face, and laughed; and spoke in his heart, saying, Shall there be a child to
  one who is a hundred years old, and shall Sarrha who is ninety years old,
  bear? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Abraam said to God, Let
  this Ismael live before thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And God
  said to Abraam, Yea, behold, Sarrha thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou
  shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an
  everlasting covenant, to be a God to him and to his seed after him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And concerning Ismael, behold, I have
  heard thee, and, behold, I have blessed him, and will increase him and
  multiply him exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him
  a great nation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But I will establish
  my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarrha shall bear to thee at this time, in the
  next year. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he left off speaking
  with him, and God went up from Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Abraam took Ismael his son, and all his
  home-born servants, and all those bought with money, and every male of the
  men in the house of Abraam, and he circumcised their foreskins in the time of
  that day, according as God spoke to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Abraam was ninety-nine years old, when he was
  circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Ismael his son was thirteen years old when he
  was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And at the period of that day, Abraam was
  circumcised, and Ismael his son, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and
  all the men of his house, both those born in the house, and those bought with
  money of foreign nations.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And God appeared to him by the oak

  three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the

  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abraam hasted to the tent to Sarrha, and said
  to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Abraam ran to the kine, and took a
  young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hasted to
  dress it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he took butter and milk,
  and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did
  eat, and he stood by them under the tree. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to him, Where is Sarrha thy wife? And
  he answered and said, Behold! in the tent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he said, I will return and come to thee
  according to this period seasonably, and Sarrha thy wife shall have a son;
  and Sarrha heard at the door of the tent, being behind him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Abraam and Sarrha were old, advanced in days,
  and the custom of women ceased with Sarrha. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Sarrha laughed in herself, saying, The thing
  has not as yet happened to me, even until now, and my lord is old.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord said to Abraam, Why is
  it that Sarrha has laughed in herself, saying, Shall I then indeed bear? but
  I am grown old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Shall anything be
  impossible with the Lord? At this time I will return to thee seasonably, and
  Sarrha shall have a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But Sarrha
  denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said to her, Nay,
  but thou didst laugh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the men
  having risen up from thence looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha. And Abraam
  went with them, attending them on their journey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraam my
  servant what things I intend to do? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  But Abraam shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the
  nations of the earth be blest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For I
  know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep
  the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring
  upon Abraam all things whatsoever he has spoken to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha
  has been increased towards me, and their sins are very great. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I will therefore go down and see, if they
  completely correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may
  know. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the men having departed
  thence, came to Sodom; And Abraam was still standing before the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Abraam drew nigh and said,
  Wouldest thou destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous
  be as the wicked? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Should there be
  fifty righteous in the city, wilt thou destroy them? wilt thou not spare the
  whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> By no means shalt thou do as this
  thing is so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous
  shall be as the wicked: by no means. Thou that judgest the whole earth, shalt
  thou not do right? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the Lord said,
  If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the
  whole city, and the whole place for their sakes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Abraam answered and said, Now I have begun to
  speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if the fifty righteous should be diminished
  to forty-five, wilt thou destroy the whole city because of the five wanting?
  And he said I, will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he continued to speak to him
  still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I
  will not destroy it for the forty’s sake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he said, Will there be anything against me,
  Lord, if I shall speak? but if there be found there thirty? And he said, I
  will not destroy it for the thirty’s sake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said, Since I am able to speak to the
  Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not
  destroy it, if I should find there twenty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he said, Will there be anything against me,
  Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he
  said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking
  to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the two angels came to Sodom at
  evening. And Lot sat by the gate of Sodom, and Lot having seen them, rose up
  to meet them, and he worshipped with his face to the ground, and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Lo! my lords, turn aside to the house
  of your servant, and rest from your journey, and wash your feet, and having
  risen early in the morning ye shall depart on your journey. And they said,
  Nay, but we will lodge in the street. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And he constrained them, and they turned aside to him, and they entered into
  his house, and he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened cakes for them,
  and they did eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But before they went
  to sleep, the men of the city, the Sodomites, compassed the house, both young
  and old, all the people together. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  they called out Lot, and they said to him, Where are the men that went in to
  thee this night? bring them out to us that we may be with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Lot went out to them to the porch, and he shut
  the door after him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and said to them,
  By no means, brethren, do not act villanously. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I have two daughters, who have not known a
  man. I will bring them out to you, and do ye use them as it may please you,
  only do not injury to these men, to avoid which they came under the shelter
  of my roof. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they said to him,
  Stand back there, thou camest in to sojourn, was it also to judge? Now then
  we would harm thee more than them. And they pressed hard on the man, even
  Lot, and they drew nigh to break the door. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the men stretched forth their hands and drew
  Lot in to them into the house, and shut the door of the house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they smote the men that were at the door of
  the house with blindness, both small and great, and they were wearied with
  seeking the door. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the men said to
  Lot, Hast thou here sons-in-law, or sons or daughters, or if thou hast any
  other friend in the city, bring them out of this place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For we are going to destroy this place; for their
  cry has been raised up before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Lot went out, and spoke to
  his sons-in-law who had married his daughters, and said, Rise up, and depart
  out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city; but he seemed
  to be speaking absurdly before his sons-in-law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But when it was morning, the angels hastened Lot,
  saying, Arise and take thy wife, and thy two daughters whom thou hast, and go
  forth; lest thou also be destroyed with the iniquities of the city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they were troubled, and the
  angels laid hold on his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his
  two daughters, in that the Lord spared him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to pass when they brought them out,
  that they said, Save thine own life by all means; look not round to that
  which is behind, nor stay in all the country round about, escape to the
  mountain, lest perhaps thou be overtaken together with them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Lot said to them, I pray, Lord, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> since thy servant has found mercy before thee,
  and thou hast magnified thy righteousness, in what thou doest towards me that
  my soul may live,—but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest
  perhaps the calamity overtake me and I die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Behold this city is near for me to escape
  thither, which is a small one, and there shall I be preserved, is it not
  little? and my soul shall live because of thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he said to him, Behold, I have had respect to
  thee also about this thing, that I should not overthrow the city about which
  thou hast spoken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Hasten therefore to
  escape thither, for I shall not be able to do anything until thou art come
  thither; therefore he called the name of that city, Segor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot
  entered into Segor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Lord
  rained on Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he overthrew these cities, and
  all the country round about, and all that dwelt in the cities, and the plants
  springing out of the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And his
  wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Abraam rose up early to go to the place,
  where he had stood before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and towards the surrounding
  country, and saw, and behold a flame went up from the earth, as the smoke of
  a furnace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And it came to pass that
  when God destroyed all the cities of the region round about, God remembered
  Abraam, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when the Lord
  overthrew those cities in which Lot dwelt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Lot went up out of Segor; and dwelt in the
  mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Segor,
  and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the elder said to the younger, Our father is
  old, and there is no one on the earth who shall come in to us, as it is fit
  in all the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Come and let us
  make our father drink wine, and let us sleep with him, and let us raise up
  seed from our father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> So they made
  their father drink wine in that night, and the elder went in and lay with her
  father that night, and he knew not when he slept and when he rose up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And it came to pass on the morrow,
  that the elder said to the younger, Behold, I slept yesternight with our
  father, let us make him drink wine in this night also, and do thou go in and
  sleep with him, and let us raise up seed of our father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> So they made their father drink wine in that
  night also, and the younger went in and slept with her father, and he knew
  not when he slept, nor when he arose. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the elder bore a son, and called his name
  Moab, saying, He is of my father. This is the father of the Moabites to this
  present day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And the younger also
  bore a son, and called his name Amman, saying, the son of my family. This is
  the father of the Ammanites to this present day.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abraam removed thence to the
  southern country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Abraam said concerning Sarrha his
  wife, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any
  time the men of the city should kill him for her sake. So Abimelech king of
  Gerara sent and took Sarrha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And God
  came to Abimelech by night in sleep, and said, Behold, thou diest for the
  woman, whom thou hast taken, whereas she has lived with a husband.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Abimelech had not touched her, and
  he said, Lord, wilt thou destroy an ignorantly sinning and just nation?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Said he not to me, She is my sister,
  and said she not to me, He is my brother? with a pure heart and in the
  righteousness of my hands have I done this. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And God said to him in sleep, Yea, I knew that
  thou didst this with a pure heart, and I spared thee, so that thou shouldest
  not sin against me, therefore I suffered thee not to touch her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But now return the man his wife; for he is a
  prophet, and shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; but if thou restore
  her not, know that thou shalt die and all thine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and
  called all his servants, and he spoke all these words in their ears, and all
  the men feared exceedingly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, What is this that thou hast done to
  us? Have we sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my
  kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done to me a deed, which no one ought to do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Abimelech said to Abraam, What
  hast thou seen in me that thou hast done this? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Abraam said, Why I said, Surely there is not
  the worship of God in this place, and they will slay me because of my wife.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For truly she is my sister by my
  father, but not by my mother, and she became my wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came to pass when God brought me forth out
  of the house of my father, that I said to her, This righteousness thou shalt
  perform to me, in every place into which we may enter, say of me, He is my
  brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Abimelech took a
  thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and calves, and servants, and
  maid-servants, and gave them to Abraam, and he returned him Sarrha his wife.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Abimelech said to Abraam, Behold,
  my land is before thee, dwell wheresoever it may please thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And to Sarrha he said, Behold, I have given thy
  brother a thousand pieces of silver, those shall be to thee for the price of
  thy countenance, and to all the women with thee, and speak the truth in all
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Abraam prayed to God, and
  God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women servants, and they bore
  children. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Because the Lord had fast
  closed from without every womb in the house of Abimelech, because of Sarrha
  Abraam’s wife.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord visited Sarrha, as he
  said, and the Lord did to Sarrha, as he spoke. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And she conceived and bore to Abraam a son in old
  age, at the set time according as the Lord spoke to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Abraam called the name of his son that was
  born to him, whom Sarrha bore to him, Isaac. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Abraam circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, as
  God commanded him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Abraam was a
  hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Sarrha said, The Lord has made laughter for
  me, for whoever shall hear shall rejoice with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And she said, Who shall say to Abraam that Sarrha
  suckles a child? for I have born a child in my old age. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraam made
  a great feast the day that his son Isaac was weaned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Sarrha having seen the son of Agar the
  Egyptian who was born to Abraam, sporting with Isaac her son, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> then she said to Abraam, Cast out this bondwoman
  and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son
  Isaac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the word appeared very
  hard before Abraam concerning his son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But God said to Abraam, Let it not be hard before
  thee concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things
  whatsoever Sarrha shall say unto thee, hear her voice, for in Isaac shall thy
  seed be called. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And moreover I will
  make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Abraam rose up in the morning and
  took loaves and a skin of water, and gave them to Agar, and he put the child
  on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the
  wilderness near the well of the oath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir
  tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And she departed and sat down
  opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I
  cannot see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child
  cried aloud and wept. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And God heard
  the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God
  called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for
  God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in
  thine hand, for I will make him a great nation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
  springing water, and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the
  child drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And God was with the
  child, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he dwelt in the wilderness, and
  his mother took him a wife out of Pharan of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech
  spoke, and Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, to
  Abraam, saying, God is with thee in all things, whatsoever thou mayest do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Now therefore swear to me by God that
  thou wilt not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the
  righteousness which I have performed with thee thou shalt deal with me, and
  with the land in which thou hast sojourned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Abraam said, I will swear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Abraam reproved Abimelech because of the
  wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has
  done this thing to thee, neither didst thou tell it me, neither heard I it
  but only to-day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Abraam took
  sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Abraam set seven ewe-lambs by
  themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Abimelech said to
  Abraam, What are these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set alone?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Abraam said, Thou shalt receive
  the seven ewe-lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug
  this well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Therefore he named the
  name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they made a covenant at the well
  of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ochozath his friend, and Phichol
  the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the
  Phylistines. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Abraam planted a
  field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the
  everlasting God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Abraam sojourned
  in the land of the Phylistines many days.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis22">22</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after these
  things that God tempted Abraam, and said to him, Abraam, Abraam; and he said,
  Lo! I am here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said, Take thy
  son, the beloved one, whom thou hast loved—Isaac, and go into the high land,
  and offer him there for a whole-burnt-offering on one of the mountains which
  I will tell thee of. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Abraam rose
  up in the morning and saddled his ass, and he took with him two servants, and
  Isaac his son, and having split wood for a whole-burnt-offering, he arose and
  departed, and came to the place of which God spoke unto him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> on the third day; and Abraam having lifted up his
  eyes, saw the place afar off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  Abraam said to his servants, Sit ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will
  proceed thus far, and having worshipped we will return to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abraam took the wood of the
  whole-burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took into his
  hands both the fire and the knife, and the two went together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Isaac said to Abraam his father, Father. And
  he said, What is it, son? And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, where is
  the sheep for a whole-burnt-offering? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And Abraam said, God will provide himself a sheep for a whole-burnt-offering,
  my son. And both having gone together, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  came to the place which God spoke of to him; and there Abraam built the
  altar, and laid the wood on it, and having bound the feet of Isaac his son
  together, he laid him on the altar upon the wood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Abraam stretched forth his hand to take the
  knife to slay his son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And an angel
  of the Lord called him out of heaven, and said, Abraam, Abraam. And he said,
  Behold, I am here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said, Lay
  not thine hand upon the child, neither do anything to him, for now I know
  that thou fearest God, and for my sake thou hast not spared thy beloved son.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Abraam lifted up his eyes and
  beheld, and lo! a ram caught by his horns in a plant of Sabec; and Abraam
  went and took the ram, and offered him up for a whole-burnt-offering in the
  place of Isaac his son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Abraam
  called the name of that place, The Lord hath seen; that they might say
  to-day, In the mount the Lord was seen. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And an angel of the Lord called Abraam the second
  time out of heaven, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> saying, I have
  sworn by myself, says the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and on my
  account hast not spared thy beloved son, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> surely blessing I will bless thee, and
  multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand
  which is by the shore of the sea, and thy seed shall inherit the cities of
  their enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And in thy seed shall
  all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast hearkened to my
  voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Abraam returned to his
  servants, and they arose and went together to the well of the oath; and
  Abraam dwelt at the well of the oath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Abraam,
  saying, Behold, Melcha herself too has born sons to Nachor thy brother,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Uz the first-born, and Baux his
  brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians, and Chazad, and <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Azav and Phaldes, and Jeldaph, and Bathuel, and
  Bathuel begot Rebecca; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> these are
  eight sons, which Melcha bore to Nachor the brother of Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And his concubine whose name was Rheuma, she also
  bore Tabec, and Taam, and Tochos, and Mocha.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the life of Sarrha was an
  hundred and twenty-seven years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  Sarrha died in the city of Arboc, which is in the valley, this is Chebron in
  the land of Chanaan; and Abraam came to lament for Sarrha and to mourn.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Abraam stood up from before his
  dead; and Abraam spoke to the sons of Chet, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I am a sojourner and a stranger among you, give me
  therefore possession of a burying-place among you, and I will bury my dead
  away from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the sons of Chet
  answered to Abraam, saying, Not so, Sir, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but hear us; thou art in the midst of us a king
  from God; bury thy dead in our choice sepulchres, for not one of us will by
  any means withhold his sepulchre from thee, so that thou shouldest not bury
  thy dead there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Abraam rose up and
  did obeisance to the people of the land, to the sons of Chet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Abraam spoke to them, saying, If ye have it in
  your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hearken to me, and
  speak for me to Ephron the son of Saar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And let him give me the double cave which he has,
  which is in a part of his field, let him give it me for the money it is worth
  for possession of a burying-place among you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the
  children of Chet, and Ephron the Chettite answered Abraam and spoke in the
  hearing of the sons of Chet, and of all who entered the city, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Attend to me, my lord, and hear me, I
  give to thee the field and the cave which is in it; I have given it thee
  before all my countrymen; bury thy dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Abraam did obeisance before the people of the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said in the ears of
  Ephron before the people of the land, Since thou art on my side, hear me;
  take the price of the field from me, and I will bury my dead there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Ephron answered Abraam, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Nay, my lord, I have heard indeed,
  the land is worth four hundred silver didrachms, but what can this be between
  me and thee? nay, do thou bury thy dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Abraam hearkened to Ephron, and Abraam
  rendered to Ephron the money, which he mentioned in the ears of the sons of
  Chet, four hundred didrachms of silver approved with merchants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the field of Ephron, which was in Double
  Cave, which is opposite Mambre, the field and the cave, which was in it, and
  every tree which was in the field, and whatever is in its borders round
  about, were made sure <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> to Abraam for a
  possession, before the sons of Chet, and all that entered into the city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> After this Abraam buried Sarrha his
  wife in the Double Cave of the field, which is opposite Mambre, this is
  Chebron in the land of Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> So
  the field and the cave which was in it were made sure to Abraam for
  possession of a burying place, by the sons of Chet.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abraam was old, advanced in
  days, and the Lord blessed Abraam in all things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Abraam said to his servant the elder of his
  house, who had rule over all his possessions, Put thy hand under my thigh,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and I will adjure thee by the Lord the
  God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou take not a wife for my son
  Isaac from the daughters of the Chananites, with whom I dwell, in the midst
  of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But thou shalt go instead to
  my country, where I was born, and to my tribe, and thou shalt take from
  thence a wife for my son Isaac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  the servant said to him, Shall I carry back thy son to the land whence thou
  camest forth, if haply the woman should not be willing to return with me to
  this land? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Abraam said to him,
  Take heed to thyself that thou carry not my son back thither. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the
  earth, who took me out of my father’s house, and out of the land whence I
  sprang, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, I will give this land
  to thee and to thy seed, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt
  take a wife to my son from thence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  if the woman should not be willing to come with thee into this land, thou
  shalt be clear from my oath, only carry not my son thither again.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the servant put his hand under the
  thigh of his master Abraam, and swore to him concerning this matter.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the servant took ten camels of
  his master’s camels, and he took of all the goods of his master with him, and
  he arose and went into Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he rested his camels without the city by the
  well of water towards evening, when damsels go forth to draw water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said, O Lord God of my master
  Abraam, prosper my way before me to day, and deal mercifully with my master
  Abraam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Lo! I stand by the well of
  water, and the daughters of them that inhabit the city come forth to draw
  water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And it shall be, the virgin to
  whomsoever I shall say, Incline thy water-pot, that I may drink, and she
  shall say, Drink thou, and I will give thy camels drink, until they shall
  have done drinking—even this one thou hast prepared for thy servant Isaac,
  and hereby shall I know that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master
  Abraam. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to pass before he
  had done speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel,
  the son of Melcha, the wife of Nachor, and the same the brother of Abraam,
  came forth, having a water-pot on her shoulders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the virgin was very beautiful in appearance,
  she was a virgin, a man had not known her; and she went down to the well, and
  filled her water-pot, and came up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And the servant ran up to meet her, and said, Give me a little water to drink
  out of thy pitcher; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and she said,
  Drink, Sir; and she hasted, and let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave
  him to drink, till he ceased drinking. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And she said, I will also draw water for thy
  camels, till they shall all have drunk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And she hasted, and emptied the water-pot into
  the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the
  camels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the man took great notice
  of her, and remained silent to know whether the Lord had made his way
  prosperous or not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it came to
  pass when all the camels ceased drinking, that the man took golden ear-rings,
  each of a drachm weight, and he put two bracelets on her hands, their weight
  was of ten pieces of gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me if there is room for us
  to lodge with thy father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And she
  said to him, I am the daughter of Bathuel the son of Melcha, whom she bore to
  Nachor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And she said to him, We have
  both straw and much provender, and a place for resting. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the man being well pleased, worshipped the
  Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and said, Blessed be the Lord
  the God of my master Abraam, who has not suffered his righteousness to fail,
  nor his truth from my master, and the Lord has brought me prosperously to the
  house of the brother of my lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  the damsel ran and reported to the house of her mother according to these
  words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Rebecca had a brother
  whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to meet the man, to the well.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And it came to pass when he saw the
  earrings and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heard the
  words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went
  to the man, as he stood by the camels at the well. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he said to him, Come in hither, thou blessed
  of the Lord, why standest thou without, whereas I have prepared the house and
  a place for the camels? <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the man
  entered into the house, and unloaded the camels, and gave the camels straw
  and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were
  with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he set before them
  loaves to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And
  he said, Speak on. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he said, I am
  a servant of Abraam; <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> and the Lord has
  blessed my master greatly, and he is exalted, and he has given him sheep, and
  calves, and silver, and gold, servants and servant-maids, camels, and asses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Sarrha my master’s wife bore one
  son to my master after he had grown old; and he gave him whatever he had.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And my master caused me to swear,
  saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the
  Chananites, among whom I sojourn in their land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But thou shalt go to the house of my father, and
  to my tribe, and thou shalt take thence a wife for my son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And I said to my master, Haply the woman shall
  not go with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And he said to me,
  The Lord God to whom I have been acceptable in his presence, himself shall
  send out his angel with thee, and shall prosper thy journey, and thou shalt
  take a wife for my son of my tribe, and of the house of my father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Then shalt thou be clear from my
  curse, for whensoever thou shalt have come to my tribe, and they shall not
  give her to thee, then shalt thou be clear from my oath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And having come this day to the well, I said,
  Lord God of my master Abraam, if thou prosperest my journey on which I am now
  going, <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> behold, I stand by the well of
  water, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water, and
  it shall be that the damsel to whom I shall say, Give me a little water to
  drink out of thy pitcher, <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and she
  shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will draw water for thy camels, this
  shall be the wife whom the Lord has prepared for his own servant Isaac; and
  hereby shall I know that thou hast wrought mercy with my master Abraam.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And it came to pass before I had done
  speaking in my mind, straightway Rebecca came forth, having her pitcher on
  her shoulders; and she went down to the well, and drew water; and I said to
  her, Give me to drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And she hasted
  and let down her pitcher on her arm from her head, and said, Drink thou, and
  I will give thy camels drink; and I drank, and she gave the camels drink.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And I asked her, and said, Whose
  daughter art thou? tell me; and she said, I am daughter of Bathuel the son of
  Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him; and I put on her the ear-rings, and the
  bracelets on her hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And being
  well-pleased I worshipped the Lord, and I blessed the Lord the God of my
  master Abraam, who has prospered me in a true way, so that I should take the
  daughter of my master’s brother for his son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> If then ye will deal mercifully and justly with
  my lord, tell me, and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or
  to the left. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And Laban and Bathuel
  answered and said, This matter has come forth from the Lord, we shall not be
  able to answer thee bad or good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span>
  Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go away, and let her be wife to
  the son of thy master, as the Lord has said. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And it came to pass when the servant of Abraam
  heard these words, he bowed himself to the Lord down to the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And the servant having brought forth
  jewels of silver and gold and raiment, gave them to Rebecca, and gave gifts
  to her brother, and to her mother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span>
  And both he and the men with him ate and drank and went to sleep. And he
  arose in the morning and said, Send me away, that I may go to my master.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And her brethren and her mother said,
  Let the virgin remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall
  depart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> But he said to them, Hinder
  me not, for the Lord has prospered my journey for me; send me away, that I
  may depart to my master. <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And they
  said, Let us call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> And they called Rebecca, and said to her, Wilt
  thou go with this man? and she said, I will go. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> So they sent forth Rebecca their sister, and her
  goods, and the servant of Abraam, and his attendants. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou
  art our sister; become thou thousands of myriads and let thy seed possess the
  cities of their enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And Rebecca
  rose up and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went with the man;
  and the servant having taken up Rebecca, departed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And Isaac went through the wilderness to the well
  of the vision, and he dwelt in the land toward the south. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And Isaac went forth into the plain toward
  evening to meditate; and having lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> And Rebecca lifted up her eyes, and
  saw Isaac; and she alighted briskly from the camel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> and said to the servant, Who is that man that
  walks in the plain to meet us? And the servant said, This is my master; and
  she took her veil and covered herself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> And Isaac went into the house of his
  mother, and took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and
  Isaac was comforted for Sarrha his mother.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis25">25</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Abraam again took a wife, whose
  name was Chettura. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And she bore to him
  Zombran, and Jezan, and Madal, and Madiam, and Jesboc, and Soie. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jezan begot Saba and Dedan. And the sons of
  Dedan were the Assurians and the Latusians, and Laomim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the sons of Madiam were Gephar and Aphir, and
  Enoch, and Abeida, and Eldaga; all these were sons of Chettura. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Abraam gave all his possessions to Isaac his
  son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But to the sons of his concubines
  Abraam gave gifts, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, while he was yet
  living, to the east into the country of the east. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And these were the years of the days of the life
  of Abraam as many as he lived, a hundred and seventy-five years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Abraam failing died in a good old age, an old
  man and full of days, and was added to his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the
  double cave, in the field of Ephron the son of Saar the Chettite, which is
  over against Mambre: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> even the field
  and the cave which Abraam bought of the sons of Chet; there they buried
  Abraam and Sarrha his wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And it
  came to pass after Abraam was dead, that God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac
  dwelt by the well of the vision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  these are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraam, whom Agar the Egyptian
  the hand-maid of Sarrha bore to Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And these are the names of the sons of Ismael,
  according to the names of their generations. The first-born of Ismael,
  Nabaioth, and Kedar, and Nabdeel, and Massam, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and Masma, and Duma, and Masse, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and Choddan, and Thæman, and Jetur, and Naphes,
  and Kedma. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> These are the sons of
  Ismael, and these are their names in their tents and in their dwellings,
  twelve princes according to their nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And these are the years of the life of Ismael, a
  hundred and thirty-seven years; and he failed and died, and was added to his
  fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he dwelt from Evilat
  unto Sur, which is opposite Egypt, until one comes to the Assyrians; he dwelt
  in the presence of all his brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  And these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Abraam begot Isaac. And Isaac was forty years old
  when he took to wife Rebecca, daughter of Bathuel the Syrian, out of Syrian
  Mesopotamia, sister of Laban the Syrian. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Isaac prayed the Lord concerning Rebecca his
  wife, because she was barren; and the Lord heard him, and his wife Rebecca
  conceived in her womb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the babes
  leaped within her; and she said, If it will be so with me, why is this to me?
  And she went to enquire of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And the Lord said to her, There are two nations in thy womb, and two peoples
  shall be separated from thy belly, and one people shall excel the other, and
  the elder shall serve the younger. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered, and she had twins
  in her womb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the first came out
  red, hairy all over like a skin; and she called his name Esau. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And after this came forth his brother, and his
  hand took hold of the heel of Esau; and she called his name Jacob. And Isaac
  was sixty years old when Rebecca bore them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the lads grew, and Esau was a man skilled in
  hunting, dwelling in the country, and Jacob a simple man, dwelling in a
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Isaac loved Esau, because
  his venison was his food, but Rebecca loved Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Jacob cooked pottage, and Esau came from the
  plain, fainting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Esau said to
  Jacob, Let me taste of that red pottage, because I am fainting; therefore his
  name was called Edom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Jacob said
  to Esau, Sell me this day thy birthright. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and for
  what good does this birthright belong to me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Jacob said to him, Swear to me this day; and
  he swore to him; and Esau sold his birthright to Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Jacob gave bread to Esau, and pottage of
  lentiles; and he ate and drank, and he arose and departed; so Esau slighted
  his birthright.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis26">26</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And there was a famine in the land,
  besides the former famine, which was in the time of Abraam; and Isaac went to
  Abimelech the king of the Phylistines to Gerara. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord appeared to him and said, Go not down
  to Egypt, but dwell in the land, which I shall tell thee of. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee,
  and bless thee, for I will give to thee and to thy seed all this land; and I
  will establish my oath which I swore to thy father Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
  heaven; and I will give to thy seed all this land, and all the nations of the
  earth shall be blest in thy seed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Because Abraam thy father hearkened to my voice, and kept my injunctions, and
  my commandments, and my ordinances, and my statutes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Isaac dwelt in Gerara. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the men of the place questioned him concerning
  Rebecca his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is
  my wife, lest at any time the men of the place should slay him because of
  Rebecca, because she was fair. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he
  remained there a long time, and Abimelech the king of Gerara leaned to look
  through the window, and saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Abimelech called Isaac and said to
  him, Is she then thy wife? why hast thou said, She is my sister? And Isaac,
  said to him, I did so, for I said, Lest at any time I die on her account.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Abimelech said to him, Why hast
  thou done this to us? one of my kindred within a little had lain with thy
  wife, and thou wouldst have brought a sin of ignorance upon us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying,
  Every man that touches this man and his wife shall be liable to death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Isaac sowed in that land, and he
  found in that year barley an hundred-fold, and the Lord blessed him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the man was exalted, and
  advancing he increased, till he became very great. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he had cattle of sheep, and cattle of oxen,
  and many tilled lands, and the Phylistines envied him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And all the wells which the servants of his
  father had dug in the time of his father, the Phylistines stopped them, and
  filled them with earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Abimelech
  said to Isaac, Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Isaac departed thence, and rested
  in the valley of Gerara, and dwelt there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which the
  servants of his father Abraam had dug, and the Phylistines had stopped them,
  after the death of his father Abraam; and he gave them names, according to
  the names by which his father named them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley of
  Gerara, and they found there a well of living water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the shepherds of Gerara strove with the
  shepherds of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and they called the
  name of the well, Injury, for they injured him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And having departed thence he dug another well,
  and they strove also for that; and he named the name of it, Enmity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he departed thence and dug
  another well; and they did not strive about that; and he named the name of
  it, Room, saying, Because now the Lord has made room for us, and has
  increased us upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  went up thence to the well of the oath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Lord appeared to him in that night, and
  said, I am the God of Abraam thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I
  will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraam thy father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he built there an altar, and
  called on the name of the Lord, and there he pitched his tent, and there the
  servants of Isaac dug a well in the valley of Gerara. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Abimelech came to him from Gerara, and
  Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Isaac said to them, Wherefore
  have ye come to me? whereas ye hated me, and sent me away from you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they said, We have surely seen
  that the Lord was with thee, and we said, Let there be an oath between us and
  thee, and we will make a covenant with thee, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> that thou shalt do no wrong by us, as we have not
  abhorred thee, and according as we have treated thee well, and have sent thee
  forth peaceably; and now thou art blessed of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he made a feast for them, and they ate and
  drank. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they arose in the morning,
  and swore each to his neighbour; and Isaac sent them forth, and they departed
  from him in safety. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And it came to
  pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him of the well
  which they had dug; and they said, We have not found water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he called it, Oath; therefore he called the
  name of that city, the Well of Oath, until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Esau was forty years old; and he took to wife
  Judith the daughter of Beoch the Chettite, and Basemath, daughter of Helon
  the Chettite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And they were provoking
  to Isaac and Rebecca.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after Isaac was
  old, that his eyes were dimmed so that he could not see; and he called Esau,
  his elder son, and said to him, My son; and he said, Behold, I am here.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said, Behold, I am grown old,
  and know not the day of my death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Now
  then take thy weapons, both thy quiver and thy bow, and go into the plain,
  and get me venison, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and make me meats,
  as I like them, and bring them to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless
  thee, before I die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Rebecca heard
  Isaac speaking to Esau his son; and Esau went to the plain to procure venison
  for his father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Rebecca said to
  Jacob her younger son, Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy
  brother, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Bring me venison, and
  prepare me meats, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before I die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now then, my son, hearken to me, as I
  command thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And go to the cattle and
  take for me thence two kids, tender and good, and I will make them meats for
  thy father, as he likes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou
  shalt bring them in to thy father, and he shall eat, that thy father may
  bless thee before he dies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Jacob
  said to his mother Rebecca, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I a smooth
  man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Peradventure my father may feel
  me, and I shall be before him as one ill-intentioned, and I shall bring upon
  me a curse, and not a blessing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  his mother said to him, On me be thy curse, Son; only hearken to my voice,
  and go and bring them me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> So he went
  and took and brought them to his mother; and his mother made meats, as his
  father liked them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Rebecca having
  taken the fine raiment of her elder son Esau which was with her in the house,
  put it on Jacob her younger son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  she put on his arms the skins of the kids, and on the bare parts of his neck.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And she gave the meats, and the
  loaves which she had prepared, into the hands of Jacob her son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he brought them to his father, and said,
  Father; and he said, Behold I am here; who art thou, son? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Jacob said to his father, I, Esau thy
  first-born, have done as thou toldest me, rise, sit, and eat of my venison,
  that thy soul may bless me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Isaac
  said to his son, What is this which thou hast quickly found? And he said,
  That which the Lord thy God presented before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Isaac said to Jacob, Draw nigh to me, and I
  will feel thee, son, if thou art my son Esau or not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Jacob drew nigh to his father Isaac, and he
  felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands
  of Esau. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he knew him not, for his
  hands were as the hands of his brother Esau, hairy; and he blessed him,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and he said, Art thou my son Esau?
  and he said, I am. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he said, Bring
  hither, and I will eat of thy venison, Son, that my soul may bless thee; and
  he brought it near to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine, and he drank.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Isaac his father said to him,
  Draw nigh to me, and kiss me, son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And he drew nigh and kissed him, and smelled the smell of his garments, and
  blessed him, and said, Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of an
  abundant field, which the Lord has blessed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And may God give thee of the dew of heaven, and
  of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And let nations serve thee, and princes bow down
  to thee, and be thou lord of thy brother, and the sons of thy father shall do
  thee reverence; accursed is he that curses thee, and blessed is he that
  blesses thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And it came to pass
  after Isaac had ceased blessing his son Jacob, it even came to pass, just
  when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his
  brother came in from his hunting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And
  he also had made meats and brought them to his father; and he said to his
  father, Let my father arise and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may
  bless me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Isaac his father said
  to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy first-born son Esau. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Isaac was amazed with very great amazement,
  and said, Who then is it that has procured venison for me and brought it to
  me? and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and I have blessed him; and
  he shall be blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And it came to
  pass when Esau heard the words of his father Isaac, he cried out with a great
  and very bitter cry, and said, Bless, I pray thee, me also, father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he said to him, Thy brother has
  come with subtlety, and taken thy blessing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he said, Rightly was his name called Jacob,
  for lo! this second time has he supplanted me; he has both taken my
  birthright, and now he has taken my blessing; and Esau said to his father,
  Hast thou not left a blessing for me, father? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Isaac answered and said to Esau, If I have
  made him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants, and have
  strengthened him with corn and wine, what then shall I do for thee, Son?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Esau said to his father, Hast
  thou only one blessing, father? Bless, I pray thee, me also, father. And
  Isaac being troubled, Esau cried aloud and wept. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Isaac his father answered and said to him,
  Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
  heaven from above. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And thou shalt
  live by thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother; and there shall be a time
  when thou shalt break and loosen his yoke from off thy neck. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Esau was angry with Jacob because of the
  blessing, with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his mind, Let
  the days of my father’s mourning draw nigh, that I may slay my brother Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And the words of Esau her elder son
  were reported to Rebecca, and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and
  said to him, Behold, Esau thy brother threatens thee to kill thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Now then, my son, hear my voice, and
  rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia to Laban my brother into Charran.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And dwell with him certain days,
  until thy brother’s anger <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> and rage
  depart from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; and I will send
  and fetch thee thence, lest at any time I should be bereaved of you both in
  one day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Rebecca said to Isaac, I
  am weary of my life, because of the daughters of the sons of Chet; if Jacob
  shall take a wife of the daughters of this land, wherefore should I live?</p>

  <h3 id="genesis28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Isaac having called for Jacob,
  blessed him, and charged him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the
  daughters of the Chananites. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Rise and
  depart quickly into Mesopotamia, to the house of Bathuel the father of thy
  mother, and take to thyself thence a wife of the daughters of Laban thy
  mother’s brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And may my God bless
  thee, and increase thee, and multiply thee, and thou shalt become gatherings
  of nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And may he give thee the
  blessing of my father Abraam, even to thee and to thy seed after thee, to
  inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> So Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went into
  Mesopotamia to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca
  the mother of Jacob and Esau. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Esau
  saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Mesopotamia of Syria as he
  blessed him, to take to himself a wife thence, and that he charged him,
  saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and that Jacob hearkened to his father
  and his mother, and went to Mesopotamia of Syria. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Esau also having seen that the daughters of
  Chanaan were evil before his father Isaac, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Esau went to Ismael, and took Maeleth the daughter
  of Ismael, the son of Abraam, the sister of Nabeoth, a wife in addition to
  his other wives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Jacob went forth
  from the well of the oath, and departed into Charrhan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And came to a certain place and slept there, for
  the sun had gone down; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it
  at his head, and lay down to sleep in that place, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and dreamed, and behold a ladder fixed on the
  earth, whose top reached to heaven, and the angels of God ascended and
  descended on it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord stood
  upon it, and said, I am the God of thy father Abraam, and the God of Isaac;
  fear not, the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
  seed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thy seed shall be as the
  sand of the earth; and it shall spread abroad to the sea, and the south, and
  the north, and to the east; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the tribes
  of the earth be blessed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And behold I
  am with thee to preserve thee continually in all the way wherein thou shalt
  go; and I will bring thee back to this land; for I will not desert thee,
  until I have done all that I have said to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, The
  Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he was afraid, and said, How fearful is this
  place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jacob rose up in the
  morning, and took the stone he had laid there by his head, and he set it up
  as a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he called the name of that place, the House
  of God; and the name of the city before was Ulam-luz. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If the Lord God
  will be with me, and guard me throughout on this journey, on which I am
  going, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and bring me back in safety to the house of my
  father, then shall the Lord be for a God to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar,
  shall be to me a house of God; and of all whatsoever thou shalt give me, I
  will tithe a tenth for thee.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis29">29</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob started and went to the
  land of the east to Laban, the son of Bathuel the Syrian, and the brother of
  Rebecca, mother of Jacob and Esau. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  he looks, and behold! a well in the plain; and there were there three flocks
  of sheep resting at it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, but
  there was a great stone at the mouth of the well. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And there were all the flocks gathered, and they
  used to roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the flocks,
  and set the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jacob said to them, Brethren, whence are ye?
  and they said, We are of Charrhan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  he said to them, Know ye Laban, the son of Nachor? and they said, We do know
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he said to them, Is he well?
  And they said, He is well. And behold Rachel his daughter came with the
  sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jacob said, it is yet high
  day, it is not yet time that the flocks be gathered together; water ye the
  flocks, depart and feed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they
  said, We shall not be able, until all the shepherds be gathered together, and
  they shall roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, then we will water
  the flocks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> While he was yet speaking
  to them, behold, Rachel the daughter of Laban came with her father’s sheep,
  for she fed the sheep of her father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s
  brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, that Jacob came and
  rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of
  Laban, his mother’s brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  Jacob kissed Rachel, and cried with a loud voice and wept. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he told Rachel that he was the near relative
  of her father, and the son of Rebecca; and she ran and reported to her father
  according to these words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came
  to pass when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet
  him, and embraced and kissed him, and brought him into his house; and he told
  Laban all these sayings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Laban
  said to him, Thou art of my bones and of my flesh; and he was with him a full
  month. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Laban said to Jacob,
  Surely thou shalt not serve me for nothing, because thou art my brother; tell
  me what thy reward is to be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Now
  Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lea, and the name of the
  younger, Rachel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the eyes of Lea
  were weak. But Rachel was beautiful in appearance, and exceedingly fair in
  countenance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jacob loved Rachel,
  and said, I will serve thee seven years for thy younger daughter Rachel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Laban said to him, It is better
  that I should give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man;
  dwell with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jacob served for
  Rachel seven years, and they were before him as a few days, by reason of his
  loving her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jacob said to Laban,
  Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Laban gathered together all the
  men of the place, and made a marriage-feast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And it was even, and he took his daughter Lea,
  and brought her in to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Laban gave to his daughter Lea, Zelpha his
  handmaid, as a handmaid for her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  it was morning, and behold it was Lea; and Jacob said to Laban, What is this
  that thou hast done unto me? did I not serve thee for Rachel? and wherefore
  hast thou deceived me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Laban
  answered, It is not done thus in our country, to give the younger before the
  elder. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Fulfil then her sevens, and I
  will give to thee her also in return for thy labour, which thou labourest
  with me, yet seven other years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  Jacob did so, and fulfilled her sevens; and Laban gave him his daughter
  Rachel to wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Laban gave to his
  daughter his handmaid Balla, for a handmaid to her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he went in to Rachel; and he loved Rachel
  more than Lea; and he served him seven other years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And when the Lord God saw that Lea was hated, he
  opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Lea conceived and bore a son to Jacob; and
  she called his name, Ruben; saying, Because the Lord has looked on my
  humiliation, and has given me a son, now then my husband will love me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And she conceived again, and bore a
  second son to Jacob; and she said, Because the Lord has heard that I am
  hated, he has given to me this one also; and she called his name, Simeon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And she conceived yet again, and bore
  a son, and said, In the present time my husband will be with me, for I have
  born him three sons; therefore she called his name, Levi. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And having conceived yet again, she bore a son,
  and said, Now yet again this time will I give thanks to the Lord; therefore
  she called his name, Juda; and ceased bearing.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis30">30</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Rachel having perceived that
  she bore Jacob no children, was jealous of her sister; and said to Jacob,
  Give me children; and if not, I shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said to her,
  Am I in the place of God, who has deprived thee of the fruit of the womb?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Rachel said to Jacob, Behold my
  handmaid Balla, go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also
  shall have children by her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And she
  gave him Balla her maid, for a wife to him; and Jacob went in to her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Balla, Rachel’s maid, conceived,
  and bore Jacob a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Rachel said,
  God has given judgment for me, and hearkened to my voice, and has given me a
  son, therefore she called his name, Dan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Balla, Rachel’s maid, conceived yet again, and
  bore a second son to Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Rachel
  said, God has helped me, and I contended with my sister and prevailed; and
  she called his name, Nephthalim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  Lea saw that she ceased from bearing, and she took Zelpha her maid, and gave
  her to Jacob for a wife; and he went in to her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived, and bore
  Jacob a son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Lea said, It is
  happily: and she called his name, Gad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Zelpha the maid of Lea conceived yet again,
  and bore Jacob a second son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Lea
  said, I am blessed, for the women will pronounce me blessed; and she called
  his name, Aser. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Ruben went in the
  day of barley-harvest, and found apples of mandrakes in the field, and
  brought them to his mother Lea; and Rachel said to Lea her sister, Give me of
  thy son’s mandrakes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Lea said, Is
  it not enough for thee that thou hast taken my husband, wilt thou also take
  my son’s mandrakes? And Rachel said, Not so: let him lie with thee to-night
  for thy son’s mandrakes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Jacob
  came in out of the field at even; and Lea went forth to meet him, and said,
  Thou shalt come in to me this day, for I have hired thee for my son’s
  mandrakes; and he lay with her that night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And God hearkened to Lea, and she conceived, and
  bore Jacob a fifth son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Lea said,
  God has given me my reward, because I gave my maid to my husband; and she
  called his name Issachar, which is, Reward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Lea conceived again, and bore Jacob a sixth
  son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Lea said, God has given me a
  good gift in this time; my husband will choose me, for I have born him six
  sons: and she called his name, Zabulon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And after this she bore a daughter; and she
  called her name, Dina. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And God
  remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and he opened her womb.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And she conceived, and bore Jacob a
  son; and Rachel said, God has taken away my reproach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let God
  add to me another son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And it came to
  pass when Rachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I
  may go to my place and to my land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Restore my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may
  depart, for thou knowest the service wherewith I have served thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Laban said to him, If I have
  found grace in thy sight, I would augur well, for the Lord has blessed me at
  thy coming in. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Appoint me thy wages,
  and I will give them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Jacob said,
  Thou knowest in what things I have served thee, and how many cattle of thine
  are with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For it was little thou
  hadst before my time, and it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord God
  has blessed thee since my coming; now then, when shall I set up also my own
  house? <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Laban said to him, What
  shall I give thee? and Jacob said to him, Thou shalt not give me anything; if
  thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again tend thy flocks and keep them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Let all thy sheep pass by to-day, and
  separate thence every grey sheep among the rams, and every one that is
  speckled and spotted among the goats—this shall be my reward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And my righteousness shall answer for me on the
  morrow, for it is my reward before thee: whatever shall not be spotted and
  speckled among the goats, and grey among the rams, shall be stolen with me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Laban said to him, Let it be
  according to thy word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he
  separated in that day the spotted and speckled he-goats, and all the spotted
  and speckled she-goats, and all that was grey among the rams, and every one
  that was white among them, and he gave them into the hand of his sons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he set a distance of a three days’
   journey between them and Jacob. And Jacob tended the cattle of Laban that
  were left behind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Jacob took to
  himself green rods of storax tree and walnut and plane-tree; and Jacob peeled
  in them white stripes; and as he drew off the green, the white stripe which
  he had made appeared alternate on the rods. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the
  hollows of the watering-troughs, that whensoever the cattle should come to
  drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might
  conceive at the rods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> So the cattle
  conceived at the rods, and the cattle brought forth young speckled, and
  streaked and spotted with ash-coloured spots. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Jacob separated the lambs, and set before the
  sheep a speckled ram, and every variegated one among the lambs, and he
  separated flocks for himself alone, and did not mingle them with the sheep of
  Laban. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And it came to pass in the
  time wherein the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put
  the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the
  rods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But he did not put them in
  indiscriminately whenever the cattle happened to bring forth, but the
  unmarked ones were Laban’s, and the marked ones Jacob’s. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And the man became very rich, and he had many
  cattle, and oxen, and servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis31">31</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob heard the words of the
  sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and of our
  father’s property has he gotten all this glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold
  it was not toward him as before. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the Lord said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy father, and to thy family,
  and I will be with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jacob
  sent and called Lea and Rachel to the plain where the flocks were.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to them, I see the face of
  your father, that it is not toward me as before, but the God of my father was
  with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye too know that with all
  my might I have served your father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  But your father deceived me, and changed my wages for the ten lambs, yet God
  gave him not power to hurt me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If he
  should say thus, The speckled shall be thy reward, then all the cattle would
  bear speckled; and if he should say, The white shall be thy reward, then
  would all the cattle bear white. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> So
  God has taken away all the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it came to pass when the cattle
  conceived and were with young, that I beheld with mine eyes in sleep, and
  behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats,
  speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-coloured spots. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the angel of God said to me in a dream,
  Jacob; and I said, What is it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he
  said, Look up with thine eyes, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping
  on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with
  ash-coloured spots; for I have seen all things that Laban does to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I am God that appeared to thee in the
  place of God, where thou anointedst a pillar to me, and vowedst to me there a
  vow; now then arise and depart out of this land, depart into the land of thy
  nativity, and I will be with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And Rachel and Lea answered and said to him, Have we yet a part or
  inheritance in the house of our father? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Are we not considered strangers by him? for he
  has sold us, and quite devoured our money. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> All the wealth and the glory which God has taken
  from our father, it shall be our’s and our children’s; now then do whatsoever
  God has said to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jacob arose
  and took his wives and his children up on the camels; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and he took away all his possessions and all his
  store, which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to
  depart to Isaac his father in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel
  stole her father’s images. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jacob
  hid the matter from Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he ran away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he departed himself and all that
  belonged to him, and passed over the river, and went into the mountain
  Galaad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But it was told Laban the
  Syrian on the third day, that Jacob was fled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And having taken his brethren with him, he
  pursued after him seven days’ journey, and overtook him on Mount Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And God came to Laban the Syrian in
  sleep by night, and said to him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not at
  any time to Jacob evil things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban
  stationed his brothers in the mount Galaad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done?
  wherefore didst thou run away secretly, and pillage me, and lead away my
  daughters as captives taken with the sword? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Whereas if thou hadst told me, I would have sent
  thee away with mirth, and with songs, and timbrels, and harp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And I was not counted worthy to embrace my
  children and my daughters; now then thou hast wrought foolishly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And now my hand has power to hurt thee; but the
  God of thy father spoke to me yesterday, saying, Take heed to thyself that
  thou speak not evil words to Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  Now then go on thy way, for thou hast earnestly desired to depart to the
  house of thy father; wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I
  was afraid; for I said, Lest at any time thou shouldest take away thy
  daughters from me, and all my possessions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Jacob said, With whomsoever thou shalt find
  thy gods, he shall not live in the presence of our brethren; take notice of
  what I have of thy property, and take it; and he observed nothing with him,
  but Jacob knew not that his wife Rachel had stolen them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Laban went in and searched in the house of
  Lea, and found them not; and he went out of the house of Lea, and searched in
  the house of Jacob, and in the house of the two maid-servants, and found them
  not; and he went also into the house of Rachel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And Rachel took the idols, and cast them among
  the camels’ packs, and sat upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  And she said to her father, Be not indignant, Sir: I cannot rise up before
  thee, for it is with me according to the manner of women. Laban searched in
  all the house, and found not the images. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And Jacob was angry, and strove with Laban; and
  Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my injustice, and what my sin, that
  thou hast pursued after me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and that
  thou hast searched all the furniture of my house? what hast thou found of all
  the furniture of thine house? set it here between thy relations and my
  relations, and let them decide between us two. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> These twenty years have I been with thee; thy
  sheep, and thy she-goats have not failed in bearing; I devoured not the rams
  of thy cattle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> That which was taken
  of beasts I brought not to thee; I made good of myself the thefts of the day,
  and the thefts of the night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> I was
  parched with heat by day, and chilled with frost by night, and my sleep
  departed from my eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> These twenty
  years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two
  daughters, and six years among thy sheep, and thou didst falsely rate my
  wages for ten lambs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Unless I had the
  God of my father Abraam, and the fear of Isaac, now thou wouldest have sent
  me away empty; God saw my humiliation, and the labour of my hands, and
  rebuked thee yesterday. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And Laban
  answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my
  sons, and the cattle are my cattle, and all things which thou seest are mine,
  and the property of my daughters; what shall I do to them to-day, or their
  children which they bore? <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Now then
  come, let me make a covenant, both I and thou, and it shall be for a witness
  between me and thee; and he said to him, Behold, there is no one with us;
  behold, God is witness between me and thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Jacob having taken a stone, set it up for a
  pillar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Jacob said to his
  brethren, Gather stones; and they gathered stones and made a heap; and ate
  there upon the heap, and Laban said to him, This heap witnesses between me
  and thee to-day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And Laban called it,
  the Heap of Testimony; and Jacob called it, the Witness Heap. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and
  the pillar, which I have set between me and thee; this heap witnesses, and
  this pillar witnesses; therefore its name was called, the Heap witnesses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And the vision of which he said—Let
  God look to it between me and thee, because we are about to depart from each
  other,— <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> If thou shalt humble my
  daughters, if thou shouldest take wives in addition to my daughters, see,
  there is no one with us looking on. God is witness between me and thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold, this
  heap, and this pillar are a witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span>
  For if I should not cross over unto thee, neither shouldest thou cross over
  to me, for mischief beyond this heap and this pillar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> The God of Abraam and the God of Nachor judge
  between us; and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And he offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and
  called his brethren, and they ate and drank, and slept in the mountain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And Laban rose up in the morning,
  kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban having turned
  back, departed to his place.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis32">32</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob departed for his journey;
  and having looked up, he saw the host of God encamped; and the angels of God
  met him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jacob said, when he saw
  them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place,
  Encampments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jacob sent messengers
  before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he charged them, saying, Thus
  shall ye say to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob; I have sojourned
  with Laban and tarried until now. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and men-servants and
  women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that thy servant might find
  grace in thy sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the messengers
  returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and lo! he comes to
  meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was
  perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the
  camels, and the sheep, into two camps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and smite it, the other camp
  shall be in safety. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Jacob said,
  God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, thou art he that
  said to me, Depart quickly to the land of thy birth, and I will do thee good.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let there be to me a sufficiency of
  all the justice and all the truth which thou hast wrought with thy servant;
  for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two
  camps. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Deliver me from the hand of my
  brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should
  come and smite me, and the mother upon the children. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But thou saidst, I will do thee good, and will
  make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for
  multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he slept there that
  night, and took of the gifts which he carried with him, and sent out to Esau
  his brother, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> two hundred she-goats,
  twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty
  kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he gave them to his servants each drove
  apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between
  drove and drove. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he charged the
  first, saying, If Esau my brother meet thee, and he ask thee, saying, Whose
  art thou? and whither wouldest thou go, and whose are these possessions
  advancing before thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thou shalt
  say, Thy servant Jacob’s; he hath sent gifts to my lord Esau, and lo! he is
  behind us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he charged the first
  and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these
  flocks, saying, Thus shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and ye shall say, Behold thy servant Jacob comes
  after us. For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going
  before his presence, and afterwards I will behold his face, for peradventure
  he will accept me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> So the presents
  went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he rose up in that night, and
  took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and
  crossed over the ford of Jaboch. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his
  possessions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Jacob was left
  alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and
  he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob’s thigh
  was benumbed in his wrestling with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has
  dawned; but he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he said to him, What is thy name?
  and he answered, Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said
  to him, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy
  name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and shalt be mighty with men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Jacob asked and said, Tell me thy
  name; and he said, Wherefore dost thou ask after my name? and he blessed him
  there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jacob called the name of
  that place, the Face of God; for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and
  my life was preserved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the sun
  rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Therefore the children of Israel will
  by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part
  of the thigh, until this day, because the angel touched the broad part of the
  thigh of Jacob—even the sinew which was benumbed.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis33">33</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
  beheld, and lo! Esau his brother coming, and four hundred men with him; and
  Jacob divided the children to Lea and to Rachel, and the two handmaidens.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he put the two handmaidens and
  their children with the first, and Lea and her children behind, and Rachel
  and Joseph last. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he advanced
  himself before them, and did reverence to the ground seven times, until he
  drew near to his brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Esau ran
  on to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and
  they both wept. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Esau looked up and
  saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to thee? And he
  said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed thy servant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the maid-servants and their
  children drew near and did reverence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And Lea and her children drew near and did reverence; and after this drew
  near Rachel and Joseph, and did reverence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he said, What are these things to thee, all
  these companies that I have met? And he said, That thy servant might find
  grace in thy sight, my lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Esau
  said, I have much, my brother; keep thine own. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Jacob said, If I have found grace in thy
  sight, receive the gifts through my hands; therefore have I seen thy face, as
  if any one should see the face of God, and thou shalt be well-pleased with
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Receive my blessings, which I
  have brought thee, because God has had mercy on me, and I have all things;
  and he constrained him, and he took them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said, Let us depart, and proceed right
  onward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he said to him, My lord
  knows, that the children are very tender, and the flocks and the herds with
  me are with young; if then I shall drive them hard one day, all the cattle
  will die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Let my lord go on before
  his servant, and I shall have strength on the road according to the ease of
  the journey before me, and according to the strength of the children, until I
  come to my lord to Seir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Esau
  said, I will leave with thee some of the people who are with me. And he said,
  Why so? it is enough that I have found favour before thee, my lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Esau returned on that day on his
  journey to Seir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jacob departs to
  his tents; and he made for himself there habitations, and for his cattle he
  made booths; therefore he called the name of that place, Booths. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Jacob came to Salem, a city of Secima, which
  is in the land of Chanaan, when he departed out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and
  took up a position in front of the city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he bought the portion of the field, where he
  pitched his tent, of Emmor the father of Sychem, for a hundred lambs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he set up there an altar, and
  called on the God of Israel.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis34">34</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Dina, the daughter of Lea, whom
  she bore to Jacob, went forth to observe the daughters of the inhabitants.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Sychem the son of Emmor the Evite,
  the ruler of the land, saw her, and took her and lay with her, and humbled
  her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he was attached to the soul
  of Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and he spoke kindly
  to the damsel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Sychem spoke to Emmor
  his father, saying, Take for me this damsel to wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Jacob heard that the son of Emmor had defiled
  Dina his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the plain). And Jacob
  was silent until they came. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Emmor
  the father of Sychem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the sons of Jacob came from the plain; and
  when they heard, the men were deeply pained, and it was very grievous to
  them, because the man wrought folly in Israel, having lain with the daughter
  of Jacob, and so it must not be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And
  Emmor spoke to them, saying, Sychem my son has chosen in his heart your
  daughter; give her therefore to him for a wife, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters,
  and take our daughters for your sons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you,
  dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Sychem said to her father and to her
  brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever ye shall
  name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Multiply your demand of dowry
  very much, and I will give accordingly as ye shall say to me, only ye shall
  give me this damsel for a wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  the sons of Jacob answered to Sychem and Emmor his father craftily, and spoke
  to them, because they had defiled Dina their sister. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Symeon and Levi the brothers of Dina, said to
  them, We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who
  is uncircumcised, for it is a reproach to us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Only on these terms will we conform to you, and
  dwell among you, if ye also will be as we are, in that every male of you be
  circumcised. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And we will give our
  daughters to you, and we will take of your daughters for wives to us, and we
  will dwell with you, and we will be as one race. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if ye will not hearken to us to be
  circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the words pleased Emmor, and Sychem the son
  of Emmor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the young man delayed
  not to do this thing, for he was much attached to Jacob’s daughter, and he
  was the most honourable of all in his father’s house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Emmor and Sychem his son came to the gate of
  their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> These men are peaceable, let them dwell with us
  upon the land, and let them trade in it, and behold the land is extensive
  before them; we will take their daughters to us for wives, and we will give
  them our daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Only on these
  terms will the men conform to us to dwell with us so as to be one people, if
  every male of us be circumcised, as they also are circumcised. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And shall not their cattle and their herds, and
  their possessions, be ours? only in this let us conform to them, and they
  will dwell with us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And all that went
  in at the gate of their city hearkened to Emmor and Sychem his son, and they
  were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin every male. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when they
  were in pain, the two sons of Jacob, Symeon and Levi, Dina’s brethren, took
  each man his sword, and came upon the city securely, and slew every male.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they slew Emmor and Sychem his
  son with the edge of the sword, and took Dina out of the house of Sychem, and
  went forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But the sons of Jacob
  came upon the wounded, and ravaged the city wherein they had defiled Dina
  their sister. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And their sheep, and
  their oxen, and their asses they took, and all things whatsoever were in the
  city, and whatsoever were in the plain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they took captive all the persons of them,
  and all their store, and their wives, and plundered both whatever things
  there were in the city, and whatever things there were in the houses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Jacob said to Symeon and Levi, Ye
  have made me hateful so that I should be evil to all the inhabitants of the
  land, both among the Chananites and the Pherezites, and I am few in number;
  they will gather themselves against me and cut me in pieces, and I shall be
  utterly destroyed, and my house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And
  they said, Nay, but shall they treat our sister as an harlot?</p>

  <h3 id="genesis35">35</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up
  to the place, Bæthel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to the God
  that appeared to thee, when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jacob said to his house, and to
  all that were with him, Remove the strange gods that are with you from the
  midst of you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And let us rise and go up to Bæthel, and let us
  there make an altar to God who hearkened to me in the day of calamity, who
  was with me, and preserved me throughout in the journey, by which I went.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they gave to Jacob the strange
  gods, which were in their hands, and the ear-rings which were in their ears,
  and Jacob hid them under the turpentine tree which is in Secima, and
  destroyed them to this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> So Israel
  departed from Secima, and the fear of God was upon the cities round about
  them, and they did not pursue after the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of
  Chanaan, which is Bæthel, he and all the people that were with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he built there an altar, and
  called the name of the place Bæthel; for there God appeared to him, when he
  fled from the face of his brother Esau. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Deborrha, Rebecca’s nurse, died, and was
  buried below Bæthel under the oak; and Jacob called its name, The Oak of
  Mourning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God appeared to Jacob
  once more in Luza, when he came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and God blessed
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And God said to him, Thy name
  shall not be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his
  name Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And God said to him, I
  am thy God, increase and multiply; for nations and gatherings of nations
  shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the land which I gave to Abraam and Isaac, I
  have given it to thee; and it shall come to pass that I will give this land
  also to thy seed after thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And God
  went up from him from the place where he spoke with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God
  spoke with him, even a pillar of stone and offered a libation upon it, and
  poured oil upon it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Jacob called
  the name of the place in which God spoke with him, Bæthel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> [And Jacob removed from Bæthel, and pitched his
  tent beyond the tower of Gader,] and it came to pass when he drew nigh to
  Chabratha, to enter into Ephratha, Rachel travailed; and in her travail she
  was in hard labour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it came to
  pass in her hard labour, that the midwife said to her, Be of good courage,
  for thou shalt also have this son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And it came to pass in her giving up the ghost (for she was dying), that she
  called his name, The son of my pain; but his father called his name Benjamin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> So Rachel died, and was buried in the
  way of the course of Ephratha, this is Bethleem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Jacob set up a pillar on her tomb; this is
  the pillar on the tomb of Rachel, until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that
  land, that Ruben went and lay with Balla, the concubine of his father Jacob;
  and Israel heard, and the thing appeared grievous before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the sons of Jacob were twelve. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The sons of Lea, the first-born of Jacob; Ruben,
  Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar, Zabulon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the sons of Balla, the hand-maid
  of Rachel, Dan and Nephthalim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  the sons of Zelpha, the hand-maid of Lea; Gad and Aser. These are the sons of
  Jacob, which were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mambre, to
  a city of the plain; this is Chebron in the land of Chanaan, where Abraam and
  Isaac sojourned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the days of
  Isaac which he lived were a hundred and eighty years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Isaac gave up the ghost and died, and was
  laid to his family, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried
  him.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these are the generations of

  the Chettite; and Olibema, daughter of Ana the son of Sebegon, the Evite;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and Basemath, daughter of Ismael,

  And Olibema bore Jeus, and Jeglom, and Core; these are the sons of Esau,
  which were born to him in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his
  daughters, and all the persons of his house, and all his possessions, and all
  his cattle, and all that he had got, and all things whatsoever he had
  acquired in the land of Chanaan; and Esau went forth from the land of
  Chanaan, from the face of his brother Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For their substance was too great for them to
  dwell together; and the land of their sojourning could not bear them, because
  of the abundance of their possessions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  And Esau dwelt in mount Seir; Esau, he is Edom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And these are the generations of Esau the father
  of Edom in the mount Seir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And these
  are the names of the sons of Esau. Eliphas, the son of Ada, the wife of Esau;

  These are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau. <span style=

  Some, and Moze. These were the sons of Basemath wife of Esau. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And these are the sons of Olibema, the daughter
  of Ana, the son of Sebegon, the wife of Esau; and she bore to Esau, Jeus, and

  And these are the sons of Seir, the Chorrhite, who inhabited the land; Lotan,
  Sobal, Sebegon, Ana, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and Deson, and
  Asar, and Rison. These are the chiefs of the Chorrhite, the son of Seir, in

  Lotan were Chorrhi and Hæman; and the sister of Lotan, Thamna. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And these are the sons of Sobal; Golam, and
  Manachath, and Gæbel, and Sophar, and Omar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And these are the sons of Sebegon; Aïe, and Ana;
  this is the Ana who found Jamin in the wilderness, when he tended the beasts
  of his father Sebegon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And these are
  the sons of Ana; Deson—and Olibema was daughter of Ana. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And these are the kings which reigned

  <h3 id="genesis37">37</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(36:44)</span> And Jacob dwelt in the land
  where his father sojourned, in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these are the generations of Jacob. And Joseph
  was seventeen years old, feeding the sheep of his father with his brethren,
  being young; with the sons of Balla, and with the sons of Zelpha, the wives
  of his father; and Joseph brought to Israel their father their evil reproach.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jacob loved Joseph more than all
  his sons, because he was to him the son of old age; and he made for him a
  coat of many colours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his brethren
  having seen that his father loved him more than all his sons, hated him, and
  could not speak anything peaceable to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and reported it to his
  brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he said to them, Hear
  this dream which I have dreamed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I
  thought ye were binding sheaves in the middle of the field, and my sheaf
  stood up and was erected, and your sheaves turned round, and did obeisance to
  my sheaf. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And his brethren said to
  him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us, or shalt thou indeed be lord over us?
  And they hated him still more for his dreams and for his words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he dreamed another dream, and related it to
  his father, and to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another
  dream: as it were the sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars did me
  reverence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And his father rebuked him,
  and said to him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamed? shall indeed
  both I and thy mother and thy brethren come and bow before thee to the earth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And his brethren envied him; but his
  father observed the saying. (11) And his brethren went to feed the sheep of
  their father to Sychem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Israel
  said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed their flock in Sychem? Come, I will
  send thee to them; and he said to him, Behold, I am here. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Israel said to him, Go and see if thy
  brethren and the sheep are well, and bring me word; and he sent him out of
  the valley of Chebron, and he came to Sychem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And a man found him wandering in the field; and
  the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he said, I am seeking my brethren; tell me
  where they feed their flocks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the
  man said to him, They have departed hence, for I heard them saying, Let us go
  to Dothaim; and Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothaim.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they spied him from a distance
  before he drew nigh to them, and they wickedly took counsel to slay him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And each said to his brother, Behold,
  that dreamer comes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Now then come,
  let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits; and we will say, An evil
  wild beast has devoured him; and we shall see what his dreams will be.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Ruben having heard it, rescued
  him out of their hands, and said, Let us not kill him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Ruben said to them, Shed not blood; cast him
  into one of these pits in the wilderness, but do not lay your hand upon him;
  that he might rescue him out of their hands, and restore him to his father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it came to pass, when Joseph came
  to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his many-coloured coat that was
  upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And they took him and cast
  him into the pit; and the pit was empty, it had not water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they sat down to eat bread and having lifted
  up their eyes they beheld, and lo, Ismaelitish travellers came from Galaad,
  and their camels were heavily loaded with spices, and resin, and myrrh; and
  they went to bring them to Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  Judas said to his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and
  conceal his blood? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Come, let us sell
  him to these Ismaelites, but let not our hands be upon him, because he is our
  brother and our flesh; and his brethren hearkened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the men, the merchants of Madian, went by,
  and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit; and sold Joseph to the
  Ismaelites for twenty pieces of gold; and they brought Joseph down into
  Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Ruben returned to the pit,
  and sees not Joseph in the pit, and he rent his garments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he returned to his brethren and said, The boy
  is not; and I, whither am I yet to go? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And having taken the coat of Joseph, they slew a
  kid of the goats, and stained the coat with the blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And they sent the coat of many colours; and they
  brought it to their father, and said, This have we found; know if it be thy
  sons’ coat or no. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he recognised
  it, and said, It is my son’s coat, an evil wild beast has devoured him; a
  wild beast has carried off Joseph. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for
  his son many days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And all his sons
  and his daughters gathered themselves together, and came to comfort him; but
  he would not be comforted, saying, I will go down to my son mourning to
  Hades; and his father wept for him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span>
  And the Madianites sold Joseph into Egypt; to Petephres, the eunuch of
  Pharao, captain of the guard.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis38">38</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass at that time
  that Judas went down from his brethren, and came as far as to a certain man
  of Odollam, whose name was Iras. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  Judas saw there the daughter of a Chananitish man, whose name was Sava; and
  he took her, and went in to her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  she conceived and bore a son, and called his name, Er. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And she conceived and bore a son again; and called
  his name, Aunan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And she again bore a
  son; and called his name, Selom; and she was in Chasbi when she bore them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Judas took a wife for Er his
  first-born, whose name was Thamar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  Er, the first-born of Judas, was wicked before the Lord; and God killed him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Judas said to Aunan, Go in to thy
  brother’s wife, and marry her as her brother-in-law, and raise up seed to thy
  brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Aunan, knowing that the
  seed should not be his—it came to pass when he went in to his brother’s wife,
  that he spilled it upon the ground, so that he should not give seed to his
  brother’s wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And his doing this
  appeared evil before God; and he slew him also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Judas said to Thamar, his daughter-in-law,
  Sit thou a widow in the house of thy father-in-law, until Selom my son be
  grown; for he said, lest he also die as his brethren; and Thamar departed,
  and sat in the house of her father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And the days were fulfilled, and Sava the wife of Judas died; and Judas,
  being comforted, went to them that sheared his sheep, himself and Iras their
  shepherd the Odollamite, to Thamna. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And it was told Thamar his daughter-in-law, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law
  goeth up to Thamna, to shear his sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And having taken off the garments of her
  widowhood from her, she put on a vail, and ornamented her face, and sat by
  the gates of Ænan, which is in the way to Thamna, for she saw that Selom was
  grown; but he gave her not to him for a wife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And when Judas saw her, thought her to be a
  harlot; for she covered her face, and he knew her not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he went out of his way to her, and said to
  her, Let me come in to thee; for he knew not that she was his
  daughter-in-law; and she said, What wilt thou give me if thou shouldest come
  in to me? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he said, I will send
  thee a kid of the goats from my flock; and she said, Well, if thou wilt give
  me an earnest, until thou send it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And he said, What is the earnest that I shall give thee? and she said, Thy
  ring, and thy bracelet, and the staff in thy hand; and he gave them to her,
  and went in to her, and she conceived by him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And she arose and departed, and took her veil
  from off her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hand
  of his shepherd the Odollamite, to receive the pledge from the woman; and he
  found her not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he asked the men
  of the place, Where is the harlot who was in Ænan by the way-side? and they
  said, There was no harlot here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And
  he returned to Judas, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the
  place say, There is no harlot here. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And Judas said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this
  kid, but thou hast not found her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  it came to pass after three months, that it was told Judas, saying, Thamar
  thy daughter-in-law has grievously played the harlot, and behold she is with
  child by whoredom; and Judas said, Bring her out, and let her be burnt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And as they were bringing her, she
  sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these
  things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Judas knew them, and said, Thamar
  is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Selom my son: and he
  knew her not again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And it came to
  pass when she was in labour, that she also had twins in her womb.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it came to pass as she was
  bringing forth, one thrust forth his hand, and the midwife having taken hold
  of it, bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This one shall come out
  first. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And when he drew back his
  hand, then immediately came forth his brother; and she said, Why has the
  barrier been cut through because of thee? and she called his name, Phares.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And after this came forth his
  brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread; and she called his name,
  Zara.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis39">39</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Joseph was brought down to
  Egypt; and Petephres the eunuch of Pharao, the captain of the guard, an
  Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ismaelites, who brought him down
  thither. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord was with Joseph,
  and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house with his lord the
  Egyptian. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his master knew that the
  Lord was with him, and the Lord prospers in his hands whatsoever he happens
  to do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Joseph found grace in the
  presence of his lord, and was well-pleasing to him; and he set him over his
  house, and all that he had he gave into the hand of Joseph. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And it came to pass after that he was set over his
  house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the house of the
  Egyptian for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all his
  possessions in the house, and in his field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he committed all that he had into the hands of
  Joseph; and he knew not of anything that belonged to him, save the bread
  which he himself ate. And Joseph was handsome in form, and exceedingly
  beautiful in countenance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it came
  to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph,
  and said, Lie with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But he would
  not; but said to his master’s wife, If because of me my master knows nothing
  in his house, and has given into my hands all things that belong to him:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and in this house there is nothing
  above me, nor has anything been kept back from me, but thou, because thou art
  his wife—how then shall I do this wicked thing, and sin against God?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And when she talked with Joseph day
  by day, and he hearkened not to her to sleep with her, so as to be with her,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> it came to pass on a certain day,
  that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and there was no one of
  the household within. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And she caught
  hold of him by his clothes, and said, Lie with me; and having left his
  clothes in her hands, he fled, and went forth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had
  left his clothes in her hands, and fled, and gone forth, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> that she called those that were in the house, and
  spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew servant to mock
  us—he came in to me, saying, Lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And when he heard that I lifted up my
  voice and cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled, and went forth
  out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> So she leaves the clothes by
  her, until the master came to his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And she spoke to him according to these words,
  saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou broughtest in to us, came in to me to
  mock me, and said to me, I will lie with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and
  cried, having left his clothes with me, he fled and departed forth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And it came to pass, when his master
  heard all the words of his wife, that she spoke to him, saying, Thus did thy
  servant to me, that he was very angry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And his master took Joseph, and cast him into the
  prison, into the place where the king’s prisoners are kept, there in the
  prison; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord was with Joseph,
  and poured down mercy upon him, and he gave him favour in the sight of the
  chief keeper of the prison. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the
  chief keeper of the prison gave the prison into the hand of Joseph, and all
  the prisonersas many as were in the prison; and all things whatsoever they do
  there, he did them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Because of him
  the chief keeper of the prison knew nothing, for all things were in the hand
  of Joseph, because the Lord was with him; and whatever things he did, the
  Lord made them to prosper in his hands.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis40">40</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after these
  things, that the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker
  trespassed against their lord the king of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Pharao was wroth with his two eunuchs, with
  his chief cupbearer, and with his chief baker. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he put them in ward, into the prison, into the
  place whereinto Joseph had been led. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And the chief keeper of the prison committed them to Joseph, and he stood by
  them; and they were some days in the prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they both had a dream in one night; and the
  vision of the dream of the chief cupbearer and chief baker, who belonged to
  the king of Egypt, who were in the prison, was this. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Joseph went in to them in the morning, and saw
  them, and they had been troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  he asked the eunuchs of Pharao who were with him in the prison with his
  master, saying, Why is it that your countenances are sad to-day? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they said to him, We have seen a dream, and
  there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Is not the
  interpretation of them through God? tell them then to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the chief cupbearer related his dream to
  Joseph, and said, In my dream a vine was before me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And in the vine were three stems; and it budding
  shot forth blossoms; the clusters of grapes were ripe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the cup of Pharao was in my hand; and I took
  the bunch of grapes, and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into
  Pharao’s hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Joseph said to
  him, This is the interpretation of it. The three stems are three days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Yet three days and Pharao shall
  remember thy office, and he shall restore thee to thy place of chief
  cupbearer, and thou shalt give the cup of Pharao into his hand, according to
  thy former high place, as thou wast wont to be cupbearer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But remember me of thyself, when it shall be well
  with thee, and thou shalt deal mercifully with me, and thou shalt make
  mention of me to Pharao, and thou shalt bring me forth out of this dungeon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For surely I was stolen away out of
  the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing, but they have cast me
  into this pit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the chief baker
  saw that he interpreted aright; and he said to Joseph, I also saw a dream,
  and methought I took up on my head three baskets of mealy food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And in the upper basket there was the work of the
  baker of every kind which Pharao eats; and the fowls of the air ate them out
  of the basket that was on my head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The
  three baskets are three days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Yet
  three days, and Pharao shall take away thy head from off thee, and shall hang
  thee on a tree, and the birds of the sky shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it came to pass on the third day
  that it was Pharao’s birth-day, and he made a banquet for all his servants,
  and he remembered the office of the cupbearer and the office of the baker in
  the midst of his servants. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he
  restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao’s
  hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he hanged the chief baker,
  as Joseph interpreted to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Yet
  did not the chief cupbearer remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis41">41</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after two full
  years that Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood upon the bank of the
  river. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And lo, there came up as it
  were out of the river seven cows, fair in appearance, and choice of flesh,
  and they fed on the sedge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And other
  seven cows came up after these out of the river, ill-favoured and
  lean-fleshed, and fed by the other cows on the bank of the river.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the seven ill-favoured and lean
  cows devoured the seven well-favoured and choice-fleshed cows; and Pharao
  awoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he dreamed again. And,
  behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, choice and good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And, behold, seven ears thin and blasted with the
  wind, grew up after them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  seven thin ears and blasted with the wind devoured the seven choice and full
  ears; and Pharao awoke, and it was a dream. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it was morning, and his soul was troubled; and
  he sent and called all the interpreters of Egypt, and all her wise men; and
  Pharao related to them his dream, and there was no one to interpret it to
  Pharao. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the chief cupbearer spoke
  to Pharao, saying, I this day remember my fault: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Pharao was angry with his servants, and put us in
  prison in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And we had a dream both in one night,
  I and he; we saw, each according to his dream. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew
  servant of the captain of the guard; and we related to him our dreams, and he
  interpreted them to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it came
  to pass, as he interpreted them to us, so also it happened, both that I was
  restored to my office, and that he was hanged. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Pharao having sent, called Joseph; and they
  brought him out from the prison, and shaved him, and changed his dress, and
  he came to Pharao. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Pharao said to
  Joseph, I have seen a vision, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have
  heard say concerning thee that thou didst hear dreams and interpret them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Joseph answered Pharao and said,
  Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharao. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream
  me thought I stood by the bank of the river; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and there came up as it were out of the river,
  seven cows well-favoured and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And behold seven other cows came up
  after them out of the river, evil and ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such
  that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the seven ill-favoured and thin cows ate up
  the seven first good and choice cows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And they went into their bellies, and it was not perceptible that they had
  gone into their bellies; and their appearance was ill-favoured, as also at
  the beginning; and after I awoke I slept, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven
  ears came up on one stem, full and good. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the
  wind, sprang up close to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I
  spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Joseph said to Pharao, The dream
  of Pharao is one; whatever God does, he has shewn to Pharao. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The seven good cows are seven years, and the
  seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharao is one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the seven thin kine that came up after them
  are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there
  shall be seven years of famine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  as for the word which I have told Pharao, whatsoever God intends to do, he
  has shewn to Pharao: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> behold, for
  seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But there shall come seven years of
  famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all
  Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by
  reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And concerning the repetition of the
  dream to Pharao twice, it is because the saying which is from God shall be
  true, and God will hasten to accomplish it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and
  set him over the land of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And
  let Pharao make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take
  up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years
  of the plenty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And let them gather
  all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be
  gathered under the hand of Pharao; let food be kept in the cities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the stored food shall be for the
  land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt;
  and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharao,
  and in the sight of all his servants. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  And Pharao said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who
  has the spirit of God in him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And
  Pharao said to Joseph, Since God has shewed thee all these things, there is
  not a wiser or more prudent man than thou. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Thou shalt be over my house, and all my people
  shall be obedient to thy word; only in the throne will I excel thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And Pharao said to Joseph, Behold, I
  set thee this day over all the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And Pharao took his ring off his hand, and put it
  on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a
  necklace of gold about his neck. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And
  he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation
  before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao; without
  thee no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Pharao called the name of Joseph,
  Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest
  of Heliopolis, to wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Joseph
  was thirty years old when he stood before Pharao, king of Egypt. And Joseph
  went out from the presence of Pharao, and went through all the land of Egypt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the land produced in the seven
  years of plenty, whole handfuls of corn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And he gathered all the food of the seven years,
  in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the
  cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And Joseph gathered very much corn as
  the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number
  of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And to Joseph were born two
  sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Aseneth, the daughter of
  Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And Joseph called the name of the first-born,
  Manasse; for God, said he, has made me forget all my toils and all my father’
  s house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And he called the name of
  the second, Ephraim; for God, said he, has increased me in the land of my
  humiliation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And the seven years of
  plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And the seven years of famine began to come, as
  Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of
  Egypt there was bread. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And all the
  land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharao for bread. And
  Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatsoever he shall
  tell you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> And the famine was on the
  face of all the earth; and Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold to all
  the Egyptians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> And all countries came
  to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis42">42</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob having seen that there
  was a sale of corn in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are ye indolent?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Behold I have heard that there is corn
  in Egypt; go down thither, and buy for us a little food, that we may live,
  and not die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the ten brethren of
  Joseph went down to buy corn out of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Jacob sent not Benjamin, the brother of
  Joseph, with his brethren; for he said, Lest, haply, disease befal him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the sons of Israel came to buy
  with those that came, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Joseph was ruler of the land; he sold to all
  the people of the land. And the brethren of Joseph, having come, did
  reverence to him, bowing with the face to the ground. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And when Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them,
  and estranged himself from them, and spoke hard words to them, and said to
  them; Whence are ye come? and they said, Out of the land of Chanaan, to buy
  food. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Joseph knew his brethren,
  but they knew not him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Joseph
  remembered his dream, which he saw; and he said to them, Ye are spies; to
  observe the marks of the land are ye come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But they said, Nay, Sir, we thy servants are come
  to buy food; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> we are all sons of one
  man; we are peaceable, thy servants are not spies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he said to them, Nay, but ye are come to
  observe the marks of the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, in the land of Chanaan, and
  behold, the youngest is with our father to-day, but the other one is not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Joseph said to them, This is it
  that I spoke to you, saying, ye are spies; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> herein shall ye be manifested; by the health of
  Pharao, ye shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come hither.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Send one of you, and take your
  brother; and go ye to prison, till your words be clear, whether ye speak the
  truth or not; but if not, by the health of Pharao, verily ye are spies.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he put them in prison three days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he said to them on the third day,
  This do, and ye shall live, for I fear God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> If ye be peaceable, let one of your brethren be
  detained in prison; but go ye, and carry back the corn ye have purchased.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And bring your younger brother to me,
  and your words shall be believed; but, if not, ye shall die. And they did so.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And each said to his brother, Yes,
  indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the
  anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we hearkened not unto him; and
  therefore has this affliction come upon us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak
  to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and ye heard me not? and, behold, his blood
  is required. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But they knew not that
  Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Joseph turned away from them, and
  wept; and again he came to them, and spoke to them; and he took Symeon from
  them, and bound him before their eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with
  corn, and to return their money to each into his sack, and to give them
  provision for the way; and it was so done to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And having put the corn on the asses, they
  departed thence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And one having
  opened his sack to give his asses, fodder, at the place where they rested,
  saw also his bundle of money, for it was on the mouth of his sack.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said to his brethren, my money
  has been restored to me, and behold this is in my sack. And their heart was
  wonder-struck, and they were troubled, saying one to another, What is this
  that God has done to us? <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And they
  came to their father, Jacob, into the land of Chanaan, and reported to him
  all that had happened to them, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The man, the lord of the land, spoke harsh words
  to us, and put us in prison as spies of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And we said to him, We are men of peace, we are
  not spies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> We are twelve brethren,
  sons of our father, one is not, and the youngest is with his father to-day in
  the land of Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the man, the
  lord of the land, said to us, Herein shall I know that ye are peaceable;
  leave one brother here with me, and having taken the corn ye have purchased
  for your family, depart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And bring to
  me your younger brother, then I shall know that ye are not spies, but that ye
  are men of peace: and I will restore you your brother, and ye shall trade in
  the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And it came to pass as they
  were emptying their sacks, there was each man’s bundle of money in his sack;
  and they and their father saw their bundles of money, and they were afraid.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And their father Jacob said to them,
  Ye have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will ye take Benjamin?
  all these things have come upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not
  to thee; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But he said, My son shall not go down
  with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and suppose
  it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which ye go, then ye
  shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis43">43</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But the famine prevailed in the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it came to pass, when they
  had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their
  father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord
  of the country, positively testified to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face,
  unless your younger brother be with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If, then, thou send our brother with us, we will
  go down, and buy thee food; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> but if
  thou send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us,
  saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Israel said, Why did ye harm me,
  inasmuch as ye told the man that ye had a brother? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they said, The man closely questioned us about
  our family also, saying, Does your father yet live, and have ye a brother?
  and we answered him according to this question: did we know that he would say
  to us, Bring your brother? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Judas
  said to his father Israel, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go,
  that we may live and not die, both we and thou, and our store. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I engage for him; at my hand do thou require
  him; if I bring him not to thee, and place him before thee, I shall be guilty
  toward thee for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For if we had
  not tarried, we should now have returned twice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Israel, their father, said to them, If it be
  so, do this; take of the fruits of the earth in your vessels, and carry down
  to the man presents of gum and honey, and frankincense, and stacte, and
  turpentine, and walnuts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And take
  double money in your hands, and the money that was returned in your sacks,
  carry back with you, lest peradventure it is a mistake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And take your brother; and arise, go down to the
  man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And my God give you favour in
  the sight of the man, and send away your other brother, and Benjamin, for I
  accordingly as I have been bereaved, am bereaved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the men having taken these presents, and the
  double money, took in their hands also Benjamin; and they rose up and went
  down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Joseph saw them and his brother Benjamin,
  born of the same mother; and he said to the steward of his household, Bring
  the men into the house, and slay beasts and make ready, for the men are to
  eat bread with me at noon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the
  man did as Joseph said; and he brought the men into the house of Joseph.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the men, when they perceived that
  they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because
  of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to
  inform against us and lay it to our charge; to take us, for servants, and our
  asses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having approached the man
  who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the
  house, <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> saying, We pray thee, Sir; we
  came down at first to buy food. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And
  it came to pass, when we came to unlade, and opened our sacks, there was also
  this money of each in his sack; we have now brought back our money by weight
  in our hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And we have brought
  other money with us to buy food; we know not who put the money into our
  sacks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he said to them, God deal
  mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers,
  has given you treasures in your sacks, and I have enough of your good money.
  And he brought Symeon out to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they prepared their gifts, until
  Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Joseph entered into the house,
  and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house;
  and they did him reverence with their face to the ground. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he asked them, How are ye? and he said to
  them, Is your father, the old man of whom ye spoke, well? Does he yet live?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they said, Thy servant our father
  is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God;—and they
  bowed, and did him reverence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother, Benjamin, born of the same
  mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother whom ye spoke of bringing
  to me? and he said, God have mercy on thee, my son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned
  over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and
  wept there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he washed his face
  and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they set on bread for him alone, and for them
  by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the
  Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to
  the Egyptians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And they sat before
  him, the first-born according to his seniority, and the younger according to
  his youth; and the men looked with amazement every one at his brother.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And they took their portions from him
  to themselves; but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as the portions
  of the others. And they drank and were filled with drink with him.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis44">44</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Joseph charged the steward of
  his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry,
  and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And put my silver cup into the sack of the
  youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of
  Joseph, as he said. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The morning
  dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And when they had gone out of the city, and were
  not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the
  men; and thou shalt overtake them, and say to them, Why have ye returned evil
  for good? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Why have ye stolen my silver
  cup? is it not this out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with
  it; ye have accomplished evil in that which ye have done. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he found them, and spoke to them according to
  these words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And they said to him, Why
  does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to
  do according to this word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If we
  brought back to thee out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in
  our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of thy lord?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> With whomsoever of thy servants thou
  shalt find the cup, let him die; and moreover, we will be servants to our
  lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he said, Now then it shall
  be as ye say; with whomsoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant,
  and ye shall be clear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they
  hasted, and took down every man his sack on the ground, and they opened every
  man his sack. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he searched,
  beginning from the eldest, until he came to the youngest; and he found the
  cup in Benjamin’s sack. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they rent
  their garments, and laid each man his sack on his ass, and returned to the
  city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Judas and his brethren came
  in to Joseph, while he was yet there, and fell on the ground before him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Joseph said to them, What is this
  thing that ye have done? know ye not that a man such as I can surely divine?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Judas said, What shall we answer
  to our lord, or what shall we say, or wherein should we be justified? whereas
  God has discovered the unrighteousness of thy servants; behold, we are slaves
  to our lord, both we and he with whom the cup has been found. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do this
  thing; the man with whom the cup has been found, he shall be my servant; but
  do ye go up with safety to your father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir,
  let thy servant speak a word before thee, and be not angry with thy servant;
  for thou art next to Pharao. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Sir,
  thou askedst thy servants, saying, Have ye a father or a brother?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And we said to my lord, we have a
  father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his
  brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his
  father loves him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And thou saidst to
  thy servants, Bring him down to me, and I will take care of him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And we said to my lord, The child will not be
  able to leave his father, but if he should leave his father, he will die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But thou saidst to thy servants,
  Except your younger brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face
  again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And it came to pass, when we
  went up to thy servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And our father said, Go again and buy
  us a little food. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And we said, We
  shall not be able to go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, we
  will go down, for we shall not be able to see the man’s face, our younger
  brother not being with us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And thy
  servant our father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and one is departed from me; and ye
  said that he was devoured of wild beasts, and I have not seen him until now.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> If then ye take this one also from my
  presence, and an affliction happen to him by the way, then shall ye bring
  down my old age with sorrow to the grave. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Now then, if I should go in to thy servant, and
  our father, and the boy should not be with us, (and his life depends on this
  lad’s life)— <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> it shall even come to
  pass, when he sees the boy is not with us, that he will die, and thy servants
  will bring down the old age of thy servant, and our father, with sorrow to
  the grave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For thy servant has
  received the boy in charge from his father, saying, If I bring him not to
  thee, and place him before thee, I shall be guilty towards my father for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Now then I will remain a
  servant with thee instead of the lad, a domestic of my lord; but let the lad
  go up with his brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For how
  shall I go up to my father, the lad not being with us? lest I behold the
  evils which will befal my father.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis45">45</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Joseph could not refrain
  himself when all were standing by him, but said, Dismiss all from me; and no
  one stood near Joseph, when he made himself known to his brethren.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he uttered his voice with weeping;
  and all the Egyptians heard, and it was reported to the house of Pharao.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Joseph said to his brethren, I am
  Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for
  they were troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Joseph said to
  his brethren, Draw nigh to me; and they drew nigh; and he said, I am your
  brother Joseph, whom ye sold into Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Now then be not grieved, and let it not seem hard
  to you that ye sold me hither, for God sent me before you for life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For this second year there is famine
  on the earth, and there are yet five years remaining, in which there is to be
  neither ploughing, nor mowing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For God
  sent me before you, that there might be left to you a remnant upon the earth,
  even to nourish a great remnant of you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now then ye did not send me hither, but God; and
  he hath made me as a father of Pharao, and lord of all his house, and ruler
  of all the land of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Hasten,
  therefore, and go up to my father, and say to him, These things saith thy son
  Joseph; God has made me lord of all the land of Egypt; come down therefore to
  me, and tarry not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt
  dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia; and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy
  sons, and thy sons’ sons, thy sheep and thine oxen, and whatsoever things are
  thine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I will nourish thee there:
  for the famine is yet for five years; lest thou be consumed, and thy sons,
  and all thy possessions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Behold, your
  eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that
  speaks to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Report, therefore to
  my father all my glory in Egypt, and all things that ye have seen, and make
  haste and bring down my father hither. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck, and
  wept on him; and Benjamin wept on his neck. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he kissed all his brethren and wept on them;
  and after these things his brethren spoke to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the report was carried into the house of
  Pharao, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come; and Pharao was glad, and his
  household. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Pharao said to Joseph,
  Say to thy brethren, Do this; fill your waggons, and depart into the land of
  Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And take up your father, and
  your possessions and come to me; and I will give you of all the goods of
  Egypt, and ye shall eat the marrow of the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And do thou charge them thus; that they should
  take for them waggons out of the land of Egypt, for your little ones, and for
  your wives; and take up your father, and come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And be not sparing in regard to your property,
  for all the good of Egypt shall be yours. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph
  gave to them waggons, according to the words spoken by king Pharao; and he
  gave them provision for the journey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And he gave to them all two sets of raiment apiece; but to Benjamin he gave
  three hundred pieces of gold, and five changes of raiment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And to his father he sent presents at the same
  rate, and ten asses bearing some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten
  mules, bearing bread for his father for thy journey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he sent away his brethren, and they went; and
  he said to them, Be not angry by the way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the
  land of Chanaan, to Jacob their father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they reported to him, saying, Thy son Joseph
  is living, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt; and Jacob was amazed,
  for he did not believe them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But they
  spoke to him all the words uttered by Joseph, whatsoever he said to them; and
  having seen the chariots which Joseph sent to take him up, the spirit of
  Jacob their father revived. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And
  Israel said, It is a great thing for me if Joseph my son is yet alive, I will
  go and see him before I die.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis46">46</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Israel departed, he and all
  that he had, and came to the well of the oath; and he offered sacrifice to
  the God of his father Isaac. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And God
  spoke to Israel in a night vision, saying, Jacob, Jacob; and he said, What is
  it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he says to him, I am the God
  of thy fathers; fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will make thee there a
  great nation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I will go down with
  thee into Egypt, and I will bring thee up at the end; and Joseph shall put
  his hands on thine eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Jacob
  rose up from the well of the oath; and the sons of Israel took up their
  father, and the baggage, and their wives on the waggons, which Joseph sent to
  take them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they took up their
  goods, and all their property, which they had gotten in the land of Chanaan;
  they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The sons, and the sons of his sons
  with him; his daughters, and the daughters of his daughters; and he brought
  all his seed into Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And these are
  the names of the sons of Israel that went into Egypt with their father Jacob—
  Jacob and his sons. The first-born of Jacob, Ruben. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the sons of Ruben; Enoch, and Phallus, Asron,
  and Charmi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the sons of Symeon;
  Jemuel, and Jamin, and Aod, and Achin, and Saar, and Saul the son of a
  Chananitish woman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the sons of
  Levi; Gerson, Cath, and Merari. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  the sons of Judas; Er, and Aunan, and Selom, and Phares, and Zara: and Er and
  Aunan died in the land of Chanaan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And the sons of Phares were Esron, and Jemuel. And the sons of Issachar;
  Thola, and Phua, and Asum, and Sambran. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the sons of Zabulun, Sered, and Allon, and
  Achoel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> These are the sons of Lea,
  which she bore to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, and Dina his daughter; all
  the souls, sons and daughters, thirty-three. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the sons of Gad; Saphon, and Angis, and
  Sannis, and Thasoban, and Aedis, and Aroedis, and Areelis. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the sons of Aser; Jemna, Jessua, and Jeul,
  and Baria; and Sara their sister. And the sons of Baria, Chobor, and
  Melchiil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> These are the sons of
  Zelpha, which Laban gave to his daughter Lea, who bore these to Jacob,
  sixteen souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the sons of
  Rachel, the wife of Jacob; Joseph, and Benjamin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And there were sons born to Joseph in the land of
  Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to
  him, even Manasses and Ephraim. And there were sons born to Manasses, which
  the Syrian concubine bore to him, even Machir. And Machir begot Galaad. And
  the sons of Ephraim, the brother of Manasses; Sutalaam, and Taam. And the
  sons of Sutalaam; Edom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the sons
  of Benjamin; Bala, and Bochor, and Asbel. And the sons of Bala were Gera, and
  Noeman, and Anchis and Ros, and Mamphim. And Gera begot Arad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> These are the sons of Rachel, which she bore to
  Jacob; all the souls eighteen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  the sons of Dan; Asom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the sons
  of Nephthalim; Asiel, and Goni, and Issaar, and Sollem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> These are the sons of Balla, whom Laban gave to
  his daughter Rachel, who bore these to Jacob; all the souls, seven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And all the souls that came with
  Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides the wives of the sons of
  Jacob, even all the souls were sixty-six. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in
  the land of Egypt were nine souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob who
  came with Joseph into Egypt, were seventy-five souls. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he sent Judas before him to Joseph, to meet
  him to the city of Heroes, into the land of Ramesses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And Joseph having made ready his chariots, went
  up to meet Israel his father, at the city of Heroes; and having appeared to
  him, fell on his neck, and wept with abundant weeping. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Israel said to Joseph, After this I will
  gladly die, since I have seen thy face, for thou art yet living. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Joseph said to his brethren, I will go up and
  tell Pharao, and will say to him, My brethren and my father’s house, who were
  in the land of Chanaan, are come to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the men are shepherds; for they have been
  feeders of cattle; and they have brought with them their cattle, and their
  kine, and all their property. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> If then
  Pharao call you, and say to you, What is your occupation? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Ye shall say, We thy servants are herdsmen from
  our youth until now, both we and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land
  of Gesem of Arabia, for every shepherd is an abomination to the
  Egyptians.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis47">47</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Joseph came and told Pharao,
  saying, My father, and my brethren, and their cattle, and their oxen, and all
  their possessions, are come out of the land of Chanaan, and, behold, they are
  in the land of Gesem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he took of
  his brethren five men, and set them before Pharao. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Pharao said to the brethren of Joseph, What is
  your occupation? and they said to Pharao, Thy servants are shepherds, both we
  and our fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they said to
  Pharao, We are come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the
  flocks of thy servants, for the famine has prevailed in the land of Chanaan;
  now then, we will dwell in the land of Gesem. And Pharao said to Joseph, Let
  them dwell in the land of Gesem; and if thou knowest that there are among
  them able men, make them overseers of my cattle. So Jacob and his sons came
  into Egypt, to Joseph; and Pharao, king of Egypt, heard of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father,
  and thy brethren, are come to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Behold, the land of Egypt is before thee; settle thy father and thy brethren
  in the best land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Joseph brought
  in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharao; and Jacob blessed Pharao.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Pharao said to Jacob, How many are
  the years of the days of thy life? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the years of my life, wherein I sojourn,
  are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years
  of my life, they have not attained to the days of the life of my fathers, in
  which days they sojourned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Jacob
  blessed Pharao, and departed from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Joseph settled his father and his brethren,
  and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the
  land of Ramesses, as Pharao commanded. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Joseph gave provision to his father, and his
  brethren, and to all the house of his father, corn for each person.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there was no corn in all the
  land, for the famine prevailed greatly; and the land of Egypt, and the land
  of Chanaan, fainted for the famine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and
  the land of Chanaan, in return for the corn which they bought, and he
  distributed corn to them; and Joseph brought all the money into the house of
  Pharao. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And all the money failed out
  of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Chanaan; and all the Egyptians
  came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread, and why do we die in thy presence? for
  our money is spent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Joseph said
  to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if
  your money is spent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they brought
  their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in return for their
  horses, and for their sheep, and for their oxen, and for their asses; and
  Joseph maintained them with bread for all their cattle in that year.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And that year passed, and they came
  to him in the second year, and said to him, Must we then be consumed from
  before our lord? for if our money has failed, and our possessions, and our
  cattle, brought to thee our lord, and there has not been left to us before
  our lord more than our own bodies and our land, we are indeed destitute.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> In order, then, that we die not
  before thee, and the land be made desolate, buy us and our land for bread,
  and we and our land will be servants to Pharao: give seed that we may sow,
  and live and not die, so our land shall not be made desolate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians,
  for Pharao; for the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao; for the famine
  prevailed against them, and the land became Pharao’s. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he brought the people into bondage to him,
  for servants, from one extremity of Egypt to the other, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> except only the land of the priests; Joseph
  bought not this, for Pharao gave a portion in the way of gift to the priests;
  and they ate their portion which Pharao gave them; therefore they sold not
  their land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Joseph said to all
  the Egyptians, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharao;
  take seed for you, and sow the land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And there shall be the fruits of it; and ye shall give the fifth part to
  Pharao, and the four remaining parts shall be for yourselves, for seed for
  the earth, and for food for you, and all that are in your houses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they said, Thou hast saved us; we
  have found favour before our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Joseph appointed it to them for
  an ordinance until this day; to reserve a fifth part for Pharao, on the land
  of Egypt, except only the land of the priests, that was not Pharao’s.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And Israel dwelt in Egypt, in the
  land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance upon it; and they increased and
  multiplied very greatly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Jacob
  survived seventeen years in the land of Egypt; and Jacob’s days of the years
  of his life were a hundred and forty-seven years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the days of Israel drew nigh for him to die:
  and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I have found favour before
  thee, put thy hand under my thigh, and thou shalt execute mercy and truth
  toward me, so as not to bury me in Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt
  carry me up out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will
  do according to thy word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And he
  said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel did reverence, leaning on
  the top of his staff.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis48">48</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass after these
  things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, thy father is ill; and,
  having taken his two sons Manasse and Ephraim, he came to Jacob. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, thy
  son Joseph cometh to thee; and Israel having strengthened himself, sat upon
  the bed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jacob said to Joseph, My
  God appeared to me in Luza, in the land of Chanaan, and blessed me,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and said to me, Behold, I will
  increase thee, and multiply thee, and will make of thee multitudes of
  nations; and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee, for
  an everlasting possession. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Now then
  thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to
  thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasse, as Ruben and Symeon they
  shall be mine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the children which
  thou shalt beget hereafter, shall be in the name of their brethren; they
  shall be named after their inheritances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And as for me, when I came out of Mesopotamia of
  Syria, Rachel, thy mother, died in the land of Chanaan, as I drew nigh to the
  horse-course of Chabratha of the land of Chanaan, so as to come to Ephratha;
  and I buried her in the road of the course; this is Bethlehem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And when Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he said,
  Who are these to thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Joseph said
  to his father, They are my sons, whom God gave me here; and Jacob said, Bring
  me them, that I may bless them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now
  the eyes of Israel were dim through age, and he could not see; and he brought
  them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I have not
  been deprived of seeing thy face, and lo! God has showed me thy seed also.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Joseph brought them out from
  between his knees, and they did reverence to him, with their face to the
  ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Joseph took his two sons,
  both Ephraim in his right hand, but on the left of Israel, and Manasse on his
  left hand, but on the right of Israel, and brought them near to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Israel having stretched out his
  right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim, and he was the younger; and his
  left hand on the head of Manasse, guiding his hands crosswise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he blessed them and said, The God in whose
  sight my fathers were well pleasing, even Abraam and Isaac, the God who
  continues to feed me from my youth until this day; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless
  these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my
  fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on
  the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Joseph having seen
  that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim—it seemed grievous
  to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the
  head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Joseph said to his father, Not so, father;
  for this is the first-born; lay thy right-hand upon his head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I
  know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger
  brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of
  nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he blessed them in that
  day, saying, In you shall Israel be blessed, saying, God make thee as Ephraim
  and Manasse; and he set Ephraim before Manasse. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God
  shall be with you, and restore you to the land of your fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And I give to thee Sicima, a select portion above
  thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and
  bow.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis49">49</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jacob called his sons, and said
  to them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Assemble yourselves, that I
  may tell you what shall happen to you in the last days. Gather yourselves
  together, and hear me, sons of Jacob; hear Israel, hear your father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ruben, thou art my first-born, thou my
  strength, and the first of my children, hard to be endured, hard and
  self-willed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thou wast insolent like
  water, burst not forth with violence, for thou wentest up to the bed of thy
  father; then thou defiledst the couch, whereupon thou wentest up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Symeon and Levi, brethren,
  accomplished the injustice of their cutting off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Let not my soul come into their counsel, and let
  not mine inward parts contend in their conspiracy, for in their wrath they
  slew men, and in their passion they houghed a bull. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Cursed be their wrath, for it was wilful, and
  their anger, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them
  in Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Juda, thy brethren have
  praised thee, and thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father’
   s sons shall do thee reverence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Juda
  is a lion’s whelp: from the tender plant, my son, thou art gone up, having
  couched thou liest as a lion, and as a whelp; who shall stir him up?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> A ruler shall not fail from Juda, nor
  a prince from his loins, until there come the things stored up for him; and
  he is the expectation of nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Binding his foal to the vine, and the foal of his ass to the branch of it, he
  shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> His eyes shall be more cheering than
  wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Zabulon shall dwell on the coast, and he shall be by a haven of ships, and
  shall extend to Sidon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Issachar has
  desired that which is good; resting between the inheritances. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And having seen the resting place that it was
  good, and the land that it was fertile, he subjected his shoulder to labour,
  and became a husbandman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Dan shall
  judge his people, as one tribe too in Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And let Dan be a serpent in the way, besetting
  the path, biting the heel of the horse (and the rider shall fall backward),
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> waiting for the salvation of the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Gad, a plundering troop shall
  plunder him; but he shall plunder him, pursuing him closely. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Aser, his bread shall be fat; and he shall yield
  dainties to princes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Nephthalim is a
  spreading stem, bestowing beauty on its fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Joseph is a son increased; my dearly loved son is
  increased; my youngest son, turn to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Against whom men taking evil counsel reproached
  him, and the archers pressed hard upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But their bow and arrows were mightily consumed,
  and the sinews of their arms were slackened by the hand of the mighty one of
  Jacob; thence is he that strengthened Israel from the God of thy father;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and my God helped thee, and he
  blessed thee with the blessing of heaven from above, and the blessing of the
  earth possessing all things, because of the blessing of the breasts and of
  the womb, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> the blessings of thy father
  and thy mother—it has prevailed above the blessing of the lasting mountains,
  and beyond the blessings of the everlasting hills; they shall be upon the
  head of Joseph, and upon the head of the brothers of whom he took the lead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Benjamin, as a ravening wolf, shall
  eat still in the morning, and at evening he gives food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> All these are the twelve sons of Jacob; and their
  father spoke these words to them; and he blessed them, he blessed each of
  them according to his blessing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  he said to them, I am added to my people; ye shall bury me with my fathers in
  the cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Chettite, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> in the double cave which is opposite Mambre, in
  the land of Chanaan, the cave which Abraam bought of Ephron the Chettite, for
  a possession of a sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> There
  they buried Abraam and Sarrha his wife; there they buried Isaac, and Rebecca
  his wife; there they buried Lea; <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> in
  the portion of the field, and of the cave that was in it, purchased of the
  sons of Chet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Jacob ceased giving
  charges to his sons; and having lifted up his feet on the bed, he died, and
  was gathered to his people.</p>

  <h3 id="genesis50">50</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Joseph fell upon his father’s
  face, and wept on him, and kissed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And Joseph commanded his servants the embalmers to embalm his father; and the
  embalmers embalmed Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they
  fulfilled forty days for him, for so are the days of embalming numbered; and
  Egypt mourned for him seventy days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And when the days of mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the princes of
  Pharao, saying, If I have found favour in your sight, speak concerning me in
  the ears of Pharao, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> My father
  adjured me, saying, In the sepulchre which I dug for myself in the land of
  Chanaan, there thou shalt bury me; now then I will go up and bury my father,
  and return again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Pharao said to
  Joseph, Go up, bury thy father, as he constrained thee to swear. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> So Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the
  servants of Pharao went up with him, and the elders of his house, and all the
  elders of the land of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And all
  the household of Joseph, and his brethren, and all the house of his father,
  and his kindred; and they left behind the sheep and the oxen in the land of
  Gesem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And there went up with him also
  chariots and horsemen; and there was a very great company. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad,
  which is beyond Jordan; and they bewailed him with a great and very sore
  lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw
  the mourning at the floor of Atad, and said, This is a great mourning to the
  Egyptians; therefore he called its name, The mourning of Egypt, which is
  beyond Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thus his sons did
  to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> So his sons carried him up
  into the land of Chanaan, and buried him in the double cave, which cave
  Abraam bought for possession of a burying place, of Ephrom the Chettite,
  before Mambre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Joseph returned to
  Egypt, he and his brethren, and those that had gone up with him to bury his
  father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And when the brethren of
  Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said, Let us take heed, lest at
  any time Joseph remember evil against us, and recompense to us all the evils
  which we have done against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  they came to Joseph, and said, Thy father adjured us before his death,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thus say ye to Joseph,
  Forgive them their injustice and their sin, forasmuch as they have done thee
  evil; and now pardon the injustice of the servants of the God of thy father.
  And Joseph wept while they spoke to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they came to him and said, We, these persons,
  are thy servants. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Joseph said to
  them, Fear not, for I am God’s. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Ye
  took counsel against me for evil, but God took counsel for me for good, that
  the matter might be as it is to-day, and much people might be fed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he said to them, Fear not, I will
  maintain you, and your families: and he comforted them, and spoke kindly to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he
  and his brethren, and all the family of his father; and Joseph lived a
  hundred and ten years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Joseph saw
  the children of Ephraim to the third generation; and the sons of Machir the
  son of Manasse were borne on the sides of Joseph. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Joseph spoke to his brethren, saying, I die,
  and God will surely visit you, and will bring you out of this land to the
  land concerning which God sware to our fathers, Abraam, Isaac, and Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And Joseph adjured the sons of
  Israel, saying, At the visitation with which God shall visit you, then ye
  shall carry up my bones hence with you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Joseph died, aged an hundred and ten years;
  and they prepared his corpse, and put him in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
