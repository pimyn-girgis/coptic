  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The word of the Lord which came to
  Joel the son of Bathuel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear these
  words, ye elders, and hearken all ye that inhabit the land. Have such things
  happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Tell your children concerning them, and let your
  children tell their children, and their children another generation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The leavings of the caterpillar has
  the locust eaten, and the leavings of the locust has the palmerworm eaten,
  and the leavings of the palmerworm has the cankerworm eaten. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Awake, ye drunkards, from your wine, and weep:
  mourn, all ye that drink wine to drunkenness: for joy and gladness and
  removed are from your mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For a
  strong and innumerable nation is come up against my land, their teeth are
  lion’s teeth, and their back teeth those of a lion’s whelp. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He has ruined my vine, and utterly broken my
  fig-trees: he has utterly searched my vine, and cast it down; he has peeled
  its branches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Lament to me more than a
  virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The meat-offering and drink-offering are removed
  from the house of the Lord: mourn, ye priests that serve at the altar of the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the plains languish: let
  the land mourn, for the corn languishes; the wine is dried up, the oil
  becomes scarce; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> the husbandmen are
  consumed: mourn your property on account of the wheat and barley; for the
  harvest has perished from off the field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The vine is dried up, and the fig-trees are
  become few; the pomegranate, and palm-tree, and apple, and all trees of the
  field are dried up: for the sons of men have have abolished joy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye
  priests: mourn, ye that serve at the altar: go in, sleep in sackcloths, ye
  that minister to God: for the meat-offering and drink-offering are withheld
  from the house of your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Sanctify
  a fast, proclaim a solemn service, gather the elders and all the inhabitants
  of the land into the house of your God, and cry earnestly to the Lord,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Alas, Alas, Alas for the day! for the
  day of the Lord is nigh, and it will come as trouble upon trouble.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Your meat has been destroyed before
  your eyes, joy and gladness from out of the house of your God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The heifers have started at their mangers, the
  treasures are abolished, the wine-presses are broken down; for the corn is
  withered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> What shall we store up for
  ourselves? the herds of cattle have mourned, because they had no pasture; and
  the flocks of sheep have been utterly destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> To thee, O Lord, will I cry: for fire has
  devoured the fair places of the wilderness, and a flame has burnt up all the
  trees of the field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the cattle of
  the field have looked up to thee: for the fountains of waters have been dried
  up, and fire has devoured the fair places of the wilderness.</p>

  <h3 id="joel2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Sound the trumpet in Sion, make a
  proclamation in my holy mountain, and let all the inhabitants of the land be
  confounded: for the day of the Lord is near; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> for a day of darkness and gloominess is near, a
  day of cloud and mist: a numerous and strong people shall be spread upon the
  mountains as the morning; there has not been from the beginning one like it,
  and after it there shall not be again even to the years of many generations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Before them is a consuming fire, and
  behind them is a flame kindled: the land before them is as a paradise of
  delight, and behind them a desolate plain: and there shall none of them
  escape. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Their appearance is as the
  appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they pursue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> As the sound of chariots on the tops of mountains
  shall they leap, and as the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble, and
  as a numerous and strong people setting themselves in array for battle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Before them shall the people be
  crushed: every face shall be as the blackness of a caldron. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> As warriors shall they run, and as men of war
  shall they mount on the walls; and each shall move in his right path, and
  they shall not turn aside from their tracks: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> and not one shall stand aloof from his brother:
  they shall go on weighed down with their arms, and they fall upon their
  weapons, yet shall they in no wise be destroyed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They shall seize upon the city, and run upon the
  walls, and go up upon the houses, and enter in through the windows as
  thieves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Before them the earth shall
  be confounded, and the sky shall be shaken: the sun and the moon shall be
  darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the Lord shall utter his voice before his
  host: for his camp is very great: for the execution of his words is mighty:
  for the day of the Lord is great, very glorious, and who shall be able to
  resist it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Now therefore, saith the
  Lord your God, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with
  weeping, and with lamentation: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and
  rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for
  he is merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy, and
  repents of evils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Who knows if he
  will return, and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a
  meat-offering and a drink-offering to the Lord your God? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Sound the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast,
  proclaim a solemn service: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> gather the
  people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the infants at
  the breast: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of
  her closet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Between the porch and the
  altar let the priests that minister to the Lord weep, and say, Spare thy
  people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen
  should rule over them, lest they should say among the heathen, Where is their
  God? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But the Lord was jealous of his
  land, and spared his people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the
  Lord answered and said to his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine,
  and oil, and ye shall be satisfied with them: and I will no longer make you a
  reproach among the Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And I
  will chase away from you the northern adversary, and will drive him away into
  a dry land, and I will sink his face in the former sea, and his back parts in
  the latter sea, and his ill savour shall come up, and his stink come up,
  because he has wrought great things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Be of good courage, O land; rejoice and be glad: for the Lord has done great
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Be of good courage, ye beasts
  of the plain, for the plains of the wilderness have budded, for the trees
  have borne their fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their
  strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Rejoice then and be glad,
  ye children of Sion, in the Lord your God: for he has given you food fully,
  and he will rain on you the early and the latter rain, as before.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the floors shall be filled with
  corn, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I will recompense you for the years which the
  locust, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, and the cankerworm have
  eaten, even my great army, which I sent against you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And ye shall eat abundantly, and be satisfied,
  and shall praise the name of the Lord your God for the things which he has
  wrought wonderfully with you: and my people shall not be ashamed for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And ye shall know that I am in the
  midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and that there is none else
  beside me; and my people shall no more be ashamed for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will
  pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
  prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see
  visions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And on my servants and on my
  handmaids in those days will I pour out of my Spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And I will shew wonders in heaven, and upon the
  earth, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the
  moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord come.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And it shall come to pass that
  whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount
  Sion and in Jerusalem shall the saved one be as the Lord has said, and they
  that have glad tidings preached to them, whom the Lord has called.</p>

  <h3 id="joel3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For, behold, in those days and at
  that time, when I shall have turned the captivity of Juda and Jerusalem,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I will also gather all the Gentiles,
  and bring them down to the valley of Josaphat, and will plead with them there
  for my people and my heritage Israel, who have been dispersed among the
  Gentiles; and these Gentiles have divided my land, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and cast lots over my people, and have given their
  boys to harlots, and sold their girls for wine, and have drunk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon,
  and all Galilee of the Gentiles? do ye render me a recompense? or do ye bear
  malice against me? quickly and speedily will I return your recompense on your
  own heads: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because ye have taken my
  silver and my gold, and ye have brought my choice ornaments into your
  temples; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and ye have sold the children
  of Juda and the children of Jerusalem to the children of the Greeks, that ye
  might expel them from their coasts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Therefore, behold, I will raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold
  them, and I will return your recompense on your own heads. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I will sell your sons and your daughters into
  the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them into captivity to
  a far distant nation: for the Lord has spoken it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Proclaim these things among the Gentiles; declare
  war, arouse the warriors, draw near and go up, all ye men of war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Beat your ploughshares into swords,
  and your sickles into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Gather yourselves together, and go in, all ye
  nations round about, and gather yourselves there; let the timid become a
  warrior. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Let them be aroused, let all
  the nations go up to the valley of Josaphat: for there will I sit to judge
  all the Gentiles round about. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Bring
  forth the sickles, for the vintage is come: go in, tread the grapes, for the
  press is full: cause the vats to overflow; for their wickedness is
  multiplied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Noises have resounded in
  the valley of judgment: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of
  judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The sun and the moon shall
  be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord shall cry out of Sion, and shall
  utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heaven and the earth shall be shaken,
  but the Lord shall spare his people, and shall strengthen the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And ye shall know that I am
  the Lord your God, who dwell in Sion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem shall be
  holy, and strangers shall not pass through her anymore. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that the
  mountains shall drop sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all
  the fountains of Juda shall flow with water, and a fountain shall go forth of
  the house of the Lord, and water the valley of flags. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Egypt shall be a desolation, and Idumea shall be
  a desolate plain, because of the wrongs of the children of Juda, because they
  have shed righteous blood in their land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and
  Jerusalem to all generations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I
  will make inquisition for their blood, and will by no means leave it
  unavenged: and the Lord shall dwell in Sion.</p>
