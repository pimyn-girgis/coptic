  <h3 id="haggai1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the second
  year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the firs day of the month,
  the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying, Speak
  to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son
  of Josedec, the high priest, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Thus saith the Lord Almighty, saying, This people say, The time is not come
  to build the house of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the word of the Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Is it time for you to dwell in your
  ceiled houses, whereas our house is desolate? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider
  your ways, I pray you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye have sown
  much, but brought in little; ye have eaten, and are not satisfied; ye have
  drunk, and are not satisfied with drink, ye have clothed yourselves, and have
  not become warm thereby: and he that earns wages has gathered them into a bag
  full of holes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thus saith the Lord
  Almighty; Consider your ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Go up to
  the mountain, and cut timber; build the house, and I will take pleasure in
  it, and be glorified, saith the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Ye looked for much, and there came little; and it was brought into the house,
  and I blew it away. Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because my house
  is desolate, and ye run everyone into his own house; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> therefore shall the sky withhold dew, and the
  earth shall keep back her produce. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And I will bring a sword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the
  corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and all that the earth produces,
  and upon the men, and upon the cattle, and upon all the labours of their
  hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Zorobabel the son of
  Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedec, the high
  priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of the Lord
  their God, and the words of the prophet Aggaeus, according as the Lord their
  God had sent him to them, and the people feared before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Aggaeus the Lordâ€™s messenger spoke among the
  messengers of the Lord to the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord stirred up the spirit of
  Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus
  the son of Josedec, the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of all the
  people; and they went in, and wrought in the house of the Lord Almighty their
  God,
  <h3 id="haggai2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1:14A)</span> on the four
  and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the seventh month, on the
  twenty-first day of the month, the Lord spoke by Aggaeus the prophet, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Speak now to Zorobabel the son of
  Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high
  priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Who is there of you that saw this house in her
  former glory? and how do ye now look upon it, as it were nothing before your
  eyes? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yet now be strong, O Zorobabel,
  saith the Lord; and strengthen thyself, O Jesus the high priest, the son of
  Josedec; and let all the people of the land strengthen themselves, saith the
  Lord, and work, for I am with you, saith the Lord Almighty; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and my Spirit remains in the midst of you; be of
  good courage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For thus saith the Lord
  Almighty; Yet once I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and
  the dry land; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and I will shake all
  nations, and the choice portions of all the nations shall come: and I will
  fill this house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, saith the
  Lord Almighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For the glory of this
  house shall be great, the latter more than the former, saith the Lord
  Almighty: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord Almighty, even
  peace of soul for a possession to every one that builds, to raise up this
  temple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> On the four and twentieth day
  of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came
  to Aggaeus the prophet, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thus
  saith the Lord Almighty; Inquire now of the priest concerning the law,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If a man should take holy
  flesh in the skirt of his garment, and the skirt of his garment should touch
  bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the
  priests answered and said, No. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  Aggaeus said, If a defiled person who is unclean by reason of a dead body,
  touch any of these, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered and said,
  It shall be defiled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Aggaeus
  answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith
  the Lord; and so are all the works of their hands: and whosoever shall
  approach them, shall be defiled [because of their early burdens: they shall
  be pained because of their toils; and ye have hated him that reproved in the
  gates]. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And now consider, I pray you,
  from this day and beforetime, before they laid a stone on a stone in the
  temple of the Lord, what manner of men ye were. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> When ye cast into the corn-bin twenty measures of
  barley, and there were only ten measures of barley: and ye went to the vat to
  draw out fifty measures, and there were but twenty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I smote you with barrenness, and with blasting,
  and all the works of your hands with hail; yet ye returned not to me, saith
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Set your hearts now to
  think from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth
  month, even from the day when the foundation of the temple of the Lord was
  laid; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> consider in your hearts,
  whether this shall be known on the corn-floor, and whether yet the vine, and
  the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-trees that bear no fruit are
  with you: from this day will I bless you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the word of the Lord came the second time to
  Aggaeus the prophet, on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Speak to Zorobabel the son of
  Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, saying, I shake the heaven, and the earth,
  and the sea, and the dry land; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and I
  will overthrow the thrones of kings, and I will destroy the power of the
  kings of the nations; and I will overthrow chariots and riders; and the
  horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword striving
  against his brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> In that day,
  saith the Lord Almighty, I will take thee, O Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel,
  my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a seal: for I have chosen
  thee, saith the Lord Almighty.
