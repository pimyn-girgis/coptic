  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The burden which the prophet
  Ambacum saw. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> How long, O Lord, shall I
  cry out, and thou wilt not hearken? how long shall I cry out to thee being
  injured, and thou wilt not save? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Wherefore hast thou shown me troubles and griefs to look upon, misery and
  ungodliness? judgment is before me, and the judge receives a reward.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Therefore the law is frustrated, and
  judgment proceeds not effectually, for the ungodly man prevails over the
  just; therefore perverse judgment will proceed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Behold, ye despisers, and look, and wonder
  marvelously, and vanish: for I work a work in your days, which ye will in no
  wise believe, though a man declare it to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Wherefore, behold, I stir up the Chaldeans, the
  bitter and hasty nation, that walks upon the breadth of the earth, to inherit
  tabernacles not his own. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He is
  terrible and famous; his judgment shall proceed of himself, and his dignity
  shall come out of himself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And his
  horses shall bound more swiftly than leopards, and they are fiercer than the
  wolves of Arabia: and his horsemen shall ride forth, and shall rush from far;
  and they shall fly as an eagle hasting to eat. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Destruction shall come upon ungodly men, resisting
  with their adverse front, and he shall gather the captivity as the sand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And he shall be at his ease with
  kings, and princes are his toys, and he shall mock at every strong-hold, and
  shall cast a mound, and take possession of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then shall he change his spirit, and he shall
  pass through, and make an atonement, saying, This strength belongs to my god.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Art not thou from the beginning, O
  Lord God, my Holy One? and surely we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast
  established it for judgment, and he has formed me to chasten with his
  correction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> His eye is too pure to
  behold evil doings, and to look upon grievous afflictions: wherefore dost
  thou look upon despisers? wilt thou be silent when the ungodly swallows up
  the just? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And wilt thou make men as
  the fishes of the sea, and as the reptiles which have no guide? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He has brought up destruction with a hook, and
  drawn one with a casting net, and caught another in his drags: therefore
  shall his heart rejoice and be glad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  Therefore will he sacrifice to his drag, and burn incense to his casting-net,
  because by them he has made his portion fat, and his meats choice.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore will he cast his net, and
  will not spare to slay the nations continually.</p>

  <h3 id="habakkuk2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I will stand upon my watch, and
  mount upon the rock, and watch to see what he will say by me, and what I
  shall answer when I am reproved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  the Lord answered me and said, Write the vision, and that plainly on a
  tablet, that he that reads it may run. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  For the vision is yet for a time, and it shall shoot forth at the end, and
  not in vain: though he should tarry, wait for him; for he will surely come,
  and will not tarry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If he should draw
  back, my soul has no pleasure in him: but the just shall live by my faith.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the arrogant man and the scorner,
  the boastful man, shall not finish anything; who has enlarged his desire as
  the grave, and like death he is never satisfied, and he will gather to
  himself all the nations, and will receive to himself all the peoples.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Shall not all these take up a parable
  against him? and a proverb to tell against him? and they shall say, Woe to
  him that multiplies to himself the possessions which are not his! how long?
  and who heavily loads his yoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For
  suddenly there shall arise up those that bite him, and they that plot against
  thee shall awake, and thou shalt be a plunder to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the
  nations that are left shall spoil thee, because of the blood of men, and the
  sins of the land and city, and of all that dwell in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Woe to him that covets an evil covetousness to his
  house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the
  power of evils. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou hast devised
  shame to thy house, thou hast utterly destroyed many nations, and thy soul
  has sinned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the stone shall cry
  out of the wall, and the beetle out of the timber shall speak. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Woe to him that builds a city with blood, and
  establishes a city by unrighteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Are not these things of the Lord Almighty? surely
  many people have been exhausted in the fire, and many nations have fainted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the earth shall be filled with
  the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; it shall cover them as water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Woe to him that gives his neighbour
  to drink the thick lees of wine, and intoxicates him, that he may look upon
  their secret parts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Drink thou also
  thy fill of disgrace instead of glory: shake, O heart, and quake, the cup of
  the right hand of the Lord has come round upon thee, and dishonour has
  gathered upon thy glory. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the
  ungodliness of Libanus shall cover thee, and distress because of wild beasts
  shall dismay thee, because of the blood of men, and the sins of the land and
  city, and of all that dwell in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  What profit it the graven image, that they have graven it? one has made it a
  molten work, a false image; for the maker has trusted in his work, to make
  dumb idols. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Woe to him that says to
  the wood, Awake, arise; and to the stone, Be thou exalted! whereas it is an
  image, and this is a casting of gold and silver, and there is no breath in
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But the Lord is in his holy
  temple: let all the earth fear before him.</p>

  <h3 id="habakkuk3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A PRAYER OF THE PROPHET AMBACUM,
  WITH A SONG. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> O Lord, I have heard thy
  report, and was afraid: I considered thy works, and was amazed: thou shalt be
  known between the two living creatures, thou shalt be acknowledged when the
  years draw nigh; thou shalt be manifested when the time is come; when my soul
  is troubled, thou wilt in wrath remember mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> God shall come from Thaeman, and the Holy One from
  the dark shady mount Pharan. Pause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  His excellence covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And
  his brightness shall be as light; there were horns in his hands, and he
  caused a mighty love of his strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Before his face shall go a report, and it shall go forth into the plains,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> the earth stood at his feet and
  trembled: he beheld, and the nations melted away: the mountains were
  violently burst through, the everlasting hills melted at his everlasting
  going forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Because of troubles I
  looked upon the tents of the Ethiopians: the tabernacles also of the land of
  Madiam shall be dismayed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Wast thou
  angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath against the rivers, or thine
  anger against the sea? for thou wilt mount on thine horses, and thy chariots
  are salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Surely thou didst bend
  they bow at scepters, saith the Lord. Pause. The land of rivers shall be torn
  asunder. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The nations shall see thee
  and be in pain, as thou dost divide the moving waters: the deep uttered her
  voice, and raised her form on high. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  The sun was exalted, and the moon stood still in her course: thy darts shall
  go forth at the light, at the brightness of the gleaming of thine arms.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thou wilt bring low the land with
  threatening, and in wrath thou wilt break down the nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy
  people, to save thine anointed: thou shalt bring death on the heads of
  transgressors; thou has brought bands upon their neck. Pause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou didst cut asunder the heads of princes with
  amazement, they shall tremble in it; they shall burst their bridles, they
  shall be as a poor man devouring in secret. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And thou dost cause thine horses to enter the
  sea, disturbing much water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I
  watched, and my belly trembled at the sound of the prayer of my lips, and
  trembling entered into my bones, and my frame was troubled within me; I will
  rest in the day of affliction, from going up to the people of my sojourning.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For though the fig-tree shall bear no
  fruit, and there shall be no produce on the vines; the labour of the olive
  shall fail, and the fields shall produce no food: the sheep have failed from
  the pasture, and there are no oxen at the cribs; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> yet I will exult in the Lord, I will joy in God
  my Saviour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The Lord God is my
  strength, and he will perfectly strengthen my feet; he mounts me upon high
  places, that I may conquer by his song.</p>
