  <h3 id="deuteronomy1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> These are
  the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the desert
  towards the west near the Red Sea, between Pharan Tophol, and Lobon, and
  Aulon, and the gold works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> It is a
  journey of eleven days from Choreb to mount Seir as far as Cades Barne.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And it came to pass in the fortieth
  year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to
  all the children of Israel, according to all things which the Lord commanded
  him for them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> after he had smitten
  Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon, and Og the king of Basan who
  dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  beyond Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The Lord your God spoke to us in
  Choreb, saying, Let it suffice you to have dwelt so long in this mountain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Turn ye and depart and enter into the
  mountain of the Amorites, and go to all that dwell near about Araba, to the
  mountain and the plain and to the south, and the land of the Chananites near
  the sea, and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Behold, God has delivered the land
  before you; go in and inherit the land, which I sware to your fathers,
  Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and to their seed after
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I spoke to you at that time,
  saying, I shall not be able by myself to bear you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The Lord your God has multiplied you, and,
  behold, ye are to-day as the stars of heaven for multitude. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Lord God of your fathers add to you a
  thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> How shall I alone be able to bear
  your labour, and your burden, and your gainsayings? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Take to yourselves wise and understanding and
  prudent men for your tribes, and I will set your leaders over you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye answered me and said, The
  thing which thou hast told us is good to do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So I took of you wise and understanding and
  prudent men, and I set them to rule over you as rulers of thousands, and
  rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and officers
  to your judges. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I charged your
  judges at that time, saying, Hear causes between your brethren, and judge
  rightly between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt not have respect to
  persons in judgment, thou shalt judge small and great equally; thou shalt not
  shrink from before the person of a man, for the judgment is God’s; and
  whatsoever matter shall be too hard for you, ye shall bring it to me, and I
  will hear it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I charged upon you
  at that time all the commands which ye shall perform. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And we departed from Choreb, and went through all
  that great wilderness and terrible, which ye saw, by the way of the mountain
  of the Amorite, as the Lord our God charged us, and we came as far as Cades
  Barne. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And I said to you, Ye have
  come as far as the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God gives to
  you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> behold, the Lord your God has
  delivered to us the land before you: go up and inherit it as the Lord God of
  your fathers said to you; fear not, neither be afraid. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And ye all came to me, and said, Let us send men
  before us, and let them go up to the land for us; and let them bring back to
  us a report of the way by which we shall go up, and of the cities into which
  we shall enter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the saying
  pleased me: and I took of you twelve men, one man of a tribe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And they turned and went up to the mountain, and
  they came as far as the valley of the cluster, and surveyed it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And they took in their hands of the fruit of the
  land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good which the Lord our
  God gives us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Yet ye would not go up,
  but rebelled against the words of the Lord our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because
  the Lord hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us
  into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Whither do we go up? and your brethren drew away
  your heart, saying, It is a great nation and populous, and mightier than we;
  and there are cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the
  sons of the giants. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And I said to
  you, Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> the Lord your God who goes before your face, he
  shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that
  he wrought for you in the land of Egypt; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and in this wilderness which ye saw, by the way
  of the mountain of the Amorite; how the Lord thy God will bear thee as a
  nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which ye
  have gone until ye came to this place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And in this matter ye believed not the Lord our
  God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> who goes before you in the way
  to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, shewing you the way by
  which ye go, and a cloud by day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And
  the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware,
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Not one of these men shall
  see this good land, which I sware to their fathers, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> except Chaleb the son of Jephonne, he shall see
  it; and to him I will give the land on which he went up, and to his sons,
  because he attended to the things of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the Lord was angry with me for your sake,
  saying, Neither shalt thou by any means enter therein. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Joshua the son of Naue, who stands by thee, he
  shall enter in there; do thou strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to
  inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And every young child who
  this day knows not good or evil, —they shall enter therein, and to them I
  will give it, and they shall inherit it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And ye turned and marched into the wilderness, in
  the way by the Red Sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And ye
  answered and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God; we will go up and
  fight according to all that the Lord our God has commanded us: and having
  taken every one his weapons of war, and being gathered together, ye went up
  to the mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And the Lord said to
  me, Tell them, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight, for I am not with
  you; thus shall ye not be destroyed before your enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken to me;
  and ye transgressed the commandment of the Lord; and ye forced your way and
  went up into the mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the
  Amorite who dwelt in that mountain came out to meet you, and pursued you as
  bees do, and wounded you from Seir to Herma. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And ye sat down and wept before the Lord our God,
  and the Lord hearkened not to your voice, neither did he take heed to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And ye dwelt in Cades many days, as
  many days as ye dwelt there.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And we
  turned and departed into the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea, as the
  Lord spoke to me, and we compassed mount Seir many days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said to me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ye have compassed this mount long enough; turn
  therefore toward the north. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And charge
  the people, saying, Ye are going through the borders of your brethren the
  children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall fear you, and dread you
  greatly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Do not engage in war against
  them, for I will not give you of their land even enough to set your foot
  upon, for I have given mount Seir to the children of Esau as an inheritance.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Buy food of them for money and eat,
  and ye shall receive water of them by measure for money, and drink.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the Lord our God has blessed thee
  in every work of thy hands. Consider how thou wentest through that great and
  terrible wilderness: behold, the Lord thy God has been with thee forty years;
  thou didst not lack any thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And we
  passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the way of
  Araba from Ælon and from Gesion Gaber; and we turned and passed by the way of
  the desert of Moab. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord said
  to me, Do not ye quarrel with the Moabites, and do not engage in war with
  them; for I will not give you of their land for an inheritance, for I have
  given Aroer to the children of Lot to inherit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Formerly the Ommin dwelt in it, a great and
  numerous nation and powerful, like the Enakim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> These also shall be accounted Raphain like the
  Enakim; and the Moabites call them Ommin. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Chorrhite dwelt in Seir before, and the
  sons of Esau destroyed them, and utterly consumed them from before them; and
  they dwelt in their place, as Israel did to the land of his inheritance,
  which the Lord gave to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now
  then, arise ye, said I, and depart, and cross the valley of Zaret.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the days in which we traveled
  from Cades Barne till we crossed the valley of Zaret, were thirty and eight
  years, until the whole generation of the men of war failed, dying out of the
  camp, as the Lord God sware to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them out of the midst of
  the camp, until they were consumed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And it came to pass when all the men of war dying out of the midst of the
  people had fallen, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that the Lord
  spoke to me, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thou shalt pass
  over this day the borders of Moab to Aroer; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and ye shall draw nigh to the children of Amman:
  do not quarrel with them, nor wage war with them; for I will not give thee of
  the land of the children of Amman for an inheritance, because I have given it
  to the children of Lot for an inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> It shall be accounted a land of Raphain, for the
  Raphain dwelt there before, and the Ammanites call them Zochommin.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> A great nation and populous, and
  mightier than you, as also the Enakim: yet the Lord destroyed them from
  before them, and they inherited their land, and they dwelt there instead of
  them until this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> As they did to
  the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, even as they destroyed the Chorrhite
  from before them, and inherited their country, and dwelt therein instead of
  them until this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Evites
  who dwell in Asedoth to Gaza, and the Cappadocians who came out of
  Cappadocia, destroyed them, and dwelt in their room. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Now then arise and depart, and pass over the
  valley of Arnon: behold, I have delivered into thy hands Seon the king of
  Esebon the Amorite, and his land: begin to inherit it: engage in war with him
  this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Begin to put thy terror and
  thy fear on the face of all the nations under heaven, who shall be troubled
  when they have heard thy name, and shall be in anguish before thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I sent ambassadors from the
  wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon king of Esebon with peaceable words, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I will pass through thy land: I will
  go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Thou shalt give me food for money,
  and I will eat; and thou shalt give me water for money, and I will drink; I
  will only go through on my feet: <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> as
  the sons of Esau did to me, who dwelt in Seir, and the Moabites who dwelt in
  Aroer, until I shall have passed Jordan into the land which the Lord our God
  gives us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Seon king of Esebon
  would not that we should pass by him, because the Lord our God hardened his
  spirit, and made his heart stubborn, that he might be delivered into thy
  hands, as on this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the Lord
  said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before thee Seon the king of
  Esebon the Amorite, and his land, and do thou begin to inherit his land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And Seon the king of Esebon came
  forth to meet us, he and all his people to war at Jassa. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the Lord our God delivered him before our
  face, and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And we took possession of all his cities at that
  time, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, and their wives, and
  their children; we left no living prey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Only we took the cattle captive, and took the
  spoil of the cities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> From Aroer,
  which is by the brink of the brook of Arnon, and the city which is in the
  valley, and as far as the mount of Galaad; there was not a city which escaped
  us: the Lord our God delivered all of them into our hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Only we did not draw near to the children of
  Amman, even all the parts bordering on the brook Jaboc, and the cities in the
  mountain country, as the Lord our God charged us.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And we
  turned and went by the way leading to Basan; and Og the king of Basan came
  out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edraim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the Lord said to me, Fear him not, for I have
  delivered him, and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou
  shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in
  Esebon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord our God delivered
  him into our hands, even Og the king of Basan, and all his people; and we
  smote him until we left none of his seed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And we mastered all his cities at that time; there
  was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country
  round about Argob, belonging to king Og in Basan: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars;
  besides the very many cities of the Pherezites. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> We utterly destroyed them as we dealt with Seon
  the king of Esebon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the
  women and the children, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and all the
  cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And we took at that time the land out
  of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan,
  extending from the brook of Arnon even unto Aermon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior, but the
  Amorite has called it Sanir. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> All the
  cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan as far as Elcha and Edraim,
  cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  For only Og the king of Basan was left of the Raphain: behold, his bed was a
  bed of iron; behold, it is in the chief city of the children of Ammon; the
  length of it is nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to
  the cubit of a man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And we inherited
  that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent
  Arnon, and half the mount of Galaad; and I gave his cities to Ruben and to
  Gad. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the rest of Galaad, and all
  Basan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasse, and all the
  country round about Argob, all that Basan; it shall be accounted the land of
  Raphain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jair the son of Manasse
  took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Gargasi and
  Machathi: he called them by his name Basan Thavoth Jair until this day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And to Machir I gave Galaad.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And to Ruben and to Gad I gave the
  land under Galaad as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook
  and as far as Jaboc; the brook is the border to the children Amman.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Araba and Jordan are the boundary
  of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea under Asedoth Phasga
  eastward. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I charged you at that
  time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm
  yourselves, every one that is powerful, and go before your brethren the
  children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Only your wives
  and your children and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), let them
  dwell in your cities which I have given you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> until the Lord your God give your brethren rest,
  as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the
  Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then ye shall return,
  each one to his inheritance which I have given you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your
  eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so
  shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which thou crossest
  over thither. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Ye shall not be afraid
  of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Lord God, thou hast begun to shew to
  thy servant thy strength, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy high
  arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as thou
  hast done, and according to thy might? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> I will therefore go over and see this good land
  that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilibanus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the Lord because of you did not regard me,
  and hearkened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice thee, speak
  not of this matter to me any more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Go
  up to the top of the quarried rock, and look with thine eyes westward, and
  northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes, for
  thou shalt not go over this Jordan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  And charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go
  before the face of this people, and he shall give them the inheritance of all
  the land which thou hast seen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And we
  abode in the valley near the house of Phogor.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And now,
  Israel, hear the ordinances and judgments, all that I teach you this day to
  do: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit
  the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Ye shall not add to the word which I command you,
  and ye shall not take from it: keep the commandments of the Lord our God, all
  that I command you this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Your eyes
  have seen all that the Lord our God did in the case of Beel-phegor; for every
  man that went after Beel-phegor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him
  from among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But ye that kept close
  to the Lord your God are all alive to-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Behold, I have shewn you ordinances and judgments
  as the Lord commanded me, that ye should do so in the land into which ye go
  to inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall keep and
  do them: for this is your wisdom and understanding before all nations, as
  many as shall hear all these ordinances; and they shall say, Behold, this
  great nation is a wise and understanding people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For what manner of nation is so great, which has
  God so near to them as the Lord our God is in all things in whatsoever we may
  call upon him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And what manner of
  nation is so great, which has righteous ordinances and judgments according to
  all this law, which I set before you this day? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Take heed to thyself, and keep thy heart
  diligently: forget not any of the things, which thine eyes have seen, and let
  them not depart from thine heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt
  teach thy sons and thy sons’ sons, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  even the things that happened in the day in which ye stood before the Lord
  our God in Choreb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather
  the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me
  all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And ye drew nigh and stood under the
  mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven: there was darkness,
  blackness, and tempest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord
  spoke to you out of the midst of the fire a voice of words, which ye heard:
  and ye saw no likeness, only ye heard a voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he announced to you his covenant, which he
  commanded you to keep, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two
  tables of stone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord
  commanded me at that time, to teach you ordinances and judgments, that ye
  should do them on the land, into which ye go to inherit it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And take good heed to your hearts, for ye saw no
  similitude in the day in which the Lord spoke to you in Choreb in the
  mountain out of the midst of the fire: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> lest ye transgress, and make to yourselves a
  carved image, any kind of figure, the likeness of male or female,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> the likeness of any beast of those
  that are on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird which flies under
  heaven, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> the likeness of any reptile
  which creeps on the earth, the likeness of any fish of those which are in the
  waters under the earth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and lest
  having looked up to the sky, and having seen the sun and the moon and the
  stars, and all the heavenly bodies, thou shouldest go astray and worship
  them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God has distributed to all the
  nations under heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But God took
  you, and led you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, out
  of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord God was angry with me for the things
  said by you, and sware that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I
  should not enter into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
  inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For I am to die in this
  land, and shall not pass over this Jordan; but ye are to pass over, and shall
  inherit this good land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Take heed to
  yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made
  with you, and ye transgress, and make to yourselves a graven image of any of
  the things concerning which the Lord thy God commanded thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a
  jealous God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And when thou shalt have
  begotten sons, and shalt have sons’ sons, and ye shall have dwelt a long time
  on the land, and shall have transgressed, and made a graven image of any
  thing, and shall have done wickedly before the Lord your God to provoke him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I call heaven and earth this day to
  witness against you, that ye shall surely perish from off the land, into
  which ye go across Jordan to inherit it there; ye shall not prolong your days
  upon it, but shall be utterly cut off. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the Lord shall scatter you among all nations,
  and ye shall be left few in number among all the nations, among which the
  Lord shall bring you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And ye shall
  there serve other gods, the works of the hands of men, wood and stones, which
  cannot see, nor can they hear, nor eat, nor smell. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And there ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye
  shall find him whenever ye shall seek him with all your heart, and with all
  your soul in your affliction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And all
  these things shall come upon thee in the last days, and thou shalt turn to
  the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Because the Lord thy God is a God of pity: he
  will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; he will not forget the covenant of
  thy fathers, which the Lord sware to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Ask of the former days which were before thee,
  from the day when God created man upon the earth, and beginning at the one
  end of heaven to the other end of heaven, if there has happened any thing
  like to this great event, if such a thing has been heard: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> if a nation have heard the voice of the living
  God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and hast lived;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> if God has assayed to go and take to
  himself a nation out of the midst of another nation with trial, and with
  signs, and with wonders, and with war, and with a mighty hand, and with a
  high arm, and with great sights, according to all the things which the Lord
  our God did in Egypt in thy sight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> So
  that thou shouldest know that the Lord thy God he is God, and there is none
  beside him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> His voice was made
  audible from heaven to instruct thee, and he shewed thee upon the earth his
  great fire, and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Because he loved thy fathers, he also
  chose you their seed after them, and he brought thee himself with his great
  strength out of Egypt, <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> to destroy
  nations great and stronger than thou before thy face, to bring thee in, to
  give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> An thou shalt know this day, and shalt consider
  in thine heart, that the Lord thy God he is God in heaven above, and on the
  earth beneath, and there is none else but he. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And keep ye his commandments, and his ordinances,
  all that I command you this day; that it may be well with thee, and with thy
  sons after thee, that ye may be long-lived upon the earth, which the Lord thy
  God giveth thee for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Then Moses
  separated three cities beyond Jordan on the east, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> that the slayer might flee thither, who should
  have slain his neighbour unintentionally, and should not have hated him in
  times past, and he shall flee to one of these cities and live: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Bosor in the wilderness, in the plain country of
  Ruben, and Ramoth in Galaad belonging to Gad, and Gaulon in Basan belonging
  to Manasse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> This is the law which
  Moses set before the children of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> These are the testimonies, and the ordinances,
  and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came
  out of the land of Egypt: <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> on the
  other side of Jordan, in the valley near the house of Phogor, in the land of
  Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon, whom Moses and the sons of
  Israel smote when they came out of the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And they inherited his land, and the land of Og
  king of Basan, two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan eastward.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> From Aroer, which is on the border of
  the brook Arnon, even to the mount of Seon, which is Aermon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> All Araba beyond Jordan eastward under Asedoth
  hewn in the rock.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Moses
  called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the ordinances and
  judgments, all that I speak in your ears this day, and ye shall learn them,
  and observe to do them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The Lord your
  God made a covenant with you in Choreb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord did not make this covenant with your
  fathers, but with you: ye are all here alive this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The Lord spoke to you face to face in the mountain
  out of the midst of the fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I
  stood between the Lord and you at that time to report to you the words of the
  Lord, (because ye were afraid before the fire, and ye went not up to the
  mountain) saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I am the Lord thy
  God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thou shalt have no other gods before
  my face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thou shalt not make to
  thyself an image, nor likeness of any thing, whatever things are in the
  heaven above, and whatever are in the earth beneath, and whatever are in the
  waters under the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thou shalt not
  bow down to them, nor shalt thou serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a
  jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third
  and fourth generation to them that hate me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and doing mercifully to thousands of them that
  love me, and that keep my commandments. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
  in vain, for the Lord thy God will certainly not acquit him that takes his
  name in vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Keep the sabbath day to
  sanctify it, as the Lord thy God commanded thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Six days thou shalt work, and thou shalt do all
  thy works; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but on the seventh day is
  the sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do in it no work, thou, and thy
  son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thine ox, and
  thine ass, and all thy cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of
  thee; that thy man-servant may rest, and thy maid, and thine ox, as well as
  thou. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And thou shalt remember that
  thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out
  thence with a mighty hand, and a high arm: therefore the Lord appointed thee
  to keep the sabbath day and to sanctify it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy
  God commanded thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live
  long upon the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt not commit murder. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thou shalt not commit adultery. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou shalt not steal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
  neighbour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou shalt not covet thy
  neighbour’s wife; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, nor his field,
  nor his man-servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any beast of
  his, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> These words the Lord spoke to all the assembly of
  you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire—there was darkness,
  blackness, storm, a loud voice—and he added no more, and he wrote them on two
  tables of stone, and he gave them to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out
  of the midst of the fire, for the mountain burned with fire, that ye came to
  me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and ye said, Behold, the Lord our God has shewn
  us his glory, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: this
  day we have seen that God shall speak to man, and he shall live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And now let us not die, for this great fire will
  consume us, if we shall hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, and we
  shall die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For what flesh is there
  which has heard the voice of the living God, speaking out of the midst of the
  fire, as we have heard, and shall live? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Do thou draw near, and hear all that the Lord our
  God shall say, and thou shalt speak to us all things whatsoever the Lord our
  God shall speak to thee, and we will hear, and do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the Lord heard the voice of your words as ye
  spoke to me; and the Lord said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of
  this people, even all things that they have said to thee. They have well said
  all that they have spoken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> O that
  there were such a heart in them, that they should fear me and keep my
  commands always, that it might be well with them and with their sons for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Go, say to them, Return ye to
  your houses; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> but stand thou here with
  me, and I will tell thee all the commands, and the ordinances, and the
  judgments, which thou shalt teach them, and let them do so in the land which
  I give them for an inheritance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  ye shall take heed to do as the Lord thy God commanded thee; ye shall not
  turn aside to the right hand or to the left, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> according to all the way which the Lord thy God
  commanded thee to walk in it, that he may give thee rest; and that it may be
  well with thee, and ye may prolong your days on the land which ye shall
  inherit.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And these
  are the commands, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as the Lord
  our God gave commandment to teach you to do so in the land on which ye enter
  to inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> That ye may fear the
  Lord your God, keep ye all his ordinances, and his commandments, which I
  command thee to-day, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons’ sons, all the days of
  thy life, that ye may live many days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do them, that it may be well with
  thee, and that ye may be greatly multiplied, as the Lord God of thy fathers
  said that he would give thee a land flowing with milk and honey: and these
  are the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded the children
  of Israel in the wilderness, when they had gone forth from the land of Egypt.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is
  one Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And thou shalt love the Lord
  thy God with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and all thy strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And these words, all that I command
  thee this day, shall be in thy heart and in thy soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And thou shalt teach them to thy children, and
  thou shalt speak of them sitting in the house, and walking by the way, and
  lying down, and rising up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou
  shalt fasten them for a sign upon thy hand, and it shall be immoveable before
  thine eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And ye shall write them on
  the lintels of your houses and of your gates. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God
  shall have brought thee into the land which he sware to thy fathers, to
  Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and beautiful cities
  which thou didst not build, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> houses
  full of all good things which thou didst not fill, wells dug in the rock
  which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards which thou didst not
  plant, then having eaten and been filled, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God that
  brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and
  him only shalt thou serve; and thou shalt cleave to him, and by his name thou
  shalt swear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Go ye not after other
  gods of the gods of the nations round about you; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> for the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is a
  jealous God, lest the Lord thy God be very angry with thee, and destroy thee
  from off the face of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thou
  shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as ye tempted him in the temptation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt by all means keep the
  commands of the Lord thy God, the testimonies, and the ordinances, which he
  commanded thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And thou shalt do
  that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God, that it may be well
  with thee, and that thou mayest go in and inherit the good land, which the
  Lord sware to your fathers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> to chase
  all thine enemies from before thy face, as the Lord said. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And it shall come to pass when thy son shall ask
  thee at a future time, saying, What are the testimonies, and the ordinances,
  and the judgments, which the Lord our God has commanded us? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Then shalt thou say to thy son, We were slaves to
  Pharao in the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought us forth thence with a
  mighty hand, and with a high arm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And
  the Lord wrought signs and great and grievous wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and
  on his house before us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  brought us out thence to give us this land, which he sware to give to our
  fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the Lord charged us to
  observe all these ordinances; to fear the Lord our God, that it may be well
  with us for ever, that we may live, as even to-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And there shall be mercy to us, if we take heed
  to keep all these commands before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when
  the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, into which thou goest to
  possess it, and shall remove great nations from before thee, the Chettite,
  and Gergesite, and Amorite, and Chananite, and Pherezite, and Evite, and
  Jebusite, seven nations more numerous and stronger than you, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy
  hands, then thou shalt smite them: thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou
  shalt not make a covenant with them, neither shall ye pity them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> neither shall ye contract marriages with them:
  thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, and thou shalt not take his
  daughter to thy son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For he will draw
  away thy son from me, and he will serve other gods; and the Lord will be very
  angry with you, and will soon utterly destroy thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But thus shall ye do to them; ye shall destroy
  their altars, and shall break down their pillars, and shall cut down their
  groves, and shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For thou art a holy people to the Lord
  thy God; and the Lord thy God chose thee to be to him a peculiar people
  beyond all nations that are upon the face of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> It was not because ye are more numerous than all
  other nations that the Lord preferred you, and the Lord made choice of you:
  for ye are fewer in number than all other nations. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But because the Lord loved you, and as keeping the
  oath which he sware to your fathers, the Lord brought you out with a strong
  hand, and the Lord redeemed thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand
  of Pharao king of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thou shalt
  know therefore, that the Lord thy God, he is God, a faithful God, who keeps
  covenant and mercy for them that love him, and for those that keep his
  commandments to a thousand generations, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and who recompenses them that hate him to their
  face, to destroy them utterly; and will not be slack with them that hate him:
  he will recompense them to their face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou shalt keep therefore the commands, and the
  ordinances, and these judgments, which I command thee this day to do.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And it shall come to pass when ye
  shall have heard these ordinances, and shall have kept and done them, that
  the Lord thy God shall keep for thee the covenant and the mercy, which he
  sware to your fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And he will
  love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the
  off-spring of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine,
  and thine oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, on the
  land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou shalt be blessed beyond all nations; there
  shall not be among you an impotent or barren one, or among thy cattle.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord thy God shall remove
  from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou
  hast seen, and all that thou hast known, will he lay upon thee; but he will
  lay them upon all that hate thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  thou shalt eat all the spoils of the nations which the Lord thy God gives
  thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods;
  for this is an offence to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But
  if thou shouldest say in thine heart, This nation is greater than I, how
  shall I be able to destroy them utterly? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> thou shalt not fear them; thou shalt surely
  remember all that the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> the great temptations which thine
  eyes have seen, those signs and great wonders, the strong hand, and the high
  arm; how the Lord thy God brought thee forth: so the Lord your God will do to
  all the nations, whom thou fearest in their presence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the Lord thy God shall send against them the
  hornets, until they that are left and they that are hidden from thee be
  utterly destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou shalt not be
  wounded before them, because the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is a great
  and powerful God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the Lord thy
  God shall consume these nations before thee by little and little: thou shalt
  not be able to consume them speedily, lest the land become desert, and the
  wild beasts of the field be multiplied against thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy
  hands, and thou shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until ye shall
  have utterly destroyed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he
  shall deliver their kings into your hands, and ye shall destroy their name
  from that place; none shall stand up in opposition before thee, until thou
  shalt have utterly destroyed them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Ye
  shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods: thou shalt not covet
  their silver, neither shalt thou take to thyself gold from them, lest thou
  shouldest offend thereby, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thou shalt not bring an
  abomination into thine house, so shouldest thou be an accursed thing like it;
  thou shalt utterly hate it, and altogether abominate it, because it is an
  accursed thing.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Ye shall
  observe to do all the commands which I charge you to-day, that ye may live
  and be multiplied, and enter in and inherit the land, which the Lord your God
  sware to give to your fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the
  wilderness, that he might afflict thee, and try thee, and that the things in
  thine heart might be made manifest, whether thou wouldest keep his
  commandments or no. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he afflicted
  thee and straitened thee with hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thy
  fathers knew not; that he might teach thee that man shall not live by bread
  alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man
  live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thy garments grew not old from
  off thee, thy shoes were not worn from off thee, thy feet were not painfully
  hardened, lo! these forty years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And
  thou shalt know in thine heart, that as if any man should chasten his son, so
  the Lord thy God will chasten thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And thou shalt keep the commands of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways,
  and to fear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the Lord thy God
  will bring thee into a good and extensive land, where there are torrents of
  waters, and fountains of deep places issuing through the plains and through
  the mountains: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> a land of wheat and
  barley, wherein are vines, figs, pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> a land on which thou shalt not eat thy
  bread with poverty, and thou shalt not want any thing upon it; a land whose
  stones are iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt dig brass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt eat and be filled, and shalt bless
  the Lord thy God on the good land, which he has given thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Take heed to thyself that thou forget not the
  Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commands, and his judgments, and
  ordinances, which I command thee this day: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast
  built goodly houses, and dwelt in them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and thy oxen and thy sheep are multiplied to
  thee, and thy silver and thy gold are multiplied to thee, and all thy
  possessions are multiplied to thee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  thou shouldest be exalted in heart, and forget the Lord thy God, who brought
  thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> who brought thee through that great and terrible
  wilderness, where is the biting serpent, and scorpion, and drought, where
  there was no water; who brought thee a fountain of water out of the flinty
  rock: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> who fed thee with manna in the
  wilderness, which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; that he might
  afflict thee, and thoroughly try thee, and do thee good in thy latter days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Lest thou shouldest say in thine
  heart, My strength, and the power of mine hand have wrought for me this great
  wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But thou shalt remember the
  Lord thy God, that he gives thee strength to get wealth; even that he may
  establish his covenant, which the Lord sware to thy fathers, as at this day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And it shall come to pass if thou do
  at all forget the Lord thy God, and shouldest go after other gods, and serve
  them, and worship them, I call heaven and earth to witness against you this
  day, that ye shall surely perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As
  also the other nations which the Lord God destroys before your face, so shall
  ye perish, because ye hearkened not to the voice of the Lord your God.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hear, O
  Israel: Thou goest this day across Jordan to inherit nations greater and
  stronger than yourselves, cities great and walled up to heaven; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> a people great and many and tall, the sons of
  Enac, whom thou knowest, and concerning whom thou hast heard say, Who can
  stand before the children of Enac? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  thou shalt know to-day, that the Lord thy God he shall go before thy face: he
  is a consuming fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall turn them back
  before thee, and shall destroy them quickly, as the Lord said to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Speak not in thine heart, when the
  Lord thy God has destroyed these nations before thy face, saying, For my
  righteousness the Lord brought me in to inherit this good land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Not for thy righteousness, nor for the holiness of
  thy heart, dost thou go in to inherit their land, but because of the
  wickedness of these nations the Lord will destroy them from before thee, and
  that he may establish the covenant, which the Lord sware to our fathers, to
  Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And thou shalt know to-day, that it is not for thy righteousnesses the Lord
  thy God gives thee this good land to inherit, for thou art a stiff-necked
  people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember, forget not, how much
  thou provokedst the Lord thy God in the wilderness: from the day that ye came
  forth out of Egypt, even till ye came into this place, ye continued to be
  disobedient toward the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Also in
  Choreb ye provoked the Lord, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> when I went up into the mountain to
  receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made
  with you, and I was in the mountain forty days and forty nights, I ate no
  bread and drank no water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the
  Lord gave me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on
  them there had been written all the words which the Lord spoke to you in the
  mountain in the day of the assembly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the
  two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly
  from hence, for thy people whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have
  transgressed; they have gone aside quickly out of the way which I commanded
  them, and have made themselves a molten image. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken
  to thee once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a
  stiff-necked people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And now suffer
  me utterly to destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven,
  and will make of thee a nation great and strong, and more numerous than this.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I turned and went down from the
  mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to heaven; and the two tables of
  the testimonies were in my two hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And when I saw that ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to
  yourselves a molten image, and had gone astray out of the way, which the Lord
  commanded you to keep; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> then I took
  hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them
  before you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I made my petition
  before the Lord as also at the first forty days and forty nights: I ate no
  bread and drank no water, on account of all your sins which ye sinned in
  doing evil before the Lord God to provoke him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And I was greatly terrified because of the wrath
  and anger, because the Lord was provoked with you utterly to destroy you; yet
  the Lord hearkened to me at this time also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he was angry with Aaron to destroy him
  utterly, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And your sin which ye had made, even the calf, I
  took, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it and ground it down till it
  became fine; and it became like dust, and I cast the dust into the brook that
  descended from the mountain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Also in
  the burning, and in the temptation, and at the graves of lust, ye provoked
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And when the Lord sent you
  forth from Cades Barne, saying, Go up and inherit the land which I give to
  you, then ye disobeyed the word of the Lord your God, and believed him not,
  and hearkened not to his voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Ye
  were disobedient in the things relating to the Lord from the day in which he
  became known to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And I prayed
  before the Lord forty days and forty nights, the number that I prayed before,
  for the Lord said that he would utterly destroy you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And I prayed to God, and said, O Lord, King of
  gods, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou didst redeem,
  whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great power, and with
  thy strong hand, and with thy high arm. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Remember Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob thy
  servants, to whom thou swarest by thyself: look not upon the hardness of
  heart of this people, and their impieties, and their sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Lest the inhabitants of the land whence thou
  broughtest us out speak, saying, Because the Lord could not bring them into
  the land of which he spoke to them, and because he hated them, has he brought
  them forth to slay them in the wilderness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And these are thy people and thy portion, whom
  thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great strength, and with
  thy mighty hand, and with thy high arm.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> At that
  time the Lord said to me, Hew for thyself two stone tables as the first, and
  come up to me into the mountain, and thou shalt make for thyself an ark of
  wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou shalt write upon the
  tables the words which were on the first tables which thou didst break, and
  thou shalt put them into the ark. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So I
  made an ark of boards of incorruptible wood, and I hewed tables of stone like
  the first, and I went up to the mountain, and the two tables were in my hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And he wrote upon the tables according
  to the first writing the ten commandments, which the Lord spoke to you in the
  mountain out of the midst of the fire, and the Lord gave them to me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I turned and came down from the
  mountain, and I put the tables into the ark which I had made; and there they
  were, as the Lord commanded me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And
  the children of Israel departed from Beeroth of the sons of Jakim to Misadai:
  there Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son was priest in
  his stead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Thence they departed to
  Gadgad; and from Gadgad to Etebatha, a land wherein are torrents of water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> At that time the Lord separated the
  tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand near
  before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name to this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Therefore the Levites have no part nor inheritance
  among their brethren; the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he said to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I remained in the mount
  forty days and forty nights: and the Lord heard me at that time also, and the
  Lord would not destroy you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the
  Lord said to me, Go, set out before this people, and let them go in and
  inherit the land, which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And now, Israel, what does the Lord
  thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his
  ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
  with all thy soul; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> to keep the
  commandments of the Lord thy God, and his ordinances, all that I charge thee
  to-day, that it may be well with thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens
  belong to the Lord thy God, the earth and all things that are in it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Only the Lord chose your fathers to
  love them, and he chose out their seed after them, even you, beyond all
  nations, as at this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Therefore ye
  shall circumcise the hardness of your heart, and ye shall not harden your
  neck. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the Lord your God, he is
  God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great, and strong, and terrible God,
  who does not accept persons, nor will he by any means accept a bribe:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> executing judgment for the stranger
  and orphan and widow, and he loves the stranger to give him food and raiment.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And ye shall love the stranger; for
  ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him,
  and shalt cleave to him, and shalt swear by his name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He is thy boast, and he is thy God, who has
  wrought in the midst of thee these great and glorious things, which thine
  eyes have seen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> With seventy souls
  your fathers went down into Egypt; but the Lord thy God has made thee as the
  stars of heaven in multitude.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and shalt observe his
  appointments, and his ordinances, and his commandments, and his judgments,
  always. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And ye shall know this day;
  for I speak not to your children, who know not and have not seen the
  discipline of the Lord thy God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand,
  and his high arm, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and his miracles,
  and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharao king of
  Egypt, and all his land; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and what he
  did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry,
  and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of
  them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and all the things which he did to you
  in the wilderness until ye came into this place; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and all the things that he did to Dathan and
  Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth
  swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that
  was with them, in the midst of all Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of
  the Lord, which he wrought among you to-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as
  I command thee to-day, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may
  go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that ye may live long upon the land,
  which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after
  them, a land flowing with milk and honey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For the land into which thou goest to inherit it,
  is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the
  seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> but the land into which thou goest to inherit it,
  is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> A land which the Lord thy God
  surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the
  beginning of the year to the end of the year. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now if ye will indeed hearken to all the commands
  which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with
  all thy heart, and with all thy soul, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  then he shall give to thy land the early and latter rain in its season, and
  thou shalt bring in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he shall give food in thy fields to thy
  cattle; and when thou hast eaten and art full, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> take heed to thyself that thy heart be not puffed
  up, and ye transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the
  heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit,
  and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And ye shall store these words
  in your heart and in your soul, and ye shall bind them as a sign on your
  hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And ye shall teach them to your children, so as
  to speak about them when thou sittest in the house, and when thou walkest by
  the way, and when thou sleepest, and when thou risest up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And ye shall write them on the lintels of your
  houses, and on your gates; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that your
  days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord
  sware to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And it shall come to pass that if ye
  will indeed hearken to all these commands, which I charge thee to observe
  this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to
  cleave close to him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> then the Lord
  shall cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall inherit great
  nations and stronger than yourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be your; from the
  wilderness and Antilibanus, and from the great river, the river Euphrates,
  even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your
  God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the
  land, on which ye shall tread, as he told you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Behold, I set before you this day the blessing
  and the curse; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> the blessing, if ye
  hearken to the commands of the Lord your God, all that I command you this
  day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and the curse, if ye do not
  hearken to the commands of the Lord our God, as many as I command you this
  day, and ye wander from the way which I have commanded you, having gone to
  serve other gods, which ye know not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into
  the land into which thou goest over to inherit it, then thou shalt put
  blessing on mount Garizin, and the curse upon mount Gaebal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Lo! are not these beyond Jordan, behind, westward
  in the land of Chanaan, which lies westward near Golgol, by the high oak?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For ye are passing over Jordan, to go
  in and inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives you to inherit always,
  and ye shall dwell in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And ye
  shall take heed to do all his ordinances, and these judgments, as many as I
  set before you to-day.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And
  these are the ordinances and the judgments, which ye shall observe to do in
  the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you for an inheritance,
  all the days which ye live upon the land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which
  they served their gods, whose land ye inherit, on the high mountains and on
  the hills, and under the thick tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And ye shall destroy their altars, and break in pieces their pillars, and ye
  shall cut down their groves, and ye shall burn with fire the graven images of
  their gods, and ye shall abolish their name out of that place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But in the place which the Lord thy
  God shall choose in one of your cities to name his name there, and to be
  called upon, ye shall even seek him out and go thither. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And ye shall carry thither your
  whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your first-fruits, and your
  vowed-offerings, and your freewill-offerings, and your offerings of
  thanksgiving, the first-born of your herds, and of your flocks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And ye shall eat there before the Lord your God,
  and ye shall rejoice in all the things on which ye shall lay your hand, ye
  and your houses, as the Lord your God has blessed you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Ye shall not do altogether as we do here to-day,
  every man that which is pleasing in his own sight. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For hitherto ye have not arrived at the rest and
  the inheritance, which the Lord our God gives you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And ye shall go over Jordan, and shall dwell in
  the land, which the Lord our God takes as an inheritance for you; and he
  shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye shall dwell
  safely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And there shall be a place
  which the Lord thy God shall choose for his name to be called there, thither
  shall ye bring all things that I order you to-day; your
  whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the
  first-fruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatsoever ye
  shall vow to the Lord your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye and your sons, and your
  daughters, and your men-servants and your maid-servants, and the Levite that
  is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Take heed to thyself that thou offer
  not thy whole-burnt-offerings in any place which thou shalt see; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> save in the place which the Lord thy God shall
  choose, in one of thy tribes, there shall ye offer your
  whole-burnt-offerings, and there shalt thou do all things whatsoever I charge
  thee this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But thou shalt kill
  according to all thy desire, and shalt eat flesh according to the blessing of
  the Lord thy God, which he has given thee in every city; the unclean that is
  within thee and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the
  stag. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Only ye shall not eat the
  blood; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy cities the
  tithe of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thine
  herd and of thy flock, and all your vows as many as ye shall have vowed, and
  your thank-offerings, and the first-fruits of thine hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But before the Lord thy God thou shalt eat it, in
  the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, thou, and thy son,
  and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the stranger
  that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, on
  whatsoever thou shalt lay thine hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Take heed to thyself that thou do not desert the Levite all the time that
  thou livest upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And if
  the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, as he said to thee, and thou
  shalt say, I will eat flesh; if thy soul should desire to eat flesh, thou
  shalt eat flesh according to all the desire of thy soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if the place be far from thee, which the Lord
  thy God shall choose for himself, that his name be called upon it, then thou
  shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which God shall have given thee, even
  as I commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy cities according to the desire
  of thy soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> As the doe and the stag
  are eaten, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat
  it in like manner. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Take diligent heed
  that thou eat no blood, for blood is the life of it; the life shall not be
  eaten with the flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Ye shall not
  eat it; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with
  thee and with thy sons after thee, if thou shalt do that which is good and
  pleasing before the Lord thy God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But
  thou shalt take thy holy things, if thou hast any, and thy vowed-offerings,
  and come to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name
  named upon it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And thou shalt
  sacrifice thy whole-burnt-offerings, thou shalt offer the flesh upon the
  altar of the Lord thy God; but the blood of thy sacrifices thou shalt pour
  out at the foot of the altar of the Lord thy God, but the flesh thou shalt
  eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Beware and hearken, and thou
  shalt do all the commands which I charge thee, that it may be well with thee
  and with thy sons for ever, if thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good
  before the Lord thy God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if the
  Lord thy God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom thou goest in thither
  to inherit their land, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit it, and dwell
  in their land; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> take heed to thyself
  that thou seek not to follow them after they are destroyed before thee,
  saying, How do these nations act towards their gods? I will do likewise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thou shalt not do so to thy God; for
  they have sacrificed to their gods the abominations of the Lord which he
  hates, for they burn their sons and their daughters in fire to their gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Every word that I command you this
  day, it shalt thou observe to do: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from
  it.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy13">13</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And if
  there arise within thee a prophet, or one who dreams a dream, and he gives
  thee a sign or a wonder, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and the sign
  or the wonder come to pass which he spoke to thee, saying, Let us go and
  serve other gods, which ye know not; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  ye shall not hearken to the words of that prophet, or the dreamer of that
  dream, because the Lord thy God tries you, to know whether ye love your God
  with all your heart and with all your soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Ye shall follow the Lord your God, and fear him,
  and ye shall hear his voice, and attach yourselves to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And that prophet or that dreamer of a dream, shall
  die; for he has spoken to make thee err from the Lord thy God who brought
  thee out of the land of Egypt, who redeemed thee from bondage, to thrust thee
  out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in: so shalt
  thou abolish the evil from among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  And if thy brother by thy father or mother, or thy son, or daughter, or thy
  wife in thy bosom, or friend who is equal to thine own soul, entreat thee
  secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy
  fathers have known, <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> of the gods of the
  nations that are round about you, who are near thee or at a distance from
  thee, from one end of the earth to the other; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> thou shalt not consent to him, neither shalt thou
  hearken to him; and thine eye shall not spare him, thou shalt feel no regret
  for him, neither shalt thou at all protect him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> thou shalt surely report concerning him, and thy
  hands shall be upon him among the first to slay him, and the hands of all the
  people at the last. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they shall
  stone him with stones, and he shall die, because he sought to draw thee away
  from the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
  house of bondage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all Israel
  shall hear, and fear, and shall not again do according to this evil thing
  among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And if in one of thy
  cities which the Lord God gives thee to dwell therein, thou shalt hear men
  saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Evil men have gone out from
  you, and have caused all the inhabitants of their land to fall away, saying,
  Let us go and worship other gods, whom ye knew not, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> then thou shalt enquire and ask, and search
  diligently, and behold, if the thing is clearly true, and this abomination
  has taken place among you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> thou shalt
  utterly destroy all the dwellers in that land with the edge of the sword; ye
  shall solemnly curse it, and all things in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And all its spoils thou shalt gather into its
  public ways, and thou shalt burn the city with fire, and all its spoils
  publicly before the Lord thy God; and it shall be uninhabited for ever, it
  shall not be built again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And there
  shall nothing of the cursed thing cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may turn
  from his fierce anger, and shew thee mercy, and pity thee, and multiply thee,
  as he sware to thy fathers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> if thou
  wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, all that I
  charge thee this day, to do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord
  thy God.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy14">14</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Ye are
  the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not make any baldness between you
  eyes for the dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For thou art a holy
  people to the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a
  peculiar people to himself of all the nations on the face of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ye shall not eat any abominable thing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> These are the beasts which ye shall
  eat; the calf of the herd, and lamb of the sheep, and kid of the goats;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> the stag, and doe, and pygarg, and
  wild goat, and camelopard. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Every beast
  that divides the hoofs, and makes claws of two divisions, and that chews the
  cud among beasts, these ye shall eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, and of those that
  divide the hoofs, and make distinct claws; the camel, and the hare, and the
  rabbit; because they chew the cud, and do not divide the hoof, these are
  unclean to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And as for the swine,
  because he divides the hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, yet he chews not
  the cud, he is unclean to you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, ye shall not
  touch their dead bodies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And these ye
  shall eat of all that are in the water, ye shall eat all that have fins and
  scales. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And all that have not fins
  and scales ye shall not eat; they are unclean to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Ye shall eat every clean bird. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And these of them ye shall not eat; the eagle,
  and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  and the vulture, and the kite and the like to it, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and the
  sparrow, and the owl, and the seamew, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  and the heron, and the swan, and the stork, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and the cormorant, and the hawk, and its like,
  and the hoopoe, and the raven, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and
  the pelican, and the diver and the like to it, and the red-bill and the bat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> All winged animals that creep are
  unclean to you; ye shall not eat of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Ye shall eat every clean bird. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Ye shall eat nothing that dies of itself; it
  shall be given to the sojourner in thy cities and he shall eat it, or thou
  shalt sell it to a stranger, because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy
  God. Thou shalt not boil a lamb in his mother’s milk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou shalt tithe a tenth of all the produce of
  thy seed, the fruit of thy field year by year. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And thou shalt eat it in the place which the Lord
  thy God shall choose to have his name called there; ye shall bring the tithe
  of thy corn and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thy herd and
  of thy flock, that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And if the journey be too far for
  thee, and thou art not able to bring them, because the place is far from thee
  which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there, because
  the Lord thy God will bless thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  then thou shalt sell them for money, and thou shalt take the money in thy
  hands, and thou shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thou shalt give the money for
  whatsoever thy soul shall desire, for oxen or for sheep, or for wine, or thou
  shalt lay it out on strong drink, or on whatsoever thy soul may desire, and
  thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice and thy
  house, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and the Levite that is in thy
  cities, because he has not a portion or inheritance with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> After three years thou shalt bring out all the
  tithes of thy fruits, in that year thou shalt lay it up in thy cities.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the Levite shall come, because he
  has no part or lot with thee, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow
  which is in thy cities; and they shall eat and be filled, that the Lord thy
  God may bless thee in all the works which thou shalt do.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy15">15</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Every
  seven years thou shalt make a release. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And this is the ordinance of the release: thou shalt remit every private debt
  which thy neighbour owes thee, and thou shalt not ask payment of it from thy
  brother; for it has been called a release to the Lord thy God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Of a stranger thou shalt ask again whatsoever he
  has of thine, but to thy brother thou shalt remit his debt to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For thus there shall not be a poor
  person in the midst of thee, for the Lord thy God will surely bless thee in
  the land which the Lord thy God gives thee by inheritance, that thou
  shouldest inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And if ye shall
  indeed hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep and do all these
  commandments, as many as I charge thee this day, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> (for the Lord thy God has blessed thee in the way
  of which he spoke to thee,)then thou shalt lend to many nations, but thou
  shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not
  rule over thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if there shall be
  in the midst of thee a poor man of thy brethren in one of thy cities in the
  land, which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart,
  neither shalt thou by any means close up thine hand from thy brother who is
  in want. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thou shalt surely open thine
  hands to him, and shalt lend to him as much as he wants according to his
  need. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Take heed to thyself that there
  be not a secret thing in thine heart, an iniquity, saying, The seventh year,
  the year of release, draws nigh; and thine eye shall be evil to thy brother
  that is in want, and thou shalt not give to him, and he shall cry against
  thee to the Lord, and there shall be great sin in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou shalt surely give to him, and thou shalt
  lend him as much as he wants, according as he is in need; and thou shalt not
  grudge in thine heart as thou givest to him, because on this account the Lord
  thy God will bless thee in all thy works, and in all things on which thou
  shalt lay thine hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the poor
  shall not fail off thy land, therefore I charge thee to do this thing,
  saying, Thou shalt surely open thine hands to thy poor brother, and to him
  that is distressed upon thy land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  if thy brother or sister, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, be sold to thee, he
  shall serve thee six years, and in the seventh year thou shalt send him out
  free from thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And when thou shalt
  send him out free from thee, thou shalt not send him out empty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou shalt give him provision for the way from
  thy flock, and from thy corn, and from thy wine; as the Lord thy God has
  blessed thee, thou shalt give to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
  the Lord thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I charge thee to do
  this thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if he should say to
  thee, I will not go out from thee, because he continues to love thee and thy
  house, because he is well with thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  then thou shalt take an awl, and bore his ear through to the door, and he
  shall be thy servant for ever; and in like manner shalt thou do to thy
  maid-servant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> It shall not seem hard
  to thee when they are sent out free from thee, because thy servant has served
  thee six years according to the annual hire of a hireling; so the Lord thy
  God shall bless thee in all things whatsoever thou mayest do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Every first-born that shall be born among thy
  kine and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify the males to the Lord thy God; thou
  shalt not work with thy first-born calf, and thou shalt not shear the
  first-born of thy sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou shalt
  eat it before the Lord year by year in the place which the Lord thy God shall
  choose, thou and thy house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And if
  there be in it a blemish, if it be lame or blind, an evil blemish, thou shalt
  not sacrifice it to the Lord thy God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Thou shalt eat it in thy cities; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat
  it in like manner, as the doe or the stag. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour
  it out on the earth as water.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy16">16</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Observe
  the month of new corn, and thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy
  God; because in the month of new corn thou camest out of Egypt by night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And thou shalt sacrifice the passover
  to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen in the place which the Lord thy God shall
  choose to have his name called upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Thou shalt not eat leaven with it; seven days
  shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, bread of affliction, because ye came
  forth out of Egypt in haste; that ye may remember the day of your coming
  forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy
  borders for seven days, and there shall not be left of the flesh which thou
  shalt sacrifice at even on the first day until the morning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> thou shalt not have power to sacrifice the
  passover in any of the cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But in the place which the Lord thy
  God shall choose, to have his name called there, thou shalt sacrifice the
  passover at even at the setting of the sun, at the time when thou camest out
  of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And thou shalt boil and
  roast and eat it in the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and thou
  shalt return in the morning, and go to thy house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on
  the seventh day is a holiday, a feast to the Lord thy God: thou shalt not do
  in it any work, save what must be done by any one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Seven weeks shalt thou number to thyself; when
  thou hast begun to put the sickle to the corn, thou shalt begin to number
  seven weeks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt keep the
  feast of weeks to the Lord thy God, accordingly as thy hand has power in as
  many things as the Lord thy God shall give thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God,
  thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, and
  the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which dwells
  among you, in whatsoever place the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name
  should be called there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thou
  shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and thou shalt
  observe and do these commands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou
  shalt keep for thyself the feast of tabernacles seven days, when thou
  gatherest in thy produce from thy corn-floor and thy wine-press. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and
  thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the
  Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow that is in thy
  cities. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Seven days shalt thou keep a
  feast to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose
  for himself; and if the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy fruits, and
  in every work of thy hands, then thou shalt rejoice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Three times in the year shall all thy males
  appear before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose in
  the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of
  tabernacles: thou shalt not appear before the Lord thy God empty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Each one according to his ability,
  according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he has given thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thou shalt make for thyself judges
  and officers in thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee in thy tribes,
  and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> they shall not wrest judgment, nor favour
  persons, nor receive a gift; for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and
  pervert the words of the righteous. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Thou shalt justly pursue justice, that ye may live, and go in and inherit the
  land which the Lord thy God gives thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou shalt not plant for thyself a grove; thou
  shalt not plant for thyself any tree near the altar of thy God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou shalt not set up for thyself a pillar, which
  the Lord thy God hates.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy17">17</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thou
  shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a calf or a sheep, in which there is
  a blemish, or any evil thing; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And if there should be found in any
  one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee, a man or a woman who
  shall do that which is evil before the Lord thy God, so as to transgress his
  covenant, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and they should go and serve
  other gods, and worship them, the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of
  heaven, which he commanded thee not to do, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and it be told thee, and thou shalt have enquired
  diligently, and, behold, the thing really took place, this abomination has
  been done in Israel; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> then shalt thou
  bring out that man, or that woman, and ye shall stone them with stones, and
  they shall die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He shall die on the
  testimony of two or three witnesses; a man who is put to death shall not be
  put to death for one witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the
  hand of the witnesses shall be upon him among the first to put him to death,
  and the hand of the people at the last; so shalt thou remove the evil one
  from among yourselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if a matter
  shall be too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, and between
  cause and cause, and between stroke and stroke, and between contradiction and
  contradiction, matters of judgment in your cities; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then thou shalt arise and go up to the place which
  the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come to the priests the
  Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days, and they shall search
  out the matter and report the judgment to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And thou shalt act according to the thing which
  they shall report to thee out of the place which the Lord thy God shall
  choose, and thou shalt observe to do all whatsoever shall have been by law
  appointed to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou shalt do
  according to the law and to the judgment which they shall declare to thee:
  thou shalt not swerve to the right hand or to the left from any sentence
  which they shall report to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  the man whosoever shall act in haughtiness, so as not to hearken to the
  priest who stands to minister in the name of the Lord thy God, or the judge
  who shall preside in those days, that man shall die, and thou shalt remove
  the evil one out of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And all
  the people shall hear and fear, and shall no more commit impiety.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And when thou shalt enter into the
  land which the Lord thy God gives thee, and shalt inherit it and dwell in it,
  and shalt say, I will set a ruler over me, as also the other nations round
  about me; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> thou shalt surely set over
  thee the ruler whom the Lord God shall choose: of thy brethren thou shalt set
  over thee a ruler; thou shalt not have power to set over thee a stranger,
  because he is not thy brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For he
  shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall by no means turn the
  people back to Egypt, lest he should multiply to himself horses; for the Lord
  said, Ye shall not any more turn back by that way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he shall not multiply to himself wives, lest
  his heart turn away; and he shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and
  gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And when he shall be
  established in his government, then shall he write for himself this
  repetition of the law into a book by the hands of the priests the Levites;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and it shall be with him, and he
  shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord
  thy God, and to keep all these commandments, and to observe these ordinances:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> that his heart be not lifted up above
  his brethren, that he depart not from the commandments on the right hand or
  on the left; that he and his sons may reign long in his dominion among the
  children of Israel.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy18">18</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The
  priests, the Levites, even the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor
  inheritance with Israel; the burnt-offerings of the Lord are their
  inheritance, they shall eat them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself is his
  portion, as he said to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And this
  is the due of the priests in the things coming from the people from those who
  offer sacrifices, whether it be a calf or a sheep; and thou shalt give the
  shoulder to the priest, and the cheeks, and the great intestine: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and the first-fruits of thy corn, and of thy wine,
  and of thine oil; and thou shalt give to him the first-fruits of the fleeces
  of thy sheep: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because the Lord has
  chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand before the Lord thy God, to
  minister and bless in his name, himself and his sons among the children of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And if a Levite come from one
  of the cities of all the children of Israel, where he himself dwells,
  accordingly as his mind desires, to the place which he shall have chosen,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> he shall minister to the name of the
  Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites, who stand there present before
  the Lord thy God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He shall eat an
  allotted portion, besides the sale of his hereditary property. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And when thou shalt have entered into the land
  which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to
  the abominations of those nations. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  There shall not be found in thee one who purges his son or his daughter with
  fire, one who uses divination, who deals with omens, and augury, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> a sorcerer employing incantation, one who has in
  him a divining spirit, and observer of signs, questioning the dead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For every one that does these things
  is an abomination to the Lord thy God; for because of these abominations the
  Lord will destroy them from before thy face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For all these nations whose land thou
  shalt inherit, they will listen to omens and divinations; but the Lord thy
  God has not permitted thee so to do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  The Lord thy God shall raise up to thee a prophet of thy brethren, like me;
  him shall ye hear: <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> according to all
  things which thou didst desire of the Lord thy God in Choreb in the day of
  the assembly, saying, We will not again hear the voice of the Lord thy God,
  and we will not any more see this great fire, and so we shall not die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the Lord said to me, They have
  spoken rightly all that they have said to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I will raise up to them a prophet of their
  brethren, like thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak
  to them as I shall command him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  whatever man shall not hearken to whatsoever words that prophet shall speak
  in my name, I will take vengeance on him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But the prophet whosoever shall impiously speak
  in my name a word which I have not commanded him to speak, and whosoever
  shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But if thou shalt say in thine heart, How shall
  we know the word which the Lord has not spoken? <span style=

  <h3 id="deuteronomy19">19</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And when
  the Lord thy God shall have destroyed the nations, which God gives thee, even
  the land, and ye shall inherit them, and dwell in their cities, and in their
  houses, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> thou shalt separate for
  thyself three cities in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God gives
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Take a survey of thy way, and
  thou shalt divide the coasts of thy land, which the Lord thy God apportions
  to thee, into three parts, and there shall be there a refuge for every
  manslayer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And this shall be the
  ordinance of the manslayer, who shall flee thither, and shall live, whosoever
  shall have smitten his neighbour ignorantly, whereas he hated him not in
  times past. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And whosoever shall enter
  with his neighbour into the thicket, to gather wood, if the hand of him that
  cuts wood with the axe should be violently shaken, and the axe head falling
  off from the handle should light on his neighbour, and he should die, he
  shall flee to one of these cities, and live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Lest the avenger of blood pursue after the slayer,
  because his heart is hot, and overtake him, if the way be too long, and slay
  him, though there is to this man no sentence of death, because he hated him
  not in time past. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Therefore I charge
  thee, saying, Thou shalt separate for thy self three cities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if the Lord shall enlarge thy borders, as he
  sware to thy fathers, and the Lord shall give to thee all the land which he
  said he would give to thy fathers; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> if
  thou shalt hearken to do all these commands, which I charge thee this day, to
  love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways continually; thou shalt add
  for thyself yet three cities to these three. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> So innocent blood shall not be spilt in the land,
  which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, and there shall not be in thee
  one guilty of blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But if there
  should be in thee a man hating his neighbour, and he should lay wait for him,
  and rise up against him, and smite him, that he die, and he should flee to
  one of these cities, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> then shall the
  elders of his city send, and take him thence, and they shall deliver him into
  the hands of the avengers of blood, and he shall die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thine eye shall not spare him; so shalt thou
  purge innocent blood from Israel, and it shall be well with thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou shalt not move the landmarks of
  thy neighbour, which thy fathers set in the inheritance, in which thou hast
  obtained a share in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit.

  which he may commit; by the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three

  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if an unjust witness rise up against a man,
  alleging iniquity against him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> then
  shall the two men between whom the controversy is, stand before the Lord, and
  before the priests, and before the judges, who may be in those days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the judges shall make diligent
  inquiry, and, behold, if and unjust witness has borne unjust testimony; and
  has stood up against his brother; <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  then shall ye do to him as he wickedly devised to do against his brother, and
  thou shalt remove the evil from yourselves. <span style=

  according to this evil thing in the midst of you. <span style=

  the land of Egypt. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And it shall come
  to pass whenever thou shalt draw nigh to battle, that the priest shall draw
  nigh and speak to the people, and shall say to them, <span style=

  against your enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, neither be
  confounded, neither turn aside from their face. <span style=

  What man is he that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him

  a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he
  die in the battle, and another man take her. <span style=

  and say, What man is he that fears and is cowardly in his heart? Let him go
  and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother fail, as his
  own. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And it shall come to pass when
  the scribes shall have ceased speaking to the people, that they shall appoint
  generals of the army to be leaders of the people. <span style=

  them by war, then call them out peaceably. <span style=

  open to thee, it shall be that all the people found in it shall be tributary

  not hearken to thee, but wage war against thee, thou shalt invest it;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> until the Lord thy God shall deliver
  it into thy hands, and thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the
  sword: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> except the women and the
  stuff: and all the cattle, and whatsoever shall be in the city, and all the
  plunder thou shalt take as spoil for thyself, and shalt eat all the plunder
  of thine enemies whom the Lord thy God gives thee. <span style=

  Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the
  Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite; as the Lord thy God commanded
  thee: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> that they may not teach you to

  before the Lord your God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if thou
  shouldest besiege a city many days to prevail against it by war to take it,
  thou shalt not destroy its trees, by applying an iron tool to them, but thou
  shalt eat of it, and shalt not cut it down: Is the tree that is in the field
  a man, to enter before thee into the work of the siege? <span style=

  be charged on thy people Israel: and the blood shall be atoned for to them.

  her father and mother the days of a month; and afterwards thou shalt go in to
  her and dwell with her, and she shall be thy wife. <span style=

  thou shalt send her out free; and she shall not by any means be sold for
  money, thou shalt not treat her contemptuously, because thou hast humbled
  her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if a man have two wives, the

  take hold of him, and bring him forth to the elders of his city, and to the
  gate of the place: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and they shall say

  woman, and when I came to her I found not her tokens of virginity:

  tokens of virginity with thy daughter; and these are the tokens of my
  daughter’s virginity. And they shall unfold the garment before the elders of

  defile the house of her father by whoring: so thou shalt remove the evil one
  from among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And if a man be found
  lying with a woman married to a man, ye shall kill them both, the man that
  lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou remove the wicked one out of

  damsel espoused to a man, and a man should have found her in the city and
  have lain with her; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> ye shall bring

  thee; and it shall be mercy to thee before the Lord thy God. <span style=

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thou shalt pay him his wages the same
  day, the sun shall not go down upon it, because he is poor and he trusts in
  it; and he shall cry against thee to the Lord, and it shall be sin in thee.

  thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee
  from thence; therefore I charge thee to do this thing. <span style=

  the unrighteous should be worthy of stripes, thou shalt lay him down before
  the judges, and they shall scourge him before them according to his iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they shall scourge him with forty

  the man should not be willing to take his brother’s wife, then shall the
  woman go up to the gate to the elders, and she shall say, My husband’s
  brother will not raise up the name of his brother in Israel, my husband’s
  brother has refused. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the elders of
  his city shall call him, and speak to him; and if he stand and say, I will
  not take her: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> then his brother’s wife

  the Lord heard our voice, and saw our humiliation, and our labour, and our
  affliction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord brought us
  out of Egypt himself with his great strength, and his mighty hand, and his

  thee, thou and thy family, and the Levite, and the stranger that is within
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And when thou shalt have
  completed all the tithings of thy fruits in the third year, thou shalt give
  the second tenth to the Levite, and stranger, and fatherless, and widow; and
  they shall eat it in thy cities, and be merry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I

  all commands which thou didst command me: I did not transgress thy command,
  and I did not forget it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And in my
  distress I did not eat of them, I have not gathered of them for an unclean
  purpose, I have not given of them to the dead; I have hearkened to the voice

  the words of this law, which have been written in this book, to fear this
  glorious and wonderful name, the Lord thy God; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> then the Lord shall magnify thy plagues, and the
  plagues of thy seed, great and wonderful plagues, and evil and abiding
  diseases. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> And he shall bring upon
  thee all the evil pain of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid, and they shall
  cleave to thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And the Lord shall
  bring upon thee every sickness, and every plague that is not written, and
  every one that is written in the book of this law, until he shall have
  destroyed thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And ye shall be left
  few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of the sky in multitude; because
  thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(63)</span> And it shall come to pass that as the Lord
  rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the Lord will
  rejoice over you to destroy you; and ye shall be quickly removed from the
  land, into which ye go to inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span>
  And the Lord thy God shall scatter thee among all nations, from one end of
  the earth to the other; and thou shalt there serve other gods, wood and
  stone, which thou hast not known, nor thy fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> Moreover among those nations he will not give
  thee quiet, neither by any means shall the sole of thy foot have rest; and
  the Lord shall give thee there another and a misgiving heart, and failing
  eyes, and a wasting soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span> And thy
  life shall be in suspense before thine eyes; and thou shalt be afraid by day
  and by night, and thou shalt have no assurance of thy life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(67)</span> In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were
  evening! and in the evening thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the
  fear of thine heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sights of thine
  eyes which thou shalt see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> And the
  Lord shall bring thee back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I said,
  Thou shalt not see it again; and ye shall be sold there to your enemies for
  bondmen and bondwomen, and none shall buy you.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy29">29</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> These
  are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with
  the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he
  made with them in Choreb. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Moses
  called all the sons of Israel and said to them, Ye have seen all things that
  the Lord did in the land of Egypt before you to Pharao and his servants, and
  all his land; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> the great temptations
  which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yet the Lord God has not given you a heart to
  know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he led you forty years in the wilderness; your
  garments did not grow old, and your sandals were not worn away off your feet.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye did not eat bread, ye did not drink
  wine or strong drink, that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And ye came as far as this place; and
  there came forth Seon king of Esebon, and Og king of Basan, to meet us in
  war. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And we smote them and took their
  land, and I gave it for an inheritance to Ruben and Gad, and to the
  half-tribe of Manasse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And ye shall
  take heed to do all the words of this covenant, that ye may understand all
  things that ye shall do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Ye all stand
  to-day before the Lord your God, the heads of your tribes, and your elders,
  and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> your wives, and your children, and the stranger
  who is in the midst of your camp, from your hewer of wood even to your drawer
  of water, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> that thou shouldest enter
  into the covenant of the Lord thy God and into his oaths, as many as the Lord
  thy God appoints thee this day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> that
  he may appoint thee to himself for a people, and he shall be thy God, as he
  said to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And I do not appoint to you alone
  this covenant and this oath; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but to
  those also who are here with you to-day before the Lord your God, and to
  those who are not here with you to-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt,
  how we came through the midst of the nations through whom ye came.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And ye beheld their abominations, and
  their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Lest there be among you man, or
  woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart has turned aside from the Lord your
  God, having gone to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be in you a
  root springing up with gall and bitterness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And it shall be if one shall hear the words of
  this curse, and shall flatter himself in his heart, saying, Let good happen
  to me, for I will walk in the error of my heart, lest the sinner destroy the
  guiltless with him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> God shall by no
  means be willing to pardon him, but then the wrath of the Lord and his
  jealousy shall flame out against that man; and all the curses of this
  covenant shall attach themselves to him, which are written in this book, and
  the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And the Lord shall separate that man for evil of
  all the children of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that
  are written in the book of this law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And another generation shall say—even your sons who shall rise up after you,
  and the stranger who shall come from a land afar off, and shall see the
  plagues of that land and their diseases, which the Lord has sent upon it,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> brimstone and burning salt, (the
  whole land shall not be sown, neither shall any green thing spring, nor rise
  upon it, as Sodom and Gomorrha were overthrown, Adama and Seboim, which the
  Lord overthrew in his wrath and anger:)— <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and all the nations shall say, Why has the Lord
  done thus to this land? what is this great fierceness of anger? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And men shall say, Because they forsook the
  covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, the things which he appointed to
  their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and they went and served other gods, which they
  knew not, neither did he assign them to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the Lord was exceedingly angry with that land
  to bring upon it according to all the curses which are written in the book of
  this law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And the Lord removed them
  from their land in anger, and wrath, and very great indignation, and cast
  them out into another land as at present. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but
  the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, to do
  all the words of this law.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy30">30</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it
  shall come to pass when all these things shall have come upon thee, the
  blessing and the curse, which I have set before thy face, and thou shalt call
  them to mind among all the nations, wherein the Lord shall have scattered
  thee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and shalt return to the Lord thy
  God, and shalt hearken to his voice, according to all things which I charge
  thee this day, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> then the Lord shall heal thine iniquities, and
  shall pity thee, and shall again gather thee out from all the nations, among
  which the Lord has scattered thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If
  thy dispersion be from one end of heaven to the other, thence will the Lord
  thy God gather thee, and thence will the Lord thy God take thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord thy God shall bring thee in from
  thence into the land which thy fathers have inherited, and thou shalt inherit
  it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord shall purge thy heart,
  and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
  with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the Lord thy God will put these curses upon
  thine enemies, and upon those that hate thee, who have persecuted thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou shalt return and hearken to
  the voice of the Lord thy God, and shall keep his commands, all that I charge
  thee this day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the Lord thy God
  shall bless thee in every work of thine hands, in the offspring of thy body,
  and in the offspring of thy cattle, and in the fruits of thy land, because
  the Lord thy God will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over
  thy fathers: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> if thou wilt hearken to
  the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ordinances,
  and his judgments written in the book of this law, if thou turn to the Lord
  thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For this command which I give thee this day is
  not grievous, neither is it far from thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> It is not in heaven above, as if there were one
  saying, Who shall go up for us into heaven, and shall take it for us, and we
  will hear and do it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Neither is it
  beyond the sea, saying, Who will go over for us to the other side of the sea,
  and take it for us, and make it audible to us, and we will do it?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The word is very near thee, in thy
  mouth, and in thine heart, and in thine hands to do it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Behold, I have set before thee this day life and
  death, good and evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> If thou wilt
  hearken to the commands of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day,
  to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
  ordinances, and his judgments; then ye shall live, and shall be many in
  number, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all the land into which thou
  goest to inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But if thy heart
  change, and thou wilt not hearken, and thou shalt go astray and worship other
  gods, and serve them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I declare to
  you this day, that ye shall utterly perish, and ye shall by no means live
  long upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I call both heaven and earth to witness this day
  against you, I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the
  curse: choose thou life, that thou and thy seed may live; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to his
  voice, and cleave to him; for this is thy life, and the length of thy days,
  that thou shouldest dwell upon the land, which the Lord sware to thy fathers,
  Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy31">31</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And
  Moses finished speaking all these words to all the children of Israel;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and said to them, I am this day a
  hundred and twenty years old; I shall not be able any longer to come in or go
  out; and the Lord said to me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord thy God who goes before thee,
  he shall destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt inherit them: and
  it shall be Joshua that goes before thy face, as the Lord has spoken.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord thy God shall do to them
  as he did to Seon and Og the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
  Jordan, and to their land, as he destroyed them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the Lord has delivered them to you; and ye
  shall do to them, as I charged you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Be
  courageous and strong, fear not, neither be cowardly neither be afraid before
  them; for it is the Lord your God that advances with you in the midst of you,
  neither will he by any means forsake thee, nor desert thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Moses called Joshua, and said to him before
  all Israel, Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt go in before this people
  into the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and thou
  shalt give it to them for an inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord that goes with thee shall not forsake
  thee nor abandon thee; fear not, neither be afraid. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Moses wrote the words of this law in a book,
  and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who bear the ark of the covenant
  of the Lord, and to the elders of the sons of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Moses charged them in that day, saying, After
  seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> when all Israel come together to
  appear before the Lord your God, in the place which the Lord shall choose, ye
  shall read this law before all Israel in their ears, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> having assembled the people, the men, and the
  women, and the children, and the stranger that is in your cities, that they
  may hear, and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God; and they shall
  hearken to do all the words of this law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And their sons who have not known shall hear, and
  shall learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days that they live upon the
  land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, the days of
  thy death are at hand; call Joshua, and stand ye by the doors of the
  tabernacle of testimony, and I will give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua
  went to the tabernacle of testimony, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle
  of testimony. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the Lord descended
  in a cloud, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; and the
  pillar of the cloud stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, Behold,
  thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will arise and go a
  whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they are entering: and
  they will forsake me, and break my covenant, which I made with them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I will be very angry with them in
  that day, and I will leave them and turn my face away from them, and they
  shall be devoured; and many evils and afflictions shall come upon them; and
  they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these
  evils have come upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I will
  surely turn away my face from them in that day, because of all their evil
  doings which they have done, because they turned aside after strange gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And now write the words of this song,
  and teach it to the children of Israel, and ye shall put it into their mouth,
  that this song may witness for me among the children of Israel to their face.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For I will bring them into the good
  land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with
  milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy themselves; then
  will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke
  me, and break my covenant. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And this
  song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out
  of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their
  wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them
  into the good land, which I sware to their fathers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught
  it to the children of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he
  charged Joshua, and said, Be courageous and strong, for thou shalt bring the
  sons of Israel into the land, which the Lord sware to them, and he shall be
  with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And when Moses finished
  writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the end, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> then he charged the Levites who bear the ark of
  the covenant of the Lord, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Take the book of this law, and ye shall put it in the side of the ark of the
  covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there among you for a
  testimony. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For I know thy
  provocation, and thy stiff neck; for yet during my life with you at this day,
  ye have been provoking in your conduct toward God: how shall ye not also be
  so after my death? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Gather together to
  me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your
  officers, that I may speak in their ears all these words; and I call both
  heaven and earth to witness against them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For I know that after my death ye will utterly
  transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and
  evils shall come upon you in the latter days, because ye will do evil before
  the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands. And Moses spoke
  all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole
  assembly.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy32">32</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Attend,
  O heaven, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words out of my mouth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Let my speech be looked for as the
  rain, and my words come down as dew, as the shower upon the herbage, and as
  snow upon the grass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I have called
  on the name of the Lord: assign ye greatness to our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> As for God, his works are true, and all his ways
  are judgment: God is faithful, and there is no unrighteousness in him; just
  and holy is the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They have
  sinned, not pleasing him; spotted children, a froward and perverse
  generation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Do ye thus recompense the
  Lord? is the people thus foolish and unwise? did not he himself thy father
  purchase thee, and make thee, and form thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember the days of old, consider the years for
  past ages: ask thy father, and he shall relate to thee, thine elders, and
  they shall tell thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> When the Most
  High divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the
  bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And his people Jacob became the
  portion of the Lord, Israel was the line of his inheritance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He maintained him in the wilderness, in burning
  thirst and a dry land: he led him about and instructed him, and kept him as
  the apple of an eye. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> As an eagle
  would watch over his brood, and yearns over his young, receives them having
  spread his wings, and takes them up on his back: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> the Lord alone led them, there was no strange god
  with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> He brought them up on the
  strength of the land; he fed them with the fruits of the fields; they sucked
  honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with the fat
  of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with fat of kidneys of wheat; and he
  drank wine, the blood of the grape. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  So Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved one kicked; he grew fat, he
  became thick and broad: then he forsook the God that made him, and departed
  from God his Saviour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They provoked
  me to anger with strange gods; with their abominations they bitterly angered
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They sacrificed to devils, and
  not to God; to gods whom they knew not: new and fresh gods came in, whom
  their fathers knew not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thou hast
  forsaken God that begot thee, and forgotten God who feeds thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the Lord saw, and was jealous; and was
  provoked by the anger of his sons and daughters, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and said, I will turn away my face from them, and
  will show what shall happen to them in the last days; for it is a perverse
  generation, sons in whom is no faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  They have provoked me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have
  exasperated me with their idols; and I will provoke them to jealousy with
  them that are no nation, I will anger them with a nation void of
  understanding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For a fire has been
  kindled out of my wrath, it shall burn to hell below; it shall devour the
  land, and the fruits of it; it shall set on fire the foundations of the
  mountains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I will gather evils upon
  them, and will fight with my weapons against them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> They shall be consumed with hunger and the
  devouring of birds, and there shall be irremediable destruction: I will send
  forth against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the rage of serpents
  creeping on the ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Without, the
  sword shall bereave them of children, and terror shall issue out of the
  secret chambers; the young man shall perish with the virgin, the suckling
  with him who has grown old. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I said, I
  will scatter them, and I will cause their memorial to cease from among men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Were it not for the wrath of the
  enemy, lest they should live long, lest their enemies should combine against
  them; lest they should say, Our own high arm, and not the Lord, has done all
  these things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> It is a nation that has
  lost counsel, neither is there understanding in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> They had not sense to understand: let them
  reserve these things against the time to come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> How should one pursue a thousand, and two rout
  tens of thousands, if God had not sold them, and the Lord delivered them up?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For their gods are not as our God,
  but our enemies are void of understanding. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and their
  vine-branch of Gomorrha: their grape is a grape of gall, their cluster is one
  of bitterness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Their wine is the rage
  of serpents, and the incurable rage of asps. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Lo! are not these things stored up by me, and
  sealed among my treasures? <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> In the day
  of vengeance I will recompense, whensoever their foot shall be tripped up;
  for the day of their destruction is near to them, and the judgments at hand
  are close upon you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> For the Lord
  shall judge his people, and shall be comforted over his servants; for he saw
  that they were utterly weakened, and failed in the hostile invasion, and were
  become feeble: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and the Lord said,
  Where are their gods on whom they trusted? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> the fat of whose sacrifices ye ate, and ye drank
  the wine of their drink-offerings? let them arise and help you, and be your
  protectors. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Behold, behold that I am
  he, and there is no god beside me: I kill, and I will make to live: I will
  smite, and I will heal; and there is none who shall deliver out of my hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> For I will lift up my hand to heaven,
  and swear by my right hand, and I will say, I live for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> For I will sharpen my sword like lightning, and
  my hand shall take hold of judgment; and I will render judgment to my
  enemies, and will recompense them that hate me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> I will make my weapons drunk with blood, and my
  sword shall devour flesh, it shall glut itself with the blood of the wounded,
  and from the captivity of the heads of their enemies that rule over them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Rejoice, ye heavens, with him, and
  let all the angels of God worship him; rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people,
  and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; for he will avenge
  the blood of his sons, and he will render vengeance, and recompense justice
  to his enemies, and will reward them that hate him; and the Lord shall purge
  the land of his people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And Moses
  wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel; and
  Moses went in and spoke all the words of this law in the ears of the people,
  he and Joshua the son of Naue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And
  Moses finished speaking to all Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And he said to them, Take heed with your heart to
  all these words, which I testify to you this day, which ye shall command your
  sons, to observe and do all the words of this law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> For this is no vain word to you; for it is your
  life, and because of this word ye shall live long upon the land, into which
  ye go over Jordan to inherit it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And
  the Lord spoke to Moses in this day, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Go up to the mount Abarim, this mountain Nabau
  which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho, and behold the land of
  Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and
  be added to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Or, and was added
  to his people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Because ye disobeyed
  my word among the children of Israel, at the waters of strife of Cades in the
  wilderness of Sin; because ye sanctified me not among the sons of Israel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Thou shalt see the land before thee,
  but thou shalt not enter into it.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy33">33</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And this
  is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of
  Israel before his death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he said,
  The Lord is come from Sina, and has appeared from Seir to us, and has hasted
  out of the mount of Pharan, with the ten thousands of Cades; on his right
  hand were his angels with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he
  spared his people, and all his sanctified ones are under thy hands; and they
  are under thee; and he received of his words <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> the law which Moses charged us, an inheritance to
  the assemblies of Jacob. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he shall
  be prince with the beloved one, when the princes of the people are gathered
  together with the tribes of Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Let Ruben live, and not die; and let him be many in number. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And this is the blessing of Juda; Hear, Lord, the
  voice of Juda, and do thou visit his people: his hands shall contend for him,
  and thou shalt be a help from his enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And to Levi he said, Give to Levi his
  manifestations, and his truth to the holy man, whom they tempted in the
  temptation; they reviled him at the water of strife. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who says to his father and mother, I have not seen
  thee; and he knew not his brethren, and he refused to know his sons: he kept
  thine oracles, and observed thy covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They shall declare thine ordinances to Jacob, and
  thy law to Israel: they shall place incense in the time of thy wrath
  continually upon thine altar. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Bless,
  Lord, his strength, and accept the works of his hands; break the loins of his
  enemies that have risen up against him, and let not them that hate him rise
  up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And to Benjamin he said, The
  beloved of the Lord shall dwell in confidence, and God overshadows him
  always, and he rested between his shoulders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And to Joseph he said, His land is of the
  blessing of the Lord, of the seasons of sky and dew, and of the deeps of
  wells below, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and of the fruits of the
  changes of the sun in season, and of the produce of the months, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> from the top of the ancient mountains, and from
  the top of the everlasting hills, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and
  of the fullness of the land in season: and let the things pleasing to him
  that dwelt in the bush come on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of him
  who was glorified above his brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  His beauty is as the firstling of his bull, his horns are the horns of a
  unicorn; with them he shall thrust the nations at once, even from the end of
  the earth: these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the
  thousands of Manasse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And to Zabulon
  he said, Rejoice, Zabulon, in thy going out, and Issachar in his tents.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They shall utterly destroy the
  nations, and ye shall call men there, and there offer the sacrifice of
  righteousness; for the wealth of the sea shall suckle thee, and so shall the
  marts of them that dwell by the sea-coast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And to Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges
  Gad: as a lion he rested, having broken the arm and the ruler. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he saw his first-fruits, that there the land
  of the princes gathered with the chiefs of the people was divided; the Lord
  wrought righteousness, and his judgment with Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And to Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp, and
  shall leap out of Basan. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And to
  Nephthali he said, Nephthali has the fulness of good things; and let him be
  filled with blessing from the Lord: he shall inherit the west and the south.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And to Aser he said, Aser is blessed
  with children; and he shall be acceptable to his brethren: he shall dip his
  foot in oil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> His sandal shall be iron
  and brass; as thy days, so shall be thy strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> There is not any such as the God of the beloved;
  he who rides upon the heaven is thy helper, and the magnificent One of the
  firmament. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the rule of God shall
  protect thee, and that under the strength of the everlasting arms; and he
  shall cast forth the enemy from before thy face, saying, Perish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Israel shall dwell in confidence alone on the
  land of Jacob, with corn and wine; and the sky shall be misty with dew upon
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Blessed art thou, O Israel; who
  is like to thee, O people saved by the Lord? thy helper shall hold his shield
  over thee, and his sword is thy boast; and thine enemies shall speak falsely
  to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their neck.
  <h3 id="deuteronomy34">34</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And
  Moses went up from Araboth Moab to the mount of Nabau, to the top of Phasga,
  which is before Jericho; and the Lord shewed him all the mount of Galaad to
  Dan, and all the land of Nephthali, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  and all the land of Ephraim and Manasse, and all the land of Juda to the
  farthest sea; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and the wilderness, and
  the country round about Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Segor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord said to Moses, This is
  the land of which I sware to Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your
  seed will I give it: and I have shewed it to thine eyes, but thou shalt not
  go in thither. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> So Moses the servant of
  the Lord died in the land of Moab by the word of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And they buried him in Gai near the house of
  Phogor; and no one has seen his sepulchre to this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at
  his death; his eyes were not dimmed, nor were his natural powers destroyed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the children of Israel wept for
  Moses in Araboth of Moab at Jordan near Jericho thirty days; and the days of
  the sad mourning for Moses were completed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Joshua the son of Naue was filled with the
  spirit of knowledge, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children
  of Israel hearkened to him; and they did as the Lord commanded Moses.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And there rose up no more a prophet
  in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent
  him to work in Egypt on Pharao, and his servants, and all his land;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> the great wonders, and the mighty
  hand which Moses displayed before all Israel.
