  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Paul (the) apostle, who is called,
  of Jesus Christ through (the) wish of God, and Sōsthenēs the brother,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> to the church of God which is in
  Korinthos, they who were sanctified in Christ Jesus, they who are called, who
  are holy, with all who call on (the) name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
  place, theirs and ours: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> (the) grace to
  you and (the) peace from God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I give thanks to my God always for
  you, and for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that in everything ye were enriched in
  him, in all word and all knowledge; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  according as the witness of Christ was confirmed in you: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> so that ye become not lacking in any grace.
  Looking out for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> he (lit. this) who shall confirm you unto the end,
  blameless in (the) day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> God is faithful, he who called you into the
  fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I beseech you, then, my brethren, through (the)
  name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all (may) be saying the same thing,
  and that divisions may not be among you; but that ye may be made perfect in
  one heart and one opinion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For it was
  shown to me concerning you, my brethren, by them of Chloēs, that there are
  strifes among you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But this I say,
  that each one of you saith: 'I indeed am of Paul, but I of Apollō, but I am
  of Kēpha, but I am of Christ.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Christ
  was divided. Was Paul crucified for you, or were ye baptised unto (the) name
  of Paul? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I give thanks, that I
  baptised not any of you except Krispos and Gaios; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> that one should not say, that ye were baptised
  unto my name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But I baptised (the)
  house also of Stephana: further, I know not whether I baptised another.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For Christ sent me not to baptise,
  but to preach good tidings, not in a wisdom of word, that the cross of Christ
  should not become vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For the word
  of the cross to them indeed who will perish is a foolishness, but to us
  (pronoun) namely those who will be saved it is [a] power of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For it is written: I shall (lit. will) destroy
  (the) wisdom of the wise, and (the) knowledge of the understanding ones I
  shall (lit. will) reject.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Where was
  a wise man? Where was a scribe? Where was a searcher of this age? Did not God
  make (the) wisdom of the world foolish? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For since from the wisdom of God the world knew
  not God through the wisdom, God was well pleased through the foolishness of
  the proclaiming to save them who believe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Since the Jews ask signs, and the Greeks seek for
  the wisdom: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but we (pron.) proclaim
  Christ crucified: the Jews indeed it is a scandal to them, but (to) the
  Gentiles it is a foolishness; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but to
  us (pron.), namely those who will be saved, the Jews and the Greeks, Christ
  is a power of God and a wisdom of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
  [the] men, and the weakness of God is stronger than [the] men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For see your calling, my brethren, that not many
  wise according to flesh, not many strong, not many noble: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> but the fools of the world God chose, that he
  might put to shame the wise; and God chose the weaknesses of the world, that
  he might put to shame the strong; <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and
  the ignobilities of the world, and them who are despised, God chose, and them
  who are not, that he might do away with them who are: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> that no flesh should boast themselves before God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> From him (are) ye also in Christ
  Jesus, who became to us [a] wisdom from God, [a] righteousness and [a]
  sanctification and [a] redemption; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  that according as it is written: He who boasteth himself, let him boast
  himself in the Lord.'</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I also having come to you, my
  brethren, came not according to an exaltation of [a] word, or [a] wisdom; I
  showed to you the mystery of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For
  I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and (that) be
  (lit. this) was crucified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I also in
  [a] weakness and [a] fear and a great trembling came to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And my word and my proclaiming was being not in
  persuasions of words of wisdom of man, but n manifestation of a spirit and a
  power, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> that your faith might not be in
  a wisdom of man, but in a power of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But we speak a wisdom among them who are complete:
  but a wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, they (lit.
  these) who will be done away with: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> but
  (it is) a wisdom of God which we speak in a mystery which is hidden, which
  God foreordained before the ages for a glory to us: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> which none of the rulers of this age knew: for if
  they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of (the) glory.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But according as it is written: The
  things which eye saw not, nor ear heard [them], and they went not upon (the)
  heart of man,--the things which God prepared for them who will love him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But to us (pron.) God revealed them
  through the spirit: for the spirit searcheth everything, and the things which
  are deep of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For who among [the]
  men (is it) who knoweth the things of the man except the spirit of the man
  which is in him? thus also the things of God no one knoweth except the spirit
  of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But we (pron.) received not
  the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is (lit. the) from God; that
  we may know the things which God granted to us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Which are these which we speak, not in teachings
  of [the] men, of words of wisdom, but in teachings of the spirit; explaining
  spiritual things to the spiritual (persons). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the psychic man receiveth not the things of
  the spirit of God; for it is [a] foolishness to him, and it is not possible
  for him to know, because it was searched spiritually. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the spiritual (pron.) searcheth everything:
  but no one searcheth him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For who
  knew (the) heart of the Lord? Nay, who will be able to teach him? But we have
  the heart of Christ.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But I also, my brethren, could not
  speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal, as little children in Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I gave you milk to drink, not meat,
  for ye were not yet able: but not even now are ye yet able; for yet (are) ye
  carnal. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For as there is [a] jealousy
  and [a] strife among you, (are) ye not carnal, and ye walked according to
  man? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For if one saith: I indeed am of
  Paulos'; but another: 'I (am) of Apollō'; are ye not men? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> What, then, is Apollō? But what (is) Paulos? They
  are ministers through whom ye believed; each one according as God gave to
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I (pron.) planted, Apollo
  watered; but God caused them to grow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Wherefore neither he who planteth, nor he who watereth is anything; but God
  causeth them to grow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But he who
  planteth and he who watereth are one: but each one will receive his reward
  according to his own toil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For we
  (are) fellow-workers of God; an a husbandry of God ye (are) a building of
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> According to the grace of God
  which is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I laid a foundation; another
  goes on to build. But let each one see carefully in what manner he built.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For another foundation it is not
  possible that another should lay than (lit. outside of) that which is set;
  which is Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If there is he
  who buildeth upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stone, firewood,
  hay, straw; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> (the) work of each one
  shall be manifested: for the day will manifest it, because it will be
  revealed in [a] fire; and (the) work of each one the fire will prove of what
  sort it is. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He whose work will stand
  which he built, will receive his reward. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> He whose work will be burnt, will suffer loss:
  but he himself will be saved, but thus as through [a] fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Ye know not that ye (are) a temple of God, and
  the spirit of God dwelt in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He,
  then, who will defile the temple of God, this (one) will God destroy; for the
  temple of God is holy, which ye are. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Let not any one deceive himself. He who thinketh among you that he is wise in
  this age, let him become foolish, that he may become wise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For (the) wisdom of this world is a foolishness
  with God. For it is written: 'He who overpowereth the wise in their
  craftiness'; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and again: 'The Lord
  knoweth the reasonings of wise (men) that they are vain.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Wherefore let not any one boast himself in [the]
  men. For all things are yours; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  whether Paulos, or Apollō, or Kēpha, or the world, or (the) life, or (the)
  death, or the things which are, or the things which will be; all are yours;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> but ye are of Christ, but Christ is
  of God.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Thus also let [the] men think of us
  as officers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Further, they seek here in the stewards that one
  should be found faithful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> To me
  (pron.) it is a littleness that I should be judged by, you, or by a day of
  human (judgement): but I (pron.) judge not even myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For neither know I (pron.) anything in myself; but
  not even in this am I [not] justified: but he who will judge me is the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Wherefore judge not anything before
  the time, until the Lord come, who will cause the things which are hidden of
  (the) darkness to become light, and manifest the counsels of the hearts; and
  then shall (the) honour of each one be to him from God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But these things, my brethren, I took in form to
  myself and Apollō because of you, that in us ye might learn not to be beyond
  the things which are written, that one should not exalt himself for one
  against his neighbour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For who maketh
  thee to differ? But what hast thou which thou receivedst not? But if thou
  wast also the receiver, why boastest thou thyself as (being) one who (lit.
  thou) received not ? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Already ye were
  satisfied, already ye were made rich without us ye reigned: and I would that
  ye had reigned, that we also might share with you in reigning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For I think that God manifested us, namely, the
  apostles last, as sentenced to death, because we became a spectacle to the
  world and the angels and the men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> We
  are fools because of Christ, ye are wise in Christ; we (are) weak, but ye are
  strong; ye are honoured, but we are despised. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Up to this hour we hunger, and we thirst, we are
  naked, and we are buffeted, and we are not settled; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> we toil, working with our own hands: they rail at
  us, and we bless them; being persecuted, we are longsuffering; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> being blasphemed, we beseech them: we became as
  the rubbish of this world. We became the filth of every one up to this hour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I was not reproaching you, writing
  these things to you, but teaching you as beloved sons of mine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For if ye have ten thousand guides in Christ, but
  not many fathers: in Christ Jesus through the Gospel I (pron.) begat you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I beseech you, then, be ye like me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore I sent to you Timotheos,
  who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord: he (lit. this) will remind
  you of my ways in Christ Jesus, according as I teach in every place in all
  the churches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But as though I come
  not to you, some were proud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But I
  shall come to you quickly, if it be (the) wish of the Lord, and I shall know,
  not (the) word of them who were proud, but their power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the kingdom of God was not being in (the)
  word, but it was in [a] power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> What
  then wish ye? that I should come to you with (lit. in) a rod, or in [a] love
  of spirit of meekness?</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> A fornication is actually heard of
  among you, and a fornication such as is not among the Gentiles even, so that
  one should take (the) wife of his father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And ye also are proud: and why rather mourned ye
  not? That he who did such a thing might be taken away from your midst.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I indeed am not with you in the
  body, but I am with you in the spirit, already judging, as though being with
  you about him who did such a thing; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> in
  (the) name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye should assemble together, with my
  spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> to deliver such an one to Satan for (the)
  destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in (the) day of our
  Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Your boasting is
  not good. Ye know not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Cleanse the old leaven from you, that
  ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For our Pascha also was
  slain, Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> wherefore let us keep
  (our) feast not in an old leaven, nor in a leaven of malice and wickedness;
  but in unleavened (things) of [a] purity and [a] truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix with the
  fornicators: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I was not meaning the
  fornicators of this world, or the wrongdoers, or the extortioners, or the
  idolaters; otherwise ye ought (imperf.) to come out of this world:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> but now I wrote to you not to mix
  with them. If there is one who is named 'Brother ' who (is) a fornicator, or
  a wrongdoer, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner,
  with such an one join not even in eating. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For what have I to do to judge them who are
  outside? Judge ye them who are within, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> but God shall judge them who are outside. Take
  away from you the evil (man).</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> There is one (who) will dare among
  you, having a Matthewter between him and his neighbour, to take judgement
  from the wrongdoers, and not from the saints. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Or know ye not that the saints will judge the
  world? And if the world will be judged before you, ye were not being worthy
  then of small places of judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ye
  know not that we shall (lit. will) judge angels. Much more then things of
  this life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If indeed then ye have
  places of judgement of this life, them who are despised in the church, these
  cause to sit (in judgement). <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I am
  saying it for a reproach to you. Thus there is not any wise man among you for
  whom it is possible to decide between his brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But a brother with a brother is going to take
  judgement, and this before the unbelievers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Already indeed is it altogether a humiliation to
  you, that ye have judgement between one and another of you. Why rather do ye
  not suffer wrong Why not rather b be defrauded? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But ye (are they) who do wrong, and who defraud,
  and this your brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Or know ye not
  that the wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Go not astray then;
  neither fornicator, nor idolater, nor adulterer, nor effeminate, nor sleeper
  with male, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> nor thief, nor wrongdoer,
  nor drunkard, nor insolent, nor extortioner will inherit the kingdom of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And these things were some (of) you:
  but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in (the)
  name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the spirit of our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> It is lawful for me as to everything, but all are
  not profitable: it is lawful for me to do everything, but no one shall be
  able to be in authority over me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The
  meats were for the belly, and the belly for the meats: but this (belly), and
  the others (i.e. the meats) God will do away with. But the body was not being
  for [the] fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but God raised our Lord, and us also
  shall he raise through his power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Ye
  know not that your bodies are members of Christ. (Is it) that I should take
  away, then, the members of Christ, and make them members of (a) harlot? It
  shall not be. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Or know ye not that he
  who joineth himself to the harlot is one body? For they two shall become, he
  said, one flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But he who joineth
  himself to the Lord (is) one spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Flee from [the] fornication. Every sin which the man will do is outside of
  the body; but he who committeth fornication sinned against his own body.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Or know ye not, that your bodies are
  a temple of the holy spirit which is in you, which ye received from God? And
  ye are not your own; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> ye were bought
  with a price: glorify God in your bodies.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But concerning the things which ye
  wrote to me: it is good for the man not to touch (a) woman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But because of the fornications, let each one have
  his wife, and let each one (fem.) have her husband. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let the husband give that which he ought to the
  wife: thus also the wife, let her give that which she ought to her husband.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The wife hath not authority over her
  own body, but it is the husband: but thus also the husband hath not authority
  over his own body, but it is the wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Defraud not one another, except perhaps in [a] consent for a time; that ye
  may devote (yourselves) to [the] prayer, and again come together, that Satan
  may not tempt you because of your incontinency. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But this I say according to a concession, not
  according to commandment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I wish
  that every man should be like me, but each one has a grace from God; the one
  indeed in this manner, but another in this other manner. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I say to them who married (lit. 'took' thus
  again) not, and the widows, that it is good for them, should they abide thus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But if they will not be able to
  contain, let them marry: for it is better (lit. good) to marry than to burn
  (lit. take fire). <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But to them who
  married I order, not I but the Lord, the wife that she should not be
  separated from her husband: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> though,
  if she should be separated, let her stay without marrying; otherwise let her
  be reconciled to her husband; and the husband, that he should not put the
  wife (away). <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But to (the) rest say I
  (pron.), not the Lord: If there is a brother who hath an unbelieving wife,
  and this (wife) consent to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And a wife who hath an unbelieving
  husband, and this (man) is consenting to dwell with her, let her not leave
  the husband.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the unbelieving
  husband was sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife was sanctified
  in the brother: otherwise then your children are unclean; but now they are
  holy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And if the unbelieving will be
  separated, let him be separated: not in bondage (lit. servant) is the brother
  or the sister in such cases: God called you in [a] peace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For how (lit. where) knewest thou, [the] wife,
  that perhaps thou wilt be able to save thy husband? Or how (lit. where)
  knewest thou, [the] man, that perhaps thou wilt be able to save thy wife?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> (It must not be) except in the manner
  which God ordained for each one, as God called each, thus let him walk. Thus
  also I command in all the churches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  One was called being circumcised. Let him not become uncircumcised. One was
  called in [the] uncircumcision. Let him not be circumcised. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For (the) circumcision is nothing, and [the]
  uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Let each one, in the calling in which
  he was called, abide. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou wast
  called being a servant. Let it not be a care to thee: but if it is possible
  for thee to become free, become it rather. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For the servant who was called in the Lord is a
  freedman of the Lord: thus also the freeman who was called is a servant of
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Ye were bought with a price;
  become not servant to [the] men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Let
  each one, my brethren, in that in which he was called, in this abide with
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But concerning the virgins I
  have not commandment from the Lord: but an opinion I give, as having had
  mercy (shown) me by the Lord to be faithful. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I think, then, that this is good [a to be]
  because of the existing necessity, that it is good for the man to be thus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Thou art bound to (a) wife: seek not
  for loosing thyself. Thou art loosed from (a) wife: seek not for (a) wife.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> If, however, thou shouldst marry,
  thou sinnedst not. And if the virgin should marry, she sinneth not. But such
  shall receive a tribulation of their flesh: but I (pron.) spare you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But this I say, my brethren, that
  (the) time is shortened, that henceforth they who have wives should be as
  they who have not; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> they who weep, as
  that they weep not; they who rejoice, as that they rejoice not; they who buy,
  as that they lay not hold; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> they who
  use the world, as that they use 'not to the full: for the fashion of this
  world will pass away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But I wish you
  to be (lit. being) without care. He who married not was careful for the
  things of the Lord, how he will please the Lord: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> but he who married was careful for the world, how
  he will please his wife, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> and he is
  divided. The wife who married not and the virgin. She who married not was
  careful for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy in her body and
  her spirit: but. she who married was careful for the things of the world, how
  she will please her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But this
  I say because of that which is profitable to you, not that I might cast a
  noose over you, but that your fashion may he seemly, and that ye may rest
  with perseverance on the Lord undistractedly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But if there is one (who) thinks to receive shame
  about his virgin; if he should have passed the marriageable prime, and this
  is that which ought to be, let him do his will, he sinneth not; let them
  marry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But he who standeth in his
  heart confirmed, no necessity affecting a him, having authority concerning
  his own will, and this very thing he judgeth in his heart, to keep his
  virgin, he will do well. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Wherefore he
  who giveth his virgin unto a marriage will do well; and he who giveth not his
  (daughter) will do a betters thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  The wife is bound unto her husband for so long time as he liveth; but if her
  husband should have slept, she is (a) free to marry according to her will,
  only in the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But more blessed is
  she if she should stay thus, according to my opinion: but I think also that
  there is a spirit of God in me.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But concerning the things slain for
  idols: we know that there is a knowledge in us all. (The) knowledge exalteth,
  but [the] love edifieth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He who saith:
  I knew something,' knoweth not yet according as it is right to know;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> but he who loveth God, the same (lit.
  this) was known by him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Concerning the
  meats, then, of the things slain for idols, we know that (an) idol is nothing
  in the world , and that there is no God except one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For even if there are some being called God,'
  whether in (the) heaven, or upon the earth; as there are many gods and many
  lords. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But to us (pron.) one is God
  the Father, through whom are all things, and we also into him; one is our
  Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we also through him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But (the) knowledge (is) not in all.
  For some up to now in the custom of the idols eat it as a thing slain for
  idols; and their conscience being weak unto them is polluted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But (it is) not a meat which will commend us to
  God: neither, should we eat not, shall (lit. will) we be deficient; neither,
  should we eat, shall (lit. will) we abound. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But see lest by any means this your authority
  should be a stumbling-block to them who are weak; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> should one see thee, namely he who hath (the)
  knowledge, reclining in a place of idols. Will 'nct his conscience, being of
  one weak, be encouraged a to cause him to eat a thing slain for idols?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he who is weak is destroyed in
  thy knowledge, the brother for whom Christ died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But thus, sinning against (0 the brethren, and
  striking their weak conscience, ye sinned against (e) Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore, if a meat will cause my brother to
  offend, I shall not eat flesh at all b, that I may not cause my brother to
  offend.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Am I not free? Am not I an apostle?
  Saw I not Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> If I am not an apostle to others, but I am to you:
  for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My defence to them who search me is this.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Have we not authority to eat and to
  drink? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Have we authority to cause a
  sister as wife to walk after us, as (the) rest of the apostles, and the
  brethren of the Lord, and Kēpha? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Or I
  only and Barnabas, have not we authority not to work? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Who ever becometh soldier from his own pay? Who
  planteth a vineyard, and eateth from his fruit? Or who tendeth a flock of
  sheep, and eateth not from (the) milk of the flock? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Spake I these things according to man, or saith
  not the law also itself these things? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  For it is written in (the) law of Moses: 'Thou shalt not muzzle (the) ox,
  threshing.' Was it a care to God for the oxen? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Or altogether he said it because of us? For it
  was written because of us: because it is worthy that he who plougheth should
  plough in [a] hope; and he who thresheth should hope to receive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If we (pron.) sowed to you the spiritual things,
  it is great if we should reap your earned thing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If others have authority over you, much rather
  we. But (a) we used not this authority; but we are long-suffering in all
  things, that we may not give any stumbling-block to the Gospel of Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Ye know not that they who work (for)
  the temples eat from the things of the temple, and they who wait upon the
  altar are divided unto with the altar. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thus the Lord also ordained to them who proclaim
  the Gospel to live from the Gospel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  But I used not any of these: but I wrote not these, that they should be done
  thus in me: for it is good for me rather to die than that any should [not]
  make my boast void. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For if I should
  preach good tidings, it is not to me [a] boasting; for a necessity is laid
  upon me; for woe to me if I should not preach good tidings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For if I did this willingly, then I have reward:
  if not willingly, then I was entrusted with a stewardship. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> What then is my reward? That, preaching good
  tidings, I may make the Gospel without expense, (so as) not to use this
  authority in the Gospel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For being
  free from all, I made myself servant of all, that I might gain the more.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> I became to the Jews as a Jew, that I
  might gain the Jews; I became to them who are under (the) law as being under
  (the) law, (though) I am not under (the) law, that I might gain them who are
  under (the) law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I became to them
  without law as one without law, though I am not one without law of God, but
  being under (the) law of Christ, that I might gain them without law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> I became to them who are weak as one
  weak, that I might gain them who are weak: I became to all men all kinds,
  that by all means I might save some. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  But I do all these things because of the Gospel, that I may share it (with
  others). <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Ye know not that they who
  run in the stadium, run indeed all, but one receiveth the palm. But thus run,
  that ye may attain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But every one who
  striveth for the mastery layeth hold on himself in everything: they indeed,
  that they may receive a crown which will perish; but we an imperishable.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But I (pron.) run thus, as not
  covertly; thus I fight, not as beating the air: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> but I bruise my body, and I make it servant: lest
  by any means, having proclaimed to others, I myself should be found [being]
  reprobate.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For I wish you not to be (lit.
  being) ignorant, my brethren, that all our fathers were being under the
  cloud, and they all passed through the sea; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and they were all baptised unto Moses in the cloud
  and in the sea; <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and the same spiritual
  food they all ate; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and the same
  spiritual drink they all drank: for they were drinking from a spiritual rock,
  following them: but the rock was Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But God was not well pleased with most of them:
  for they were overthrown in (the) desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But these things became to us types, that we
  should not be [being] lusters after evil things, according as those lusted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Neither be ye idolaters, as some among
  them; as it is written: 'The people sat down to eat and to drink; and they
  arose to play.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Neither let us commit
  fornication, as some among them committed, and twenty-three thousand fell in
  one day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Neither let us tempt Christ,
  according as some among them tempted; and they were destroyed by the
  serpents. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Neither let us be
  murmurers, according as some among them murmured; and they were destroyed by
  the destroyer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But all these things
  happened as type to those; but they were written for us for a teaching,
  namely those to whom (the) end of the ages occurred. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Wherefore he who thinketh that he standeth, let
  him see lest by any means he fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  The temptation took you not, except the temptation of man: faithful is God,
  who will not let you be tempted beyond that which it is possible for you (to
  bear); but he will help with you in the temptation, that ye may be able to
  bear until ye come out of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  Therefore, my beloved, flee from the idolatry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I say it to you as (to) wise; judge ye that which
  I say. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The cup of the Eulogia which
  we bless, is it not the sharing of (the) blood of Christ? The loaf which we
  break, is it not the sharing of (the) body of Christ? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because we (pron.) are one loaf, one body, namely
  the many: for we (pron.) all receive from the same loaf. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> See Israel according to flesh: are not they who
  eat of the sacrifices sharers with the altar? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> What then say I? 'The thing slain for idols, what
  is it?' or 'what itself is (an) idol?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But that the things which the Gentiles slay, they
  slay them for the idols, and not God. But I wish you not to be (lit. being)
  sharers with the demons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It is not
  possible for you to drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of the demons:
  it is not possible for you to receive from the table of the Lord and the
  table of the demons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Or are we to
  rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> It is lawful to do everything; but all things are
  not profitable. It is lawful to do everything; but all things edify not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Let not any seek for his own, but for
  that of his neighbour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> All things
  which are sold in the meat-market eat, making no enquiry because of the
  conscience; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> for the earth is the
  Lord's, and its fulness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> If one of
  the unbelievers invite you, and ye wish, go. All things which they will set
  before you, eat, making no enquiry because of the conscience. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if one should say to you: This is a thing
  slain for idols,' eat not, because of him who showed to you, and because of
  the conscience; <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> but I say because of
  a conscience: it is not thine, but that of thy neighbour. For why will my
  liberty be judged by another conscience? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> If I (pron.) receive in [a] thanksgiving, why am
  I blasphemed about that for which I (pron.) give thanks? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Whether, then, ye eat, or ye drink, or ye do
  (any) other thing, do all things unto the glorifying God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And be ye offenceless to the Jews and the Greeks
  and the church of God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> according as I
  also in all things please all, not seeking for mine own profit, but that of
  the many, that they may be saved.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Be ye like me, according as I also
  am like Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But I honour you
  because ye remember me in all things, and according as I delivered to you the
  traditions, ye lay hold on them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I
  wish you to know (lit, knowing) that (the) head of every man is Christ, but
  (the) head of the woman is her husband, but (the) head of Christ is God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Every man who prayeth or prophesieth,
  having his head covered, is shaming his head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But every woman praying or prophesying with her
  head not covered shameth her head: for it is one and it is the same as she
  whose head is shaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For if a woman
  will not cover her head, then let her shave it: if it is a dishonour unto a
  woman to shear her head, or to shave it, let her cover her head. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For the man indeed ought not to cover his head,
  because he is an image and a glory of God: but the woman--she is a glory of
  her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the man was not
  brought from the woman, but the woman from the man: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> for the man was not also created because of the
  woman, but the woman because of the man: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> therefore the woman ought to put a veil upon her
  head because of the angels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Nevertheless neither is a woman without man nor man without woman in the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For according as the woman is
  [a] from the man, thus also the man is [a] through a the woman; all things
  are from God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Judge in your own
  selves: that it was seemly for a woman to pray to God with her head not
  covered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Not even [the] nature
  herself teacheth you, That the man indeed, if he have long hair, it is a
  dishonour to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the woman, if
  she have long hair, it is a glory to her; because the hair was given to her
  instead of a veil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But if (any) one
  thinketh to be contentious, [but] we (pron.) have not such a custom, neither
  the churches of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But ordering
  this I was not justifying you, because ye assemble not for the better, but
  the worse. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For first indeed, being
  about to assemble together in the church, I hear of divisions being among
  you, and. I partly believe (it). <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For
  there must be heresies among you, that the chosen also who are among you
  might be manifested. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Being about to
  assemble, then, together, it is not to eat a Lord's Supper: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> for each one taketh before (another) from his
  supper to eat; there is (one) who is hungry indeed, but there is (one) who is
  drunken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For have ye not houses to
  eat and to drink (in)? Or despised ye the church of God, and shamed them who
  have not? What shall (lit. will, thus again) I say to you? (Is it) that I
  justify you in this? I shall not justify you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For I (pron.) received from the Lord that which I
  delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was about to
  be betrayed (lit. given) took a loaf; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  and he gave thanks, he brake it, and he said: 'This is my body, which will be
  given for you: this do for remembrance of me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus also the cup after the supper, saying: 'This
  cup is the new testament in my blood. This do every time (in) which ye will
  drink it, remembering me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For every
  time (in) which ye will eat this bread and drink this cup, ye area
  proclaiming (the) death of the Lord until he come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Wherefore he who will eat from this bread and
  drink from this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and
  the blood of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But let the
  man prove himself, and thus let him eat from the bread and drink from the
  cup. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For he who eateth and who
  drinketh, ate and drank for a judgement to him, not (being) discerner of the
  body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Therefore many are weak among
  you, and they are in pain; and many sleep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For if we were discerning ourselves, we should
  not be judged. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For God is judging us,
  teaching us, that we may not be condemned with the Gentiles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Wherefore then, my brethren, should ye assemble
  to eat, stay for one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> If
  there is he who is hungry, let him eat in his house; that ye may not assemble
  for a judgement. But (the) rest (of the things), should I come, I shall
  ordain.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But concerning the spiritual
  (gifts), my brethren, I wish you not to be (lit. being) ignorant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Ye know that, being Gentiles, being
  under the voiceless idols, ye were walking (along) as ye were led.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Therefore I show to you, that no one
  speaking in the spirit of God saith that Jesus is an anathema; and it is not
  possible that any should say that Jesus (is) the Lord except in a holy
  spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But there are distributions
  existing of graces, though it is the same spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And there are distributions existing of
  ministrations, though it is the same Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And there are distributions of works, though it is
  the same God who worketh all things in all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But to each one is given (the) manifestation of
  the spirit according to that which is profitable. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For to one indeed is given through the spirit a
  word of wisdom; but to another a word of knowledge according to the same
  spirit: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but to another [a] faith in
  the same spirit; but to another graces of healing in the same spirit;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but to another works of power; but to
  another [a] prophecy; but to another explaining of spirit; but to another
  kinds of tongues; but to another an interpretation of tongues: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> but all these the one which worketh in them is
  the same spirit, dividing to each one according as he willeth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For according as the body is one, (yet) it hath
  many members, but all the members of the body are being many, but it is one
  body; thus Christ also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For we also
  were all baptised in one spirit unto one body, whether the Jews or the Greeks
  or servant or free, and we were all made to drink one spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For the body also is not one member, but many.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If the foot should say: I am not a
  hand, I am not from the body,' it is not, in consequence of this, not from
  the body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if the ear should say:
  I am not an eye, I am not from the body,' it is not, in consequence of this,
  not from the body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If the whole body
  were an eye, where had been also the hearing? If the whole were an hearing,
  where was also the smelling? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But now
  God put the members each one of them in the body according as he wished.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> If all were one member, where had
  been also the body? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But now many
  indeed are the members, but the body is one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It is not possible that the eye should say to the
  hand: `I have no need of thee,' or again the head to the feet: 'I have no
  need of you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But rather the members
  of the body, of which they think that they are feeble, these are more
  necessary: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and those of the body, of
  which we think that they are unhonoured, to these we give more honour; and
  our ugly things have more beauty (given them); <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> but our beautiful things have no need: but God
  tempered the body, having given more honour to that which lacked;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> that there might not be division in
  the body; but that all the members might care for one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And if there is a member suffering, all the
  members suffer with it; if there is a member glorified, all the members
  rejoice with it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But ye are (the)
  body of Christ, and his members severally. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> They indeed whom God put in the churches, first
  apostles, (the) second prophets, (the) third teachers, after these powers,
  then graces of healing, helps, guidances, kinds of tongues. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Will all be apostles? Will all be prophets? Will
  all be teachers? Will all be powers? <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  Have all graces of healing? Will all speak in tongues? Will all interpret?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But be zealous for the great graces.
  And yet also I shall (lit. will) show to you another greater way.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> If I should speak in (the) tongue
  of the men and that of the angels, but I have not love, I was as a sounding
  brass or a clashing cymbal. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Even if I
  have [a] prophecy, knowing all the mysteries and all (the) knowledge; even if
  I have all (the) faith so as to remove mountains, but I have not love, I (am)
  nothing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Even if I should give all my
  (goods) to cause them to eat, and give my body also that I may boast, but I
  have not love, I gain nothing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> [The]
  love is longsuffering; hopeth; love envieth not; love is not puffed up; is
  not proud; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> is not put to shame;
  seeketh not for her own; is not angry; thinketh not the evil; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> rejoiceth not over (the) wrongdoing, but rejoiceth
  over (the) truth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> is longsuffering in
  all things; believeth in all things; hopeth in all things: endureth in all
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Love never falleth. Whether
  the prophecies--they will be done away; whether the tongues--they will cease;
  whether [a] knowledge--it will be done away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For in [a] part we know, and in [a] part we
  prophesy: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but if the perfect should
  come, the in part will be done away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Being a child, I was speaking as a child, I was meditating as a child, I was
  thinking as a child, when I became man I did away the things of my childhood.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For we see now through a glass in a
  likeness, then we shall (lit. will) see face to face. I know now in [a] part;
  but then (lit. in the time) I shall (lit. will) know, according as I was
  known. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But now these three abide,
  (the) faith, [the] hope, (the) love; but the great among these is [the]
  love.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Pursue after [the] love, but be
  zealous for the spiritual (gifts), but rather that ye may prophesy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He who speaketh in (the) tongue is
  speaking not to the men but God; for no one heareth him: in the spirit, then,
  he speaketh mysteries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he who
  prophesieth spoke to the men for an edification and a comfort and a
  consolation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He who speaketh in (the)
  tongue edified himself alone; but he who prophesieth edified a church.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But I wish you all to speak (lit.
  speaking) in tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: but greater is he
  who prophesieth than he who speaketh in (the) tongue, except he interpret,
  that the church may receive an edification. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But now, my brethren, if I should come to you,
  speaking in tongues, what profit shall (lit. will) I give to you unless I
  speak to you in a revelation, or in [a] knowledge, or in a prophecy, or in a
  teaching? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Even the soulless things
  giving their voice, whether a pipe or a harp, unless they make distinction of
  their voice, how will they know that which is piped or that which is harped?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For if a trumpet also should give a
  voice not manifest, who will prepare himself for (the) war? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Thus ye also through (the) tongue, if ye should
  not say a word manifest, how will they know that which ye say? For ye will be
  as speaking unto (the) air. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> There are
  many sorts of voice in this world, and there is not anything being voiceless.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If I should not know (the) power of
  the voice, I shall (lit. will) be (a) barbarian for him who speaketh, and he
  who speaketh to me will be (a) barbarian for me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thus ye also, since ye are zealous of the
  spiritual (gifts) unto (the) edification of the church, seek that ye may
  abound (in them). <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Therefore he who
  speaketh in (the) tongue--let him pray that he may interpret. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if I should pray in (the) tongue, my spirit
  prayeth, but my heart is unfruitful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  What then shall (lit. will) I do? I shall pray in the spirit, but I shall
  pray in the heart also; I shall sing in the spirit, but I shall sing in the
  heart also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Or otherwise if thou
  shouldst bless in the spirit, he who filleth up (the) place of the unlearned,
  how will he say the Amēn upon thy thanksgiving, since that which thou sayest
  he knoweth it not? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For thou indeed
  givest thanks well, but the other one is not edified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I give thanks to God that I speak in (the) tongue
  more than ye all: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> but I wish to say
  five words in my understanding in the church, that I may instruct others,
  than ten thousand words in (the) tongue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> My brethren, be not children in your
  understandings: but be children in [the] malice, but in your understandings
  be of full (age). <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For it is written
  in (the) law: 'In other tongues and in other lips I shall (lit. will) speak
  to this people; and thus also they shall not hearken to me, saith the Lord.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Wherefore the tongues were being for
  a sign not to them who believe, but to the unbelievers: but the prophecy was
  being not for the unbelievers, but for them who believe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If then the whole church should come together,
  and all speak in tongues, but unlearned come in or unbelievers, will they not
  say: 'These were mad?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But if all are
  prophesying, but an unbeliever or an unlearned come in, all will convict him;
  all will search him (out). <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The
  secrets of his heart will be manifested; and thus he will throw himself upon
  his face and worship God, manifesting that really God is among you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> What, then, is it, my brethren? If ye
  should assemble, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation,
  hath language of tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done in an
  edifying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Whether (it be) he who
  speaketh in (the) tongue, (let it be) by two or the most three, and a turn
  for (the) one, and let one interpret. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  But if there is not an interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; but
  let him speak between himself and God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But prophets two or three let them speak, and let
  the others discern. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But if a
  revelation be made in another sitting down, let the first keep silence.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For it is possible for you all to
  prophesy one by one, that all may be taught, and all find comfort;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> the spirits of the prophets are
  subject to the prophets; <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> for God is
  not of division, but of peace; as it is in all the churches of the saints.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Let the women keep silence in the
  church, and they are not commanded to speak; but let them be subject,
  according as saith also the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But
  if they wish to know a thing, let them ask their men in their houses: for it
  is a disgrace to a woman to speak in the church. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Or did (the) word of God come from you? Or did it
  reach you alone? <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> If there is one
  thinking of himself that he is a prophet or a spiritual, let him know the
  things which I write to you, that it is a commandment of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But if there is one being ignorant, they are
  ignorant of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Wherefore, my
  brethren, be zealous of prophesying, and forbid not to speak in tongues.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But let all things be done unto an
  edifying and according to regulation.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But I show to you, my brethren, the
  Gospel with which I preached good tidings to you, which is that which ye
  received, this in which ye stand, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> this
  also through which ye will be saved; because in a word I preached good
  tidings to you, if ye lay hold on it, except ye believed in vain.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For I delivered unto you first that
  which I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and that he was buried; and that he
  rose in the third day according to the Scriptures; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and he appeared unto Kēpha; then he appeared to
  the twelve; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> afterwards he appeared
  (to) above five hundred brethren at once, of these the majority of them abide
  up to now, but others fell asleep.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Then he appeared to Jacōbos, then he appeared to all the apostles ;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but last of them all, as one born out
  of due time, he appeared to me also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  For I am the least a among all the apostles, being not worthy to be called '
  apostle,' because that I persecuted the church of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But in a grace of God I am that which I am: and
  his grace which is in me was not void; but I toiled more than they all: but
  not I, but the grace of God which is with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Whether then I or they, we proclaim thus, and
  thus ye believed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But if Christ is
  proclaimed, that he rose from them who are dead, how say some among you, that
  there will not be resurrection of the dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But if there will not be resurrection of the
  dead, then neither did Christ rise: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  but if Christ rose not, then our proclaiming is void, your faith also is
  void. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But again we shall (lit. will)
  be found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised
  Christ, a whom he raised not, if then the dead will not rise. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For if the dead will not rise, then Christ rose
  not: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> but if Christ rose not, your
  faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Then they who fell asleep in Christ perished.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But if in this life only we hoped on
  Christ, then we are pitiable more than all men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But now Christ rose from them who are dead, (the)
  firstfruits of them who fell asleep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  For since through a man (the) death happened, through man also (the)
  resurrection of the dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For as in
  Adam we shall (lit. will) all die, thus also in Christ we shall (lit. will)
  all live: <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> each one in his order.
  Firstfruits Christ, then they of Christ in his coming. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Then cometh the end whenever he should deliver
  the kingdom to God and the Father, if he should do away with all rule and all
  authority and all power. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For he must
  reign until he hath put all his enemies below his feet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But the last enemy he will do away: that is to
  say (the) death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He caused all things
  to be subject below his feet. But if he should say that all things were made
  subject to him, it is manifest that (it is so) except him who caused all
  things to be subject to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if
  all things should be subject to him, then the Son also himself shall be
  subject to him who caused all things to be subject to him; that God himself
  may be all things in all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Otherwise
  what will they do who are baptised for the dead? If the dead will not rise at
  all, then why are they baptised also for them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Why are we also in danger every hour?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> I am dead daily (I affirm it) by your
  boast, my brethren, this which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> If humanly (speaking) I fought with the wild
  beast in Ephesos, what is my gain? If the dead will not. rise, let us eat and
  drink, for to-morrow we shall (lit, will) die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Go not astray: for the evil words corrupt the
  good hearts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Be watchful righteously,
  and sin not; for an ignorance of God (it is) which is in some: I spoke to you
  in [a] shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But there is one (who)
  will say: 'How will the dead rise? But in what body came they?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> [The] senseless (man), that which thou (pron.)
  sowest, liveth not unless it die: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> and
  that which thou sowest--the body which will be is (not, pron.) that which
  thou sowest, but it is a grain, naked, whether [a] wheat or another of (the)
  rest of the seeds; <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> but God giveth (a)
  body to it, according as he wished, and to each of the seeds he giveth their
  own body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> All flesh is not the same
  flesh, but a different flesh indeed of the men, a different flesh, of the
  beasts, a different flesh of the birds, different that of the fishes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> There is also a body of (the) heaven,
  there is a body of (the) earth; but different indeed is (the) glory of the
  things of (the) heaven, but different is (the) glory of the things of (the)
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Different is (the) glory of
  (the) sun, different is (the) glory of the moon, different is (the) glory of
  the stars; for there is a star differing from star in its glory. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is
  sown in a corruption; it will rise in an incorruption; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> it is sown in a dishonour; it will rise in a
  glory; it is sown in a feebleness; it will rise in a power. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> A psychic body is sown; a spiritual body will
  rise. If there is a psychic body, then there is also a spiritual body.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> It was written indeed also thus:
  'Adam the first man became a living soul.' But the last Adam (is) a
  life-giving spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> But the spiritual
  is not the first, but the psychic; after it the spiritual. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> The first man is from (the) earth, one of earth:
  the second man is from (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span>
  As the one of earth, thus also the ones of earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> and as the one of heaven, thus also the ones of
  heaven. And as we bore (the) image of the one of earth, let us bear the image
  of the one of heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> But this I say,
  my brethren, that flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God;
  neither will (the) corruption inherit the incorruption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Lo, a mystery I say to you: we shall (lit. will)
  not all fall asleep indeed, but we shall (lit, will) all be changed,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> in a moment, in a twinkling of eye,
  at (lit. in) the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall call, and the dead shall
  rise incorruptible; and we also shall (lit. will) be changed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> For this which will corrupt must be clothed with
  the incorruption; and this which will die be clothed with the immortality.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> But whenever this which will die
  should be clothed with the immortality, then shall come to pass the word
  which is written: '(The) death was swallowed up unto a victory.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> Where was thy victory, (the) death? Where was thy
  sting, (the) death? <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> For (the) sting
  of (the) death is (the) sin; but (the) power of (the) sin is (the) law.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> But thanks be given to God, [this]
  who giveth the victory to us through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> Wherefore, my brethren beloved, be ye stedfast,
  immoveable, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that your toil
  is not void in the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="first_epistle_to_the_corinthians16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But concerning the collection which
  was made concerning the saints, as I commanded the churches of (the) Galatia,
  do ye also thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Every first of the
  sabbaths let each one of you lay by him, treasuring (lit. throwing in)
  according as (lit. that in which) his way will prosper (lit. be
  straightened), lest by any means, should I come, then should be countings up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But if I should come, them of whom ye
  approve, I shall send these through letters to take your grace to Jerusalem:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> but if the work is worthy to cause me
  to go also, they shall walk with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  But I shall come to you, if I should pass by (the) Macedonia; for I shall
  (lit. will) pass by (the) Macedonia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  But perchance I might stay with you, or I might spend the winter, that ye
  (pron.) may escort me to the place to which I shall (lit. will) go.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For I wish not to see you now, being
  on (the) road; for I hope to spend time with you, if the Lord should command.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I shall (lit. will) be in Ephesos
  until the Pentēcostē <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For a great door
  effectual was opened to me, and (there are) many adversaries. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But if adversaries Timotheos should come, see
  that he may come to you without fear; for the work of the Lord he worketh, as
  also I (do). <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let no one then despise
  him: but escort him in [a] peace that he may come to me: for I expect him
  with the brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But concerning
  Apollo the brother, I besought him very much that he might come to you with
  the brethren: and it is not at all (the) wish that he should come now; but he
  shall come to you if he should find (the) opportunity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Watch, then, and stand in (the) faith; master
  yourselves, and take courage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Let all
  works which are yours be done in [a] love. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I beseech you, then, our brethren--ye know (the)
  house of Stephana and Phortounatos, that it is (the) beginning of [the]
  Achaia, and they ordained themselves to a ministry of the saints,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> that ye also be subject to such, and
  every one who is a fellow worker and who toileth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But I rejoice over (the) coming of Stephana and
  Phortounatos and Achaikos, because your deficiency these filled up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For they rested my spirit and yours:
  know, then, such (persons). <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The
  churches of [the] Asia salute you. Akula and Priska salute you very much in
  the Lord, with the church of their house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> All the brethren who are with me salute you.
