  <h3 id="nahum1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The burden of
  Nineve: the book of the vision of Naum the Elkesite. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> God is jealous, and the Lord avenges; the Lord
  avenges with wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he cuts
  off his enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> The Lord is
  long-suffering, and his power is great, and the Lord will not hold any
  guiltless: his way is in destruction and in the whirlwind, and the clouds are
  the dust of his feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> He threatens the
  sea, and dries it up, and exhausts all the rivers: the land of Basan, and
  Carmel are brought low, and the flourishing trees of Libanus have come to
  nought. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The mountains quake at him,
  and the hills are shaken, and the earth recoils at his presence, even the
  world, and all that dwell in it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Who
  shall stand before his anger? and who shall withstand in the anger of his
  wrath? his wrath brings to nought kingdoms, and the rocks are burst asunder
  by him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The Lord is good to them that
  wait on him in the day of affliction; and he knows them that reverence him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But with an overrunning flood he will
  make an utter end: darkness shall pursue those that rise up against him and
  his enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> What do ye devise against
  the Lord? he will make a complete end: he will not take vengeance by
  affliction twice at the same time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  For the enemy shall be laid bare even to the foundation, and shall be
  devoured as twisted yew, and as stubble fully dry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Out of thee shall proceed a device against the
  Lord, counselling evil things hostile to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Thus saith the Lord who rules over many waters,
  Even thus shall they be sent away, and the report of thee shall not be heard
  any more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And now will I break his
  rod from off thee, and will burst thy bonds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the Lord shall give a command concerning
  thee; there shall no more of thy name be scattered: I will utterly destroy
  the graven images out of the house of thy god, and the molten images: I will
  make thy grave; for they are swift. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings glad tidings, and
  publishes peace! O Juda, keep thy feasts, pay thy vows: for they shall no
  more pass through thee to thy decay.
  <h3 id="nahum2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> It is all over
  with him, he has been removed, one who has been delivered from affliction has
  come up panting into thy presence, watch the way, strengthen thy loins, be
  very valiant in thy strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For the
  Lord has turned aside the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: for they
  have utterly rejected them, and have destroyed their branches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They have destroyed the arms of their power from
  among men, their mighty men sporting with fire: the reins of their chariots
  shall be destroyed in the day of his preparation, and the horsemen shall be
  thrown into confusion <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> in the ways, and
  the chariots shall clash together, and shall be entangled in each other in
  the broad ways: their appearance is as lamps of fire, and as gleaming
  lightnings. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And their mighty men shall
  bethink themselves and flee by day; and they shall be weak as they go; and
  they shall hasten to her walls, and shall prepare their defences.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The gates of the cities have been
  opened, and the palaces have fallen into ruin, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and the foundation has been exposed; and she has
  gone up, and her maid-servants were led away as doves moaning in their
  hearts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And as for Nineve, her waters
  shall be as a pool of water: and they fled, and staid not, and there was none
  to look back. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They plundered the
  silver, they plundered the gold, and there was no end of their adorning; they
  were loaded with it upon all their pleasant vessels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> There is thrusting forth, and shaking, and
  tumult, and heart-breaking, and loosing of knees, and pangs on all loins; and
  the faces of all are as the blackening of a pot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Where is the dwelling-place of the lions, and the
  pasture that belonged to the whelps? where did the lion go, that the lionâ€™s
  whelp should enter in there, and there was none to scare him away?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The lion seized enough prey for his
  whelps, and strangled for his young lions, and filled his lair with prey, and
  his dwelling-place with spoil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will burn up thy
  multitude in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy lions; and I will
  utterly destroy thy prey from off the land, and thy deeds shall no more at
  all be heard of.
  <h3 id="nahum3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> O city of blood,
  wholly false, full of unrighteousness; the prey shall not be handled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The noise of whips, and the noise of
  the rumbling of wheels, and of the pursuing horse, and of the bounding
  chariot, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and of the mounting rider,
  and of the glittering sword, and of the gleaming arms, and of a multitude of
  slain, and of heavy falling: and there was no end to her nations, but they
  shall be weak in their bodies <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> because
  of the abundance of fornication: she is a fair harlot, and well-favoured,
  skilled in sorcery, that sells the nations by her fornication, and peoples by
  her sorceries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Behold, I am against
  thee, saith the Lord God Almighty, and I will uncover thy skirts in thy
  presence, and I will shew the nations thy shame, and the kingdoms thy
  disgrace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And I will cast abominable
  filth upon thee according to thine unclean ways, and will make thee a public
  example. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it shall be that every
  one that sees thee shall go down from thee, and shall say, Wretched Nineve!
  who shall lament for her? whence shall I seek comfort for her? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Prepare thee a portion, tune the chord, prepare a
  portion for Ammon: she that dwells among the rivers, water is round about
  her, whose dominion is the sea, and whose walls are water. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And Ethiopia is her strength, and Egypt; and there
  was no limit of the flight of her enemies; and the Libyans became her
  helpers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Yet she shall go as a
  prisoner into captivity, and they shall dash her infants against the ground
  at the top of all her ways: and they shall cast lots upon all her glorious
  possessions, and all her nobles shall be bound in chains. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou shalt be drunken, and shalt be
  overlooked; and thou shalt seek for thyself strength because of thine
  enemies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> All thy strong-holds are as
  fig-trees having watchers: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth
  of the eater. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Behold, thy people
  within thee are as women: the gates of thy land shall surely be opened to
  thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Draw thee water for a siege, and well secure thy
  strong-holds: enter into the clay, and be thou trodden in the chaff, make the
  fortifications stronger than brick. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  There the fire shall devour thee; the sword shall utterly destroy thee, it
  shall devour thee as the locust, and thou shalt be pressed down as a
  palmerworm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thou hast multiplied thy
  merchandise beyond the stars of heaven: the palmerworm has attacked it, and
  has flown away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Thy mixed multitude
  has suddenly departed as the grasshopper, as the locust perched on a hedge in
  a frosty day; the sun arises, and it flies off, and knows not its place: woe
  to them! <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thy shepherds have
  slumbered, the Assyrian king has laid low thy mighty men: thy people departed
  to the mountains, and there was none to receive them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> There is no healing for thy bruise; thy wound has
  rankled: all that hear the report of thee shall clap their hands against
  thee; for upon whom has not thy wickedness passed continually?
