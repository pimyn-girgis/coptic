  <h3 id="epistle_of_st._james1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  James, (the) servant of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes
  who are in the dispersion, hail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Be in
  all joy, my brethren, if ye should fall into various temptations;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> knowing that the proof of your faith
  worked [a] patience, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But [the]
  patience--let a complete work be in it (sc. patience), that ye may be
  complete and sound, and that ye may not be deficient of anything.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if there is one among you
  deficient of wisdom, let him ask from God, who giveth to all simply,
  reproaching not; and it shall be given to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But let him ask in [a] faith, doubting not. For he
  who doubteth was as the waves of the sea, the wind taking them and bringing
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For let not that man think to
  himself, that he will take anything from the Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but the man who doubteth is unsteady on all his
  ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But let the brother who is in
  humble (position) boast himself in his exaltation: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but the rich in his humiliation: because as a
  flower of [a] grass he will pass (away). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For (the) sun arose with the scorching heat and
  dried the grass; and its flower fell off, but (the) beauty of its face
  perished: thus also the rich in all his ways will wither. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Blessed is the man who will endure in a
  temptation, because, should he be a chosen (one), he will receive the crown
  of (the) life, which he promised to them who will love him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let not any one say, being tempted, that it is
  God who tempteth me: for God tempteth not in evil things, but he (pron.)
  tempteth not any one: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but each one is
  being tempted by his own lust drawing him and enticing him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Then the lust should it conceive bringeth forth
  (the) sin: but (the) sin should it be completed begetteth (the) death.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Go not astray, my brethren, my
  beloved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> All good gifts and all
  complete gifts are from above, coming below from the Father of the lights,
  with whom there is not change, nor a form of a shadow which passed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He wished, he begat us in (the) word
  of the truth, to cause us to be a firstfruit of his creatures. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But we know, my brethren, my beloved. But let
  every man be in haste about to hear, slow about to speak, slow about to be
  angry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For (the) anger of (the) man
  worketh not the righteousness of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  Therefore lay down all filthiness and (the) abundance of [the] malice, in [a]
  meekness receive the word, newly grown up, for which it is possible to save
  your souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Be doers of the word, and
  not listeners only, otherwise ye are deceiving your own selves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He who is a listener of the word, and not a
  worker, [this] was like to a man who beheld (the) face of his birth in a
  mirror: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> for he beheld it, and he went
  away, and immediately he forgat the manner (of man) which he was being.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But he who gazed at (the) law which
  is complete of the freedom, and stayed in it, he is not (a) forgetful hearer,
  but (a) doer of the work, this (one) shall be blessed in that which he doeth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But he who thinketh that he is a
  server (of God), bridling not his tongue, but he deceived his heart, (the)
  service of this (one) is vain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But
  the pure service and unstained with God and the Father is this, to visit the
  orphans and the widows in their tribulation, to keep himself unspotted from
  the world.
  <h3 id="epistle_of_st._james2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  My brethren, have not the faith of (the) glory of our Lord Jesus Christ in a
  respect of persons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For if a man
  cometh into your synagogue wearing a gold ring on his finger, in (a) splendid
  raiment, but a poor (man) also entereth in (an) unwashed raiment;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and ye look upon him who weareth the
  splendid raiment, and say: Thou, sit thee here in a good place'; and ye say
  to the poor man also: 'Thou, stand there or sit here at (the) place of
  putting the feet.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Did you not put a
  distinction among yourselves, and ye become judges of (lit. in) evil
  thoughts? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Hear, my brethren, my
  beloved; was not God choosing the poor of the world, rich in the faith, and
  heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to them who will love him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But ye dishonour the poor (man). Is it
  not the rich who tyrannise you? And they (are those) who draw you to places
  of giving judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Are not they
  (those) who blaspheme the good name which was called over you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> If indeed ye fulfil the royal law according to the
  Scriptures: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,' ye do well:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If ye respect persons, ye work (the)
  sin; (the) law convicting you as transgressors of the law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For he who will keep (the) law, and fall in one
  (commandment), became guilty of them all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he who said: 'Thou shalt not commit
  adultery,' he (pron.) again said: 'Thou shalt not kill.' If thou committest
  not adultery, but killest, thou became transgressor of the law. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Speak thus and do thus, as about to be judged
  through (the) law of the freedom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For
  the judgement is without mercy to him who showed (lit. did) not the mercy:
  for (the) mercy boasteth itself over [the]. judgement. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> What is (the) profit, my brethren, if one say: 'I
  have faith,' but he hath not works? Is it possible that [the] faith should
  save him without the works? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But if
  there is a brother or a sister naked, and in want of (the) food of the day,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and one of you indeed say to them: Go
  in [a] peace, be warmed and satisfied'; and yet ye give not to them for (the)
  need of the body; what is the profit? <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  Thus [the] faith also, if there is not work in it, is dead by itself.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But one will say: Thou (pron.) hast
  [a] faith, but I (pron.) have works: show to me thy faith without the works,
  but I (pron.) will show to thee my faith from my works.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Thou (pron.) believest that God is one; thou
  doest well: the demons also believe, and they tremble. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But thou wishest to know, O (the) man, who art
  vain, that [the] faith without the works is dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Abraam our father was he not justified from the
  works, having offered Isaak his son upon the altar? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou seest that [the] faith was working with the
  works, and in the works [the] faith was completed; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and the Scripture was fulfilled: 'Abraam believed
  God; it was reckoned to him for [a] righteousness'; and he was called `(the)
  friend of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Ye see that the man
  was to be justified from the works, and not from [the] faith alone.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Thus again Raab the harlot--was not
  she justified from the works, having received the spies, and she helped them
  out by another way? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For as the body
  without the spirit is dead, thus [the] faith also without the works is dead.
  <h3 id="epistle_of_st._james3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that ye will receive a judgement.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For we all stumble many times. He who
  stumbleth not in a word, this is a perfect man, it being possible for him to
  bridle the whole body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> If we put (lit,
  give) bridle to the mouths of the horses, (it is) for them to obey us, and we
  drive their whole body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Behold the
  ships which are so great, driven by rough winds, are guided (lit. brought) by
  a little helm, whither the steersman will wish to direct (lit. give) his
  course. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thus also the tongue is a
  little member, and it speaketh great things, Behold, a little fire burneth a
  whole wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The tongue also is a fire,
  (the) ornament of (the) iniquity. The tongue is among the members, and it
  defileth the whole body; it burneth the wheel of the birth, and it burneth by
  the Geenna. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For all natures of the
  beasts and the birds and the creeping things and those which are in the seas
  are tamed, and are subject to the nature of [the] humanity: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but the tongue itself there is not any man who can
  make it subject; it is an unsettled (thing), being evil, being full of poison
  of (the) death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> We blessed God and the
  Father by it; and from it we revile [the] men, whom God made like to him:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> from the same mouth come forth the
  blessing and the cursing. That which is not right to be, my brethren, (is it)
  that these things should be thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Doth the fountain pour forth that which is sweet and that which is salt from
  the same one opening? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Is it possible,
  my brethren, for the fig-tree that it should produce olives, or a vine that
  it should produce figs? Thus that which is sweet shall not produce a salt
  water. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Who is wise and understanding
  among you? Let him show to us his works from his good walk (of life) in [a]
  meekness of [a] wisdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if there
  is bitter jealousy among you and strife in your hearts, boast not yourselves
  and speak (not) falsehood against the truth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> This wisdom was not coming down from above, but
  is that of (the) earth, psychic, demon-form. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For where there is jealousy or strife, (the)
  confusion is there and every evil work. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But the wisdom which is from above, first indeed
  it is pure, then it is peacemaking, it is fair, full of mercy, and good
  fruit, it is not self-judging, it is not hypocritical. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But (the) fruit of [the] peace and [the]
  righteousness is sown in [a] peace to them who make [the] peace.
  <h3 id="epistle_of_st._james4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Whence is coming war, and whence is coming dispute among you? Is it not from
  these, from your pleasures which are armed in your members? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Ye lust, and ye have not: ye kill, and ye are
  jealous, it is not possible for you to obtain: ye strive, ye make war; and ye
  have not, because that ye ask not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ye
  ask, and ye receive not, because ye ask badly, That from your pleasures ye
  may spend. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> [The] adulterers, ye know
  not that the friendship of the world is [an] enmity of God. But he. who
  wisheth to be friend unto the world will become enemy unto God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Or know ye not that the Scripture saith, In vain,
  or in [an] Scriptureenvy, the spirit which dwelleth in us yearneth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But he giveth [a] great grace.
  Therefore he saith God opposeth the proud, but to them who are humble he will
  give [a] grace.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Subject yourselves
  then to God, but oppose the devil; he shall flee from you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Draw near to God; he shall draw near to you.
  Cleanse your hands, [the] sinners; cleanse your hearts, (ye) double-minded.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Be miserable, and mourn, and weep:
  your laughter--let it turn to [a] mourning, and your joy to [a] sadness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Humiliate yourselves before God, that
  he may exalt you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Speak not against
  one another, my brethren. For he who speaketh against his brother, or is
  judging his brother, spoke against the law, and he judged the law: but if
  thou judgest the law, then, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For one is the lawgiver and judge,
  for whom it is possible to save and to destroy: who art thou, namely thou
  (lit. he), who judgest thy neighbour? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Go to now ye (lit. they) who say: To-day or to-morrow we shall (lit. will) go
  to this city and spend a year there, and trade and find gain,' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> they who know not what will happen on the (lit.
  his) morrow. For what is your life? It was as a vapour, appearing for a
  little, then it perisheth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Instead ye
  (should) say: 'If the Lord should wish, and we live, we shall (lit. will) do
  this or that.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Now ye boast
  yourselves in your arrogancies: but all such boastings are evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He who knoweth a good (thing) to do it, and doeth
  it not, it is a sin to him.
  <h3 id="epistle_of_st._james5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span>
  Go to now, [the] rich, weep, crying out for your miseries which come upon
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Your wealth corrupted, your
  clothes (the) moth ate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Your gold and
  your silver rusted; and their rust will be to you for a witness, and it will
  eat up your flesh (plur.) as a fire. Ye gather up in last days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Behold, (the) hire of the labourers who reaped
  your fields, which was defrauded by you, crieth out: and the voices of the
  reapers went into (the) ears of the Lord Sabaōth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Ye were in delight upon (the) earth, and ye are
  luxurious; and ye nourish your hearts unto (the) day of (the) slaughter.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Ye judged, and ye kill the righteous
  (one); he opposeth you not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Be
  longsuffering, my brethren, until (the) coming of the Lord. Behold, the
  husbandman is looking out forward to the precious fruit of (the) earth, and
  he is longsuffering for it, until he receive the first fruit and the last.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Be ye also longsuffering, and confirm
  your hearts; because the coming of the Lord drew near. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Murmur not against one another, my brethren, that
  ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth at the doors. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Take a pattern for you, my brethren, of [the]
  suffering and [the] longsuffering of the prophets, who spoke in (the) name of
  the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Lo, we call them blessed
  who endure. Ye heard of the patience of Jōb, and ye saw the finishing of the
  Lord, that the Lord is very full of pity, and is long-suffering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> First indeed of everything, my brethren, swear
  not, neither by (the) heaven, nor by (the) earth, nor any other oath: but let
  your word be a yea yea, nay nay, that ye may not be under a judgement.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But if there is one suffering among
  you, let him pray. He who is in delight of heart, let him sing praise.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But if there is one sick among you,
  let him call the presbyters of the church; and let them pray over him, having
  anointed him with [an] oil in (the) name of the Lord: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and (the) prayer of (the) faith shall save him
  who is pained, and the Lord shall raise him (up); Even if he committed sins,
  they shall be forgiven him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Confess
  then your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be
  healed. There is a great power in (the) prayer of the righteous (man), which
  worketh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Elias was also a man,
  suffering as we, and he prayed a prayer for (the) heaven not to rain; and it
  rained not upon the earth for three years and six months. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he prayed again, (the) heaven gave a rain,
  and (the) earth sprouted, it gave its fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> My brethren, if one among you should go astray
  from the truth, and one make him return; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> let him who will make return a sinner from (the)
  way of his error know, that he will save his soul from (the) death, and he
  will cover over many sins.
