  <h3 id="job1">1</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> There was a certain man in the land
  of Ausis, whose name was Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous,
  and godly, abstaining from everything evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he had seven sons and three daughters.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And his cattle consisted of seven
  thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five
  hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great household, and he had a
  great husbandry on the earth; and that man was most noble of the men of the
  east. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And his sons visiting one
  another prepared a banquet every day, taking with them also their three
  sisters to eat and drink with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  And when the days of the banquet were completed, Job sent and purified them,
  having risen up in the morning, and offered sacrifices for them, according to
  their number, and one calf for a sin-offering for their souls: for Job said,
  Lest peradventure my sons have thought evil in their minds against God. Thus,
  then Job did continually. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And it came
  to pass on a day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the
  Lord, and the devil came with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And the Lord said to the devil, Whence art thou come? And the devil answered
  the Lord, and said, I am come from compassing the earth, and walking up and
  down in the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the Lord said
  to him, Hast thou diligently considered my servant Job, that there is none
  like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from
  everything evil? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then the devil
  answered, and said before the Lord, Does Job worship the Lord for nothing?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Hast thou not made a hedge about him,
  and about his household, and all his possessions round about? and hast thou
  not blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle upon the land?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But put forth thine hand, and touch
  all that he has: verily he will bless thee to thy face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I give
  into thine hand all that he has, but touch not himself. So the devil went out
  from the presence of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And it
  came to pass on a certain day, that Job’s sons and his daughters were
  drinking wine in the house of their elder brother. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and
  said to him, The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding
  near them; <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and the spoilers came and
  took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I having
  escaped alone am come to tell thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job,
  Fire has fallen from heaven, and burnt up the sheep, and devoured the
  shepherds like wise; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> While he was yet speaking, there came
  another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies
  against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and slew the
  servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> While he is yet speaking, another
  messenger comes, saying to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating
  and drinking with their elder brother, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> suddenly a great wind came on from the desert,
  and caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon thy
  children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> So Job arose, and rent his
  garments, and shaved the hair of his head, and fell on the earth, and
  worshipped, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and said, I myself came
  forth naked from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord
  gave, the Lord has taken away: as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it come
  to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> In all these events that befell him Job sinned
  not at all before the Lord, and did not impute folly to God.</p>

  <h3 id="job2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it came to pass on a certain
  day, that the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came
  among them to stand before the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  And the Lord, said to the devil, Whence comest thou? Then the devil said
  before the Lord, I am come from going through the world, and walking about
  the whole earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the Lord said to
  the devil, Hast thou then observed my servant Job, that there is none of men
  upon the earth like him, a harmless, true, blameless, godly man, abstaining
  from all evil? and he yet cleaves to innocence, whereas thou has told me to
  destroy his substance without cause? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And the devil answered and said to the Lord, Skin for skin, all that a man
  has will he give as a ransom for his life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Nay, but put forth thine hand, and touch his bones
  and his flesh: verily he will bless thee to thy face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I deliver
  him up to thee; only save his life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> So
  the devil went out from the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from his feet
  to his head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he took a potsherd to
  scrape away the discharge, and sat upon a dung-heap outside the city.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And when much time had passed, his
  wife said to him, How long wilt thou hold out, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9a)</span> Behold, I wait yet a little while, expecting the
  hope of my deliverance? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9b)</span> for, behold,
  thy memorial is abolished from the earth, even thy sons and daughters, the
  pangs and pains of my womb which I bore in vain with sorrows; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9c)</span> and thou thyself sittest down to spend the nights
  in the open air among the corruption of worms, and I am a wanderer and a
  servant from place to place and house to house, waiting for the setting of
  the sun, that I may rest from my labours and my pangs which now beset me:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9d)</span> but say some word against the Lord,
  and die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But he looked on her, and
  said to her, Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have
  received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil
  things? In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not at all with
  his lips before God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Now his three
  friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him, came to him each
  from his own country: Eliphaz the king of the Thaemans, Baldad sovereign of
  the Saucheans, Sophar king of he Minaeans: and they came to him with one
  accord, to comfort and to visit him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him; and they cried
  with a loud voice, and wept, and rent every one his garment, and sprinkled
  dust upon their heads, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and they sat
  down beside him seven days and seven nights, and no one of them spoke; for
  they saw that his affliction was dreadful and very great.</p>

  <h3 id="job3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After this Job opened his mouth,
  and cursed his day, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Let the day perish in which I was
  born, and that night in which they said, Behold a man-child! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Let that night be darkness, and let not the Lord
  regard it from above, neither let light come upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But let darkness and the shadow of death seize it;
  let blackness come upon it; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> let that
  day and night be cursed, let darkness carry them away; let it not come into
  the days of the year, neither let it be numbered with the days of the months.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But let that night be pain, and let
  not mirth come upon it, nor joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  let him that curses that day curse it, even he that is ready to attack the
  great whale. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Let the stars of that
  night be darkened; let it remain dark, and not come into light; and let it
  not see the morning star arise: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  because it shut not up the gates of my mother’s womb, for so it would have
  removed sorrow from my eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For why
  died I not in the belly? and why did I not come forth from the womb and die
  immediately? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and why did the knees
  support me? and why did I suck the breasts? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now I should have lain down and been quiet, I
  should have slept and been at rest, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  with kings and councillors of the earth, who gloried in their swords;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> or with rulers, whose gold was
  abundant, who filled their houses with silver: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> or I should have been as an untimely birth
  proceeding from his mother’s womb, or as infants who never saw light.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> There the ungodly have burnt out the
  fury of rage; there the wearied in body rest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the men of old time have together ceased to
  hear the exactor’s voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The small
  and great are there, and the servant that feared his lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For why is light given to those who are in
  bitterness, and life to those souls which are in griefs? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> who desire death, and obtain it not, digging for
  it as for treasures; <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> and would be
  very joyful if they should gain it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  Death is rest to such a man, for God has hedged him in. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For my groaning comes before my food, and I weep
  being beset with terror. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For the
  terror of which I meditated has come upon me, and that which I had feared has
  befallen me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I was not at peace, nor
  quiet, nor had I rest; yet wrath came upon me.</p>

  <h3 id="job4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite
  answered and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hast thou been
  often spoken to in distress? but who shall endure the force of thy words?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For whereas thou hast instructed many,
  and hast strengthened the hands of the weak one, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and hast supported the failing with words, and
  hast imparted courage to feeble knees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Yet now that pain has come upon thee, and touched thee, thou art troubled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Is not thy fear founded in folly, thy
  hope also, and the mischief of thy way? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember then who has perished, being pure? or
  when were the true-hearted utterly destroyed? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Accordingly as I have seen men ploughing barren
  places, and they that sow them will reap sorrows for themselves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They shall perish by the command of the Lord, and
  shall be utterly consumed by the breath of his wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The strength of the lion, and the voice of the
  lioness, and the exulting cry of serpents are quenched. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The old lion has perished for want of food, and
  the lions’ whelps have forsaken one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But if there had been any truth in thy words,
  none of these evils would have befallen thee. Shall not mine ear receive
  excellent revelations from him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  as when terror falls upon men, with dread and a sound in the night,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> horror and trembling seized me, and
  caused all my bones greatly to shake. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And a spirit came before my face; and my hair and flesh quivered.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I arose and perceived it not: I
  looked, and there, was no form before my eyes: but I only heard a breath and
  a voice, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> What, shall a mortal
  be pure before the Lord? or a man be blameless in regard to his works?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Whereas he trust not in his servants,
  and perceives perverseness in his angels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But as for them that dwell in houses of clay, of
  whom we also are formed of the same clay, he smites them like a moth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And from the morning to evening they
  no longer exist: they have perished, because they cannot help themselves.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For he blows upon them, and they are
  withered: they have perished for lack of wisdom.</p>

  <h3 id="job5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But call, if any one will hearken
  to thee, or if thou shalt see any of the holy angels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For wrath destroys the foolish one, and envy slays
  him that has gone astray. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I have
  seen foolish ones taking root: but suddenly their habitation was devoured.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Let their children be far from safety,
  and let them be crushed at the doors of vile men, and let there be no
  deliverer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For what they have
  collected, the just shall eat; but they shall not be delivered out of
  calamities: let their strength be utterly exhausted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For labour cannot by any means come out of the
  earth, nor shall trouble spring out of the mountains: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> yet man is born to labour, and even so the vulture’
   s young seek the high places. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Nevertheless I will beseech the Lord, and will call upon the Lord, the
  sovereign of all; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> who does great
  things and untraceable, glorious things also, and marvellous, of which there
  is no number: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> who gives rain upon the
  earth, sending water on the earth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  who exalts the lowly, and raises up them that are lost: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> frustrating the counsels of the crafty, and their
  hands shall not perform the truth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  who takes the wise in their wisdom, and subverts the counsel of the crafty
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> In the day darkness shall come upon
  them, and let them grope in the noon-day even as in the night: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and let them perish in war, and let the weak
  escape from the hand of the mighty. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And let the weak have hope, but the mouth of the unjust be stopped.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But blessed is the man whom the Lord
  has reproved; and reject not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> for he causes a man to be in pain,
  and restores him again: he smites, and his hands heal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Six time he shall deliver thee out of distresses:
  and in the seventh harm shall not touch thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and
  in war he shall free thee from the power of the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He shall hide thee from the scourge of the
  tongue: and thou shalt not be afraid of coming evils. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the
  lawless: and thou shalt not be afraid of wild beasts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the wild beasts of the field shall be at
  peace with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Then shalt thou know
  that thy house shall be at peace, and the provision for thy tabernacle shall
  not fail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou shalt know that
  thy seed shall be abundant; and thy children shall be like the herbage of the
  field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And thou shalt come to the
  grave like ripe corn reaped in its season, or as a heap of the corn-flour
  collected in proper time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Behold, we
  have thus sought out these matters; these are what we have heard: but do thou
  reflect with thyself, if thou hast done anything wrong.</p>

  <h3 id="job6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Oh that one would indeed weigh the
  wrath that is upon me, and take up my griefs in a balance together!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And verily they would be heavier than
  the sand by the seashore: but, as it seems, my words are vain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose
  violence drinks up my blood: whenever I am going to speak, they pierce me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> What then? will the wild ass bray for
  nothing, if he is not seeking food? or again, will the ox low at the manger,
  when he has a fodder? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Shall bread be
  eaten without salt? or again, is there taste in empty words? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For my wrath cannot cease; for I perceive my food
  as the smell of a lion to be loathsome. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For oh that he would grant my desire, and my
  petition might come, and the Lord would grant my hope! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not
  utterly destroy me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let the grave be
  my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped: I will not shrink from it;
  for I have not denied the holy words of my God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For what is my strength, that I continue? what is
  my time, that my soul endures? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Is my
  strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Or have I not trusted in him? but help is far
  from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Mercy has rejected me; and
  the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My nearest relations have not regarded me; they
  have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They who used to reverence me, now have come
  against me like snow or congealed ice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is
  not known what it was. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Thus I also
  have been deserted of all; and I am ruined, and become an outcast.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Behold the ways of the Thaemanites,
  ye that mark the paths of the Sabaeans. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> They too that trust in cities and riches shall
  come to shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But ye also have come
  to me without pity; so that beholding my wound ye are afraid. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> What? have I made any demand of you? or do I ask
  for strength from you, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> to deliver me
  from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Teach ye me, and I will be silent: if in anything
  I have erred, tell me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But as it
  seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Neither will your reproof cause
  me to cease my words, for neither will I endure the sound of your speech.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Even because ye attack the
  fatherless, and insult your friend. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Sit down now, and let there not be
  unrighteousness; and unite again with the just. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For there is no injustice in my tongue; and does
  not my throat meditate understanding?</p>

  <h3 id="job7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Is not the life of man upon earth a
  state of trial? and his existence as that of a hireling by the day?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Or as a servant that fears his master,
  and one who has grasped a shadow? or as a hireling waiting for his pay?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So have I also endured months of
  vanity, and nights of pain have been appointed me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Whenever I lie down, I say, When will it be day?
  and whenever I rise up, again I say when will it be evening? and I am full of
  pains from evening to morning. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And my
  body is covered with loathsome worms; and I waste away, scraping off clods of
  dust from my eruption. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And my life is
  lighter than a word, and has perished in vain hope. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Remember then that my life is breath, and mine eye
  shalt not yet again see good. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The eye
  of him that sees me shall not see me again: thine eyes are upon me, and I am
  no more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I am as a cloud that is
  cleared away from the sky: for if a man go down to the grave, he shall not
  come up again: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and he shall surely
  not return to his own house, neither shall his place know him any more.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then neither will I refrain my mouth:
  I will speak being in distress; being in anguish I will disclose the
  bitterness of my soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Am I a sea, or
  a serpent, that thou hast set a watch over me? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I said that my bed should comfort me, and I would
  privately counsel with myself on my couch. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Thou scarest me with dreams, and dost terrify me
  with visions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Thou wilt separate life
  from my spirit; and yet keep my bones from death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For I shall not live for ever, that I should
  patiently endure: depart from me, for my life is vain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For what is man, that thou hast magnified him? or
  that thou givest heed to him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Wilt
  thou visit him till the morning, and judge him till the time of rest?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> How long dost thou not let me alone,
  nor let me go, until I shall swallow down my spittle? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If I have sinned, what shall I be able to do, O
  thou that understandest the mind of men? why hast thou made me as thine
  accuser, and why am I a burden to thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Why hast thou not forgotten my iniquity, and
  purged my sin? but now I shall depart to the earth; and in the morning I am
  no more.</p>

  <h3 id="job8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Baldad the Sauchite answered,
  and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> How long wilt thou speak
  these things, how long shall the breath of thy mouth be abundant in words?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Will the Lord be unjust when he
  judges; or will he that has made all things pervert justice? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> If thy sons have sinned before him, he has cast
  them away because of their transgression. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But be thou early in prayer to the Lord Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> If thou art pure and true, he will
  hearken to thy supplication, and will restore to thee the habitation of
  righteousness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Though then thy
  beginning should be small, yet thy end should be unspeakably great.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For ask of the former generation, and
  search diligently among the race of our fathers: (for we are of yesterday,
  and know nothing; for our life upon the earth is a shadow:) <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> shall not these teach thee, and report to thee,
  and bring out words from their heart? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  Does the rush flourish without water, or shall the flag grow up without
  moisture? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When it is yet on the root,
  and though it has not been cut down, does not any herb wither before it has
  received moisture? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Thus then shall be
  the end of all that forget the Lord: for the hope of the ungodly shall
  perish. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For his house shall be
  without inhabitants, and his tent shall prove a spider’s web. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If he should prop up his house, it shall not
  stand: and when he has taken hold of it, it shall not remain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For it is moist under the sun, and his branch
  shall come forth out of his dung-heap. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He lies down upon a gathering of stones, and
  shall live in the mist of flints. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> If
  God should destroy him, his place shall deny him. Hast thou not seen such
  things, <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> that such is the overthrow of
  the ungodly? and out of the earth another shall grow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the Lord will by no means reject the harmless
  man; but he will not receive any gift of the ungodly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he will fill with laughter the mouth of the
  sincere, and their lips with thanksgiving. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But their adversaries shall clothe themselves
  with shame; and the habitation of the ungodly shall perish.</p>

  <h3 id="job9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I know of a truth that it is so: for
  how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For if he would enter into judgment with him, God
  would not hearken to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges of a
  thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For he is wise in mind, and
  mighty, and great: who has hardened himself against him and endured?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Who wears out the mountains, and men
  know it not: who overturns them in anger. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Who shakes the earth under heaven from its
  foundations, and its pillars totter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and he seals up the stars.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Who alone has stretched out the
  heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who makes Pleias, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and
  the chambers of the south. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Who does
  great and unsearchable things; glorious also and excellent things,
  innumerable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If ever he should go
  beyond me, I shall not see him: if he should pass by me, neither thus have I
  known it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If he would take away, who
  shall turn him back? or who shall say to him, What hast thou done?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For if he has turned away his anger,
  the whales under heaven have stooped under him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Oh then that he would hearken to me, or judge my
  cause. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For though I be righteous, he
  will not hearken to me: I will intreat his judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if I should call and he should not hearken, I
  cannot believe that he has listened to my voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let him not crush me with a dark storm: but he
  has made by bruises many without cause. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For he suffers me not to take breath, but he has
  filled me with bitterness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For indeed
  he is strong in power: who then shall resist his judgment? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will
  be profane: and though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For even if I have sinned, I know it
  not in my soul: but my life is taken away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Wherefore I said, Wrath slays the great and
  mighty man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the worthless die,
  but the righteous are laughed to scorn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For they are delivered into the hands of the
  unrighteous man: he covers the faces of the judges of the earth: but if it be
  not he, who is it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But my life is
  swifter than a post: my days have fled away, and they knew it not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Or again, is there a trace of their
  path left by ships? or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks its prey?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And if I should say, I will forget to
  speak, I will bow down my face and groan; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> I quake in all my limbs, for I know that thou
  wilt not leave me alone as innocent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  But since I am ungodly, why have I not died? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For if I should wash myself with snow, and purge
  myself with pure hands, <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> thou hadst
  thoroughly plunged me in filth, and my garment had abhorred me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> For thou art not man like me, with whom I could
  contend, that we might come together to judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Would that he our mediator were present, and a
  reprover, and one who should hear the cause between both. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Let him remove his rod from me, and let not his
  fear terrify me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> so shall I not be
  afraid, but I will speak: for I am not thus conscious of guilt.</p>

  <h3 id="job10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Weary in my soul, I will pour my
  words with groans upon him: I will speak being straitened in the bitterness
  of my soul. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I will say to the
  Lord, Do not teach me to be impious; and wherefore hast thou thus judged me?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Is it good before thee if I be
  unrighteous? for thou hast disowned the work of thy hands, and attended to
  the counsel of the ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Or dost
  thou see as a mortal sees? or wilt thou look as a man sees? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Or is thy life human, or thy years the years of a
  man, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> that thou hast enquired into mine
  iniquity, and searched out my sins? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  For thou knowest that I have not committed iniquity: but who is he that can
  deliver out of thy hands? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thy hands
  have formed me and made me; afterwards thou didst change thy mind, and smite
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Remember that thou hast made me as
  clay, and thou dost turn me again to earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Hast thou not poured me out like milk, and
  curdled me like cheese? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And thou
  didst clothe me with skin and flesh, and frame me with bones and sinews.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thou didst bestow upon me life
  and mercy, and thy oversight has preserved my spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Having these things in thyself, I know that thou
  canst do all things; for nothing is impossible with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if I should sin, thou watchest me; and thou
  hast not cleared me from iniquity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Or
  if I should be ungodly, woe is me: and if I should be righteous, I cannot
  lift myself up, for I am full of dishonour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For I am hunted like a lion for slaughter; for
  again thou hast changed and art terribly destroying me; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> renewing against me my torture: and thou hast
  dealt with me in great anger, and thou hast brought trials upon me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Why then didst thou bring me out of
  the womb? and why did I not die, and no eye see me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and I become as if I had not been? for why was I
  not carried from the womb to the grave? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Is not the time of my life short? suffer me to
  rest a little, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> before I go whence I
  shall not return, to a land of darkness and gloominess; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> to a land of perpetual darkness, where there is
  no light, neither can any one see the life of mortals.</p>

  <h3 id="job11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Sophar the Minaean answered
  and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> He that speaks much, should
  also hear on the other side: or does the fluent speaker think himself to be
  righteous? blessed is the short lived offspring of woman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Be not a speaker of many words; for is there none
  to answer thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For say not, I am pure
  in my works, and blameless before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  But oh that the Lord would speak to thee, and open his lips to thee!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then shall he declare to thee the
  power of wisdom; for it shall be double of that which is with thee: and then
  shalt thou know, that a just recompence of thy sins has come to thee from the
  Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wilt thou find out the traces of
  the Lord? or hast thou come to the end of that which the Almighty has made?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Heaven is high; and what wilt thou do?
  and there are deeper things than those in hell; what dost thou know?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Or longer than the measure of the
  earth, or the breadth of the sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  if he should overthrow all things, who will say to him, What hast thou done?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he knows the works of
  transgressors; and when he sees wickedness, he will not overlook it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But man vainly buoys himself up with
  words; and a mortal born of woman is like an ass in the desert. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For if thou hast made thine heart pure, and
  liftest up thine hands towards him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  if there is any iniquity in thy hands, put if far from thee, and let not
  unrighteousness lodge in thy habitation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For thus shall thy countenance shine again, as
  pure water; and thou shalt divest thyself of uncleanness, and shalt not fear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And thou shalt forget trouble, as a
  wave that has passed by; and thou shalt not be scared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And thy prayer shall be as the morning star, and
  life shall arise to thee as from the noonday. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And thou shalt be confident, because thou hast
  hope; and peace shall dawn to thee from out of anxiety and care. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For thou shalt be at ease, and there shall be no
  one to fight against thee; and many shall charge, and make supplication to
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But safety shall fail them; for
  their hope is destruction, and the eyes of the ungodly shall waste away.</p>

  <h3 id="job12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> So then ye alone are men, and wisdom
  shall die with you? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But I also have a
  heart as well as you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For a righteous
  and blameless man has become a subject for mockery. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For it had been ordained that he should fall under
  others at the appointed time, and that his houses should be spoiled by
  transgressors: let not however any one trust that, being evil, he shall be
  held guiltless, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> even as many as
  provoke the Lord, as if there were indeed to be no inquisition made of them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But ask now the beasts, if they may
  speak to thee; and the birds of the air, if they may declare to thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Tell the earth, if it may speak to
  thee: and the fishes of the sea shall explain to thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who then has not known in all these things, that
  the hand of the Lord has made them? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Whereas the life of all living things is in his hand, and the breath of every
  man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the ear tries words, and the
  palate tastes meats. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> In length of
  time is wisdom, and in long life knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> With him are wisdom and power, with him counsel
  and understanding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> If he should cast
  down, who will build up? if he should shut up against man, who shall open?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If he should withhold the water, he
  will dry the earth: and if he should let it loose, he overthrows and destroys
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> With him are strength and power:
  he has knowledge and understanding. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  He leads counsellors away captive, and maddens the judges of the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He seats kings upon thrones, and
  girds their loins with a girdle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He
  sends away priests into captivity, and overthrows the mighty ones of the
  earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> He changes the lips of the
  trusty, and he knows the understanding of the elders. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He pours dishonour upon princes, and heals the
  lowly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Revealing deep things out of
  darkness: and he has brought into light the shadow of death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Causing the nations to wander, and destroying
  them: overthrowing the nations, and leading them away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Perplexing the minds of the princes of the earth:
  and he causes them to wander in a way, they have not known, saying, (25) Let
  them grope in darkness, and let there be no light, and let them wander as a
  drunken man.</p>

  <h3 id="job13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Behold, mine eye has seen these

  And I know all that ye too know; and I have not less understanding than you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Nevertheless I will speak to the Lord,
  and I will reason before him, if he will. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But ye are all bad physicians, and healers of
  diseases. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But would that ye were

  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But hear ye the reasoning of my mouth, and attend
  to the judgment of my lips. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Do ye not
  speak before the Lord, and utter deceit before him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Or will ye draw back? nay do, ye yourselves be
  judges. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For it were well if he would
  thoroughly search you: for though doing all things in your power ye should
  attach yourselves to him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he will not
  reprove you at all the less: but if moreover ye should secretly respect
  persons, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> shall not his whirlpool
  sweep you round, and terror from him fall upon you? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And your glorying shall prove in the end to you
  like ashes, and your body like a body of clay. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Be silent, that I may speak, and cease from mine
  anger, <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> while I may take my flesh in
  my teeth, and put my life in my hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Though the Mighty One should lay hand upon me, forasmuch as he has begun,
  verily I will speak, and plead before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And this shall turn to me for salvation; for
  fraud shall have no entrance before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Hear, hear ye my words, for I will declare in

  judgment: I know that I shall appear evidently just. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> For who is he that shall plead with me, that I
  should now be silent, and expire? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But
  grant me two things: then I will not hide myself from thy face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Withhold thine hand from me: and let not thy fear
  terrify me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Then shalt thou call, and

  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> How many are my sins and my
  transgressions? teach me what they are. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Wherefore hidest thou thyself from me, and
  deemest me thine enemy? <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Wilt thou be
  startled at me, as at a leaf shaken by the wind? or wilt thou set thyself
  against me as against grass borne upon the breeze? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> for thou hast written evil things against me, and
  thou hast compassed me with the sins of my youth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And thou hast placed my foot in the stocks; and
  thou hast watched all my works, and hast penetrated my heels. <span style=

  <h3 id="job14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For a mortal born of a woman is
  short lived, and full of wrath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Or he
  falls like a flower that has bloomed; and he departs like a shadow, and
  cannot continue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Hast thou not taken
  account even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment before thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For who shall be pure from
  uncleanness? not even one; <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> if even his
  life should be but one day upon the earth: and his months are numbered by
  him: thou hast appointed him for a time, and he shall by no means exceed it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Depart from him, that he may be quiet,
  and take pleasure in his life, though as a hireling. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For there is hope for a tree, even if it should be
  cut down, that it shall blossom again, and its branch shall not fail.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For though its root should grow old in
  the earth, and its stem die in the rock; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> it will blossom from the scent of water, and will
  produce a crop, as one newly planted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  But a man that has died is utterly gone; and when a mortal has fallen, he is
  no more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the sea wastes in length
  of time, and a river fails and is dried up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And man that has lain down in death shall
  certainly not rise again till the heaven be dissolved, and they shall not
  awake from their sleep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For oh that
  thou hadst kept me in the grave, and hadst hidden me until thy wrath should
  cease, and thou shouldest set me a time in which thou wouldest remember me!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For if a man should die, shall he
  live again, having accomplished the days of his life? I will wait till I
  exist again? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Then shalt thou call,
  and I will hearken to thee: but do not thou reject the work of thine hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But thou hast numbered my devices:
  and not one of my sins shall escape thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> An thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a
  bag, and marked if I have been guilty of any transgression unawares.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And verily a mountain falling will
  utterly be destroyed, and a rock shall be worn out of its place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The waters wear the stones, and waters falling
  headlong overflow a heap of the earth: and thou destroyest the hope of man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou drivest him to an end, and he is
  gone: thou settest thy face against him, and sendest him away; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and though his children be multiplied, he knows
  it not; and if they be few, he is not aware. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But his flesh is in pain, and his soul
  mourns.</p>

  <h3 id="job15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite
  answered and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Will a wise man
  give for answer a mere breath of wisdom? and does he fill up the pain of his
  belly, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> reasoning with improper
  sayings, and with words wherein is no profit? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hast not thou moreover cast off fear, and
  accomplished such words before the Lord? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thou art guilty by the words of thy mouth, neither
  hast thou discerned the words of the mighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Let thine own mouth, and not me, reprove thee: and
  thy lips shall testify against thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  What! art thou the first man that was born? or wert thou established before
  the hills? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Or hast thou heard the
  ordinance of the Lord? or has God used thee as his counsellor? and has wisdom
  come only to thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For what knowest
  thou, that, we know not? or what understandest thou, which we do not also?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Truly among us are both the old and
  very aged man, more advanced in days than thy father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Thou hast been scourged for but few of thy sins:
  thou hast spoken haughtily and extravagantly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> What has thine heart dared? or what have thine
  eyes aimed at, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> that thou hast vented
  thy rage before the Lord, and delivered such words from thy mouth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For who, being a mortal, is such that
  he shall be blameless? or, who that is born of a woman, that he should be
  just? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Forasmuch as he trusts not his
  saints; and the heaven is not pure before him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Alas then, abominable and unclean is man,
  drinking unrighteousness as a draught. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But I will tell thee, hearken to me; I will tell
  thee now what I have seen; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> things
  wise men say, and their fathers have not hidden. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> To them alone the earth was given, and no
  stranger came upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> All the life
  of the ungodly is spent in care, and the years granted to the oppressor are
  numbered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And his terror is in his
  ears: just when he seems to be at peace, his overthrow will come.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Let him not trust that he shall
  return from darkness, for he has been already made over to the power of the
  sword. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he has been appointed to
  be food for vultures; and he knows within himself that he is doomed to be a
  carcass: and a dark day shall carry him away as with a whirlwind.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Distress also and anguish shall come
  upon him: he shall fall as a captain in the first rank. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For he has lifted his hands against the Lord, and
  he has hardened his neck against the Almighty Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he has run against him with insolence, on the
  thickness of the back of his shield. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  For he has covered his face with his fat, and made layers of fat upon his
  thighs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And let him lodge in desolate
  cities, and enter into houses without inhabitant: and what they have
  prepared, others shall carry away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Neither shall he at all grow rich, nor shall his substance remain: he shall
  not cast a shadow upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  Neither shall he in any wise escape the darkness: let the wind blast his
  blossom, and let his flower fall off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Let him not think that he shall endure; for his end shall be vanity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> His harvest shall perish before the
  time, and his branch shall not flourish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And let him be gathered as the unripe grape
  before the time, and let him fall as the blossom of the olive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For death is the witness of an ungodly man, and
  fire shall burn the houses of them that receive gifts. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he shall conceive sorrows, and his end shall
  be vanity, and his belly shall bear deceit.</p>

  <h3 id="job16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I have heard many such things: poor
  comforters are ye all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> What! is there
  any reason in vain words? or what will hinder thee from answering?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I also will speak as ye do: if indeed
  your soul were in my soul’s stead, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  then would I insult you with words, and I would shake my head at you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And would there were strength in my
  mouth, and I would not spare the movement of my lips. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For if I should speak, I shall not feel the pain
  of my wound: and if I should be silent, how shall I be wounded the less?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But now he has made me weary, and a
  worn-out fool; and thou hast laid hold of me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> My falsehood has become a testimony, and has risen
  up against me: it has confronted me to my face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> In his anger he has cast me down; he has gnashed
  his teeth upon me: the weapons of his robbers have fallen upon me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He has attacked me with the keen
  glances of his eyes; with his sharp spear he has smitten me down upon my
  knees; and they have run upon me with one accord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For the Lord has delivered me into the hands of
  unrighteous men, and thrown me upon the ungodly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> When I was at peace he distracted me: he took me
  by the hair of the head, and plucked it out: he set me up as a mark.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> They surrounded me with spears,
  aiming at my reins: without sparing me they poured out my gall upon the
  ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They overthrew me with fall
  upon fall: they ran upon me in their might. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> They sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and my
  strength has been spent on the ground. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> My belly has been parched with wailing, and
  darkness is on my eyelids. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Yet there
  was no injustice in my hands, and my prayer is pure. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Earth, cover not over the blood of my flesh, and
  let my cry have no place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And now,
  behold, my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Let my supplication come to the Lord, and let
  mine eye weep before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Oh that a
  man might plead before the Lord, even as the son of man with his neighbor!
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But my years are numbered and their
  end come, and I shall go by the way by which I shall not return.</p>

  <h3 id="job17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I perish, carried away by the wind,
  and I seek for burial, and obtain it not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Who is this? let him join hands with me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Weary I intreat; and what have I done?
  and strangers have stolen my goods. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  For thou hast hid their heart from wisdom; therefore thou shalt not exalt
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He shall promise mischief to his
  companions: but their eyes have failed for their children. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But thou has made me a byword amount the nations,
  and I am become a scorn to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For
  my eyes are dimmed through pain; I have been grievously beset by all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Wonder has seized true men upon this;
  and let the just rise up against the transgressor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But let the faithful hold on his own way, and let
  him that is pure of hands take courage. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Howbeit, do ye all strengthen yourselves and come
  now, for I do not find truth in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  My days have passed in groaning, and my heart-strings are broken.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I have turned the night into day: the
  light is short because of darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  For if I remain, Hades is my habitation: and my bed has been made in
  darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have called upon death to
  be my father, and corruption to be my mother and sister. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Where then is yet my hope? or where shall I see
  my good? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Will they go down with me to
  Hades, or shall we go down together to the tomb?</p>

  <h3 id="job18">18</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Baldad the Sauchite answered
  and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> How long wilt thou continue?
  forbear, that we also may speak. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For
  wherefore have we been silent before thee like brutes? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Anger has possessed thee: for what if thou
  shouldest die; would the earth under heaven be desolate? or shall the
  mountains be overthrown from their foundations? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the light of the ungodly shall be quenched,
  and their flame shall not go up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> His
  light shall be darkness in his habitation, and his lamp shall be put out with
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Let the meanest of men spoil his
  goods, and let his counsel deceive him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> His foot also has been caught in a snare, and let
  it be entangled in a net. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And let
  snares come upon him: he shall strengthen those that thirst for his
  destruction. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> His snare is hid in the
  earth, and that which shall take him is by the path. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Let pains destroy him round about, and let many
  enemies come about him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> vex him with
  distressing hunger: and a signal destruction has been prepared for him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let the soles of his feet be
  devoured: and death shall consume his beauty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And let health be utterly banished from his
  tabernacle, and let distress seize upon him with a charge from the king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> It shall dwell in his tabernacle in
  his night: his excellency shall be sown with brimstone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> His roots shall be dried up from beneath, and his
  crop shall fall away from above. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let
  his memorial perish out of the earth, and his name shall be publicly cast
  out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Let one drive him from light
  into darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> He shall not be known
  among his people, nor his house preserved on the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But strangers shall dwell in his possessions: the
  last groaned for him, and wonder seized the first. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> These are the houses of the unrighteous, and this
  is the place of them that know not the Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="job19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> How long will ye vex my soul, and
  destroy me with words? only know that the Lord has dealt with me thus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Ye speak against me; ye do not feel
  for me, but bear hard upon me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Yea
  verily, I have erred in truth, (but the error abides with myself) in having
  spoken words which it was not right to speak; and my words err, and are
  unreasonable. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But alas! for ye magnify
  yourselves against me, and insult me with reproach. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Know then that it is the Lord that has troubled
  me, and has raised his bulwark against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Behold, I laugh at reproach; I will not speak: or
  I will cry out, but there is nowhere judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I am fenced round about, and can by no means
  escape: he has set darkness before my face. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he has stripped me of my glory, and has taken
  the crown from my head. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He has torn
  me around about, and I am gone: and he has cut off my hope like a tree.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he has dreadfully handled me in
  anger, and has counted me for an enemy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> His troops also came upon me with one accord,
  liars in wait compassed my ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My
  brethren have stood aloof from me; they have recognized strangers rather than
  me: and my friends have become pitiless. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> My nearest of kin have not acknowledged me, and
  they that knew my name, have forgotten me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> As for my household, and my maid-servants, I was
  a stranger before them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I called my
  servant, and he hearkened not; and my mouth intreated him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I besought my wife, and earnestly intreated
  the sons of my concubines. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But they
  rejected me for ever; whenever I rise up, they speak against me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They that saw me abhorred me: the very persons
  whom I had loved, rose up against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  My flesh is corrupt under my skin, and my bones are held in my teeth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Pity me, pity me, O friends; for it
  is the hand of the Lord that has touched me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Wherefore do ye persecute me as also the Lord
  does, and are not satisfied with my flesh? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For oh that my words were written, and that they
  were recorded in a book forever, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> with
  an iron pen and lead, or graven in the rocks! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For I know that he is eternal who is about to
  deliver me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and to raise up upon the
  earth my skin that endures these sufferings: for these things have been
  accomplished to me of the Lord; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> which
  I am conscious of in myself, which mine eye has seen, and not another, but
  all have been fulfilled to me in my bosom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But if ye shall also say, What shall we say
  before him, and so find the root of the matter in him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Do ye also beware of deceit: for wrath will come
  upon transgressors; and then shall they know where their substance is.</p>

  <h3 id="job20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Sophar the Minaean answered
  and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I did not suppose that thou
  wouldest answer thus: neither do ye understand more than I. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will hear my shameful reproach; and the spirit
  of my understanding answers me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hast
  thou not known these things of old, from the time that man was set upon the
  earth? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the mirth of the ungodly is
  a signal downfall, and the joy of transgressors is destruction: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> although his gifts should go up to heaven, and his
  sacrifice reach the clouds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> For when
  he shall seem to be now established, then he shall utterly perish: and they
  that knew him shall say, Where is he? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  Like a dream that has fled away, he shall not be found; and he has fled like
  a vision of the night. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The eye has
  looked upon him, but shall not see him again; and his place shall no longer
  perceive him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Let his inferiors
  destroy his children, and let his hands kindle the fire of sorrow.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> His bones have been filled with
  vigour of his youth, and it shall lie down with him in the dust. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Though evil be sweet in his mouth, though he will
  hide it under his tongue; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> though he
  will not spare it, and will not leave it, but will keep it in the midst of
  his throat: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> yet he shall not at all
  be able to help himself; the gall of an asp is in his belly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> His wealth unjustly collected shall be vomited
  up; a messenger of wrath shall drag him out of his house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And let him suck the poison of serpents, and let
  the serpent’s tongue slay him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Let
  him not see the milk of the pastures, nor the supplies of honey and butter.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He has laboured unprofitably and in
  vain, for wealth of which he shall not taste: it is as a lean thing, unfit
  for food, which he cannot swallow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  For he has broken down the houses of many mighty men: and he has plundered an
  habitation, though he built it not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  There is no security to his possessions; he shall not be saved by his desire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> There is nothing remaining of his
  provisions; therefore his goods shall not flourish. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But when he shall seem to be just satisfied, he
  shall be straitened; and all distress shall come upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If by any means he would fill his belly, let God
  send upon him the fury of wrath; let him bring a torrent of pains upon him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he shall by no means escape from
  the power of the sword; let the brazen bow wound him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And let the arrow pierce through his body; and
  let the stars be against his dwelling-place: let terrors come upon him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And let all darkness wait for him: a
  fire that burns not out shall consume him; and let a stranger plague his
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And let the heaven reveal his
  iniquities, and the earth rise up against him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Let destruction bring his house to an end; let a
  day of wrath come upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> This is
  the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of his goods
  appointed him by the all-seeing God.</p>

  <h3 id="job21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear ye, hear ye my words, that I may
  not have this consolation from you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Raise me, and I will speak; then ye shall not laugh me to scorn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> What! is my reproof of man? and why should I not
  be angry? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Look upon me, and wonder,
  laying your hand upon your cheek. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> For
  even when I remember, I am alarmed, and pains seize my flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wherefore do the ungodly live, and grow old even
  in wealth? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Their seed is according to
  their desire, and their children are in their sight. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Their houses are prosperous, neither have they any
  where cause for fear, neither is there a scourge from the Lord upon them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Their cow does not cast her calf, and
  their beast with young is safe, and does not miscarry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they remain as an unfailing flock, and their
  children play before them, taking up the psaltery and harp; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and they rejoice at the voice of a song.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they spend their days in wealth,
  and fall asleep in the rest of the grave. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Yet such a man says to the Lord, Depart from me;
  I desire not to know thy ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> What
  is the Mighty One, that we should serve him? and what profit is there that we
  should approach him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For their good
  things were in their hands, but he regards not the works of the ungodly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Nevertheless, the lamp of the ungodly
  also shall be put out, and destruction shall come upon them, and pangs of
  vengeance shall seize them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they
  shall be as chaff before the wind, or as dust which the storm has taken up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Let his substance fail to supply his
  children: God shall recompense him, and he shall know it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Let his eyes see his own destruction, and let him
  not be saved by the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For his
  desire is in his house with him, and the number of his months has been
  suddenly cut off. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Is it not the Lord
  who teaches understanding and knowledge? and does not he judge murders?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> One shall die in his perfect
  strength, and wholly at ease and prosperous; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and his inwards are full of fat, and his marrow
  is diffused throughout him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And
  another dies in bitterness of soul, not eating any good thing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But they lie down in the earth together, and
  corruption covers them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> So I know
  you, that ye presumptuously attack me: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> so that ye will say, Where is the house of the
  prince? and where is the covering of the tabernacles of the ungodly?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Ask those that go by the way, and do
  not disown their tokens. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For the
  wicked hastens to the day of destruction: they shall be led away for the day
  of his vengeance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Who will tell him
  his way to his face, whereas he has done it? who shall recompense him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he has been led away to the
  tombs, and he has watched over the heaps. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The stones of the valley have been sweet to him,
  and every man shall depart after him, and there are innumerable ones before
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> How then do ye comfort me in
  vain? whereas I have no rest from your molestation.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite
  answered and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Is it not the Lord
  that teaches understanding and knowledge? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For what matters it to the Lord, if thou wert
  blameless in thy works? or is it profitable that thou shouldest perfect thy
  way? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Wilt thou maintain and plead
  thine own cause? and will he enter into judgment with thee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Is not thy wickedness abundant, and thy sins
  innumerable? <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And thou hast taken
  security of thy brethren for nothing, and hast taken away the clothing of the
  naked. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Neither hast thou given water
  to the thirsty to drink, but hast taken away the morsel of the hungry.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And thou hast accepted the persons of
  some; and thou hast established those that were already settled on the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But thou hast sent widows away empty,
  and has afflicted orphans. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Therefore
  snares have compassed thee, and disastrous war has troubled thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The light has proved darkness to
  thee, and water has covered thee on thy lying down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Does not he that dwells in the high places
  observe? and has he not brought down the proud? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And thou has said, What does the Mighty One know?
  does he judge in the dark? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> A cloud is
  his hiding-place, and he shall not be seen; and he passes through the circle
  of heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Wilt thou not mark the old
  way, which righteous men have trodden? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> who were seized before their time: their
  foundations are as an overflowing stream. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Who say, What will the Lord do to us? or what
  will the Almighty bring upon us? <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Yet
  he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel for the wicked is
  far from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The righteous have seen
  it, and laughed, and the blameless one has derided them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Verily their substance has been utterly
  destroyed, and the fire shall devour what is left of their property.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Be firm, I pray thee, if thou canst
  endure; then thy fruit shall prosper. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And receive a declaration from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine
  heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And if thou shalt turn and
  humble thyself before the Lord, thou hast thus removed unrighteousness far
  from thy habitation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Thou shalt lay
  up for thyself treasure in a heap on the rock; and Sophir shall be as the
  rock of the torrent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> So the Almighty
  shall be thy helper from enemies, and he shall bring thee forth pure as
  silver that has been tried by fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Then shalt thou have boldness before the Lord, looking up cheerfully to
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he shall hear thee when
  thou prayest to him, and he shall grant thee power to pay thy vows.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he shall establish to thee again
  a habitation of righteousness and there shall be light upon thy paths.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Because thou hast humbled thyself;
  and thou shalt say, Man has behaved proudly, but he shall save him that is of
  lowly eyes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> He shall deliver the
  innocent, and do thou save thyself by thy pure hands.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Yea, I know that pleading is out of my
  reach; and his hand has been made heavy upon my groaning. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Who would then know that I might find him, and
  come to an end of the matter? <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I
  would plead my own cause, and he would fill my mouth with arguments.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I would know the remedies which he
  would speak to me, and I would perceive what he would tell me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Though he should come on me in his great strength,
  then he would not threaten me; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> for
  truth and reproof are from him; and he would bring forth my judgment to an
  end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For if I shall go first, and
  exist no longer, still what do I know concerning the latter end? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> When he wrought on the left hand, then I observed
  it not: his right hand shall encompass me but I shall not see it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> For he knows already my way; and he
  has tried me as gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I will go
  forth according to his commandments, for I have kept his ways; and I shall
  not turn aside from his commandments, <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  neither shall I transgress; but I have hid his words in my bosom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if too he has thus judged, who is
  he that has contradicted, for he has both willed a thing and done it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore am I troubled at him; and
  when I was reproved, I thought of him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Therefore let me take good heed before him: I
  will consider, and be afraid of him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  But the Lord has softened my heart, and the Almighty has troubled me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For I knew not that darkness would
  come upon me, and thick darkness has covered me before my face.</p>

  <h3 id="job24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But why have the seasons been
  hidden from the Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> while the
  ungodly have passed over the bound, carrying off the flock with the shepherd?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They have led away, the ass of the
  fatherless, and taken the widow’s ox for a pledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They have turned aside the weak from the right
  way: and the meek of the earth have hidden themselves together. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they have departed like asses in the field,
  having gone forth on my account according to their own order: his bread is
  sweet to his little ones. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They have
  reaped a field that was not their own before the time: the poor have laboured
  in the vineyards of the ungodly without pay and without food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They have caused many naked to sleep without
  clothes, and they have taken away the covering of their body. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They are wet with the drops of the mountains: they
  have embraced the rock, because they had no shelter. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They have snatched the fatherless from the breast,
  and have afflicted the outcast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  they have wrongfully caused others to sleep without clothing, and taken away
  the morsel of the hungry. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> They have
  unrighteously laid wait in narrow places, and have not known the righteous
  way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Who have cast forth the poor
  from the city and their own houses, and the soul of the children has groaned
  aloud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Why then has he not visited
  these? forasmuch as they were upon the earth, and took no notice, and they
  knew not the way of righteousness, neither have they walked in their
  appointed paths? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But having known
  their works, he delivered them into darkness: and in the night one will be as
  a thief: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> and the eye of the adulterer
  has watched for the darkness, saying, Eye shall not perceive me, and he puts
  a covering on his face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> In darkness
  he digs through houses: by day they conceal themselves securely: they know
  not the light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For the morning is to
  them all as the shadow of death, for each will be conscious of the terror of
  the shadow of death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He is swift on
  the face of the water: let his portion be cursed on the earth; and let their
  plants be laid bare. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Let them be
  withered upon the earth; for they have plundered the sheaves of the
  fatherless. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Then is his sin brought
  to remembrance, and he vanishes like a vapour of dew: but let what he has
  done be recompensed to him, and let every unrighteous one be crushed like
  rotten wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For he has not treated
  the barren woman well, and has had no pity on a feeble woman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And in wrath he has overthrown the helpless:
  therefore when he has arisen, a man will not feel secure of his own life.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> When he has fallen sick, let him not
  hope to recover: but let him perish by disease. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For his exaltation has hurt many; but he has
  withered as mallows in the heat, or as an ear of corn falling off of itself
  from the stalk. (25) But if not, who is he that says I speak falsely, and
  will make my words of no account?</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Baldad the Sauchite answered

  his—even he that makes all things in the highest? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For let none think that there is a respite for
  robbers: and upon whom will there not come a snare from him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For how shall a mortal be just before the Lord? or
  who that is born of a woman shall purify himself? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If he gives an order to the moon, then it shines
  not; and the stars are not pure before him. <span style=

  <h3 id="job26">26</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Job answered and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> To whom dost thou attach thyself, or
  whom art thou going to assist? is it not he that has much strength, and he
  who has a strong arm? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> To whom hast
  thou given counsel? is it not to him who has all wisdom? whom wilt thou
  follow? is it not one who has the greatest power? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose breath
  is it that has come forth from thee? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Shall giants be born from under the water and the inhabitants thereof?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Hell is naked before him, and
  destruction has no covering. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He
  stretches out the north wind upon nothing, and he upon nothing hangs the
  earth; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> binding water in his clouds,
  and the cloud is not rent under it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He
  keeps back the face of his throne, stretching out his cloud upon it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He has encompassed the face of the
  water by an appointed ordinance, until the end of light and darkness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The pillars of heaven are prostrate
  and astonished at his rebuke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He has
  calmed the sea with his might, and by his wisdom the whale has been
  overthrown. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the barriers of
  heaven fear him, and by a command he has slain the apostate dragon.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Behold, these are parts of his way;
  and we will hearken to him at the least intimation of his word: but the
  strength of his thunder who knows, when he shall employ it?</p>

  <h3 id="job27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Job further continued and said
  in his parable, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> As God lives, who has
  thus judge me; and the Almighty, who has embittered my soul; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> verily, while my breath is yet in me, and the
  breath of God which remains to me is in my nostrils, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> my lips shall not speak evil words, neither shall
  my soul meditate unrighteous thoughts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  Far be it from me that I should justify you till I die; for I will not let go
  my innocence, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but keeping fast to my
  righteousness I will by no means let it go: for I am not conscious to myself
  of having done any thing amiss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Nay
  rather, but let mine enemies be as the overthrow of the ungodly, and they
  that rise up against me, as the destruction of transgressors. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For what is the hope of the ungodly, that he holds
  to it? will he indeed trust in the Lord and be saved? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Will God hear his prayer? or, when distress has
  come upon him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> has he any confidence
  before him? or will God hear him as he calls upon him? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Yet now I will tell you what is in the hand of
  the Lord: I will not lie concerning the things which are with the Almighty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Behold, ye all know that ye are
  adding vanity to vanity. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> This is the
  portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of oppressors
  shall come upon them from the Almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And if their children be many, they shall be for
  slaughter: and if they grow up, they shall beg. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they that survive of him shall utterly
  perish, and no one shall pity their widows. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Even if he should gather silver as earth, and
  prepare gold as clay; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> All these
  things shall the righteous gain, and the truehearted shall possess his
  wealth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And his house is gone like
  moths, and like a spider’s web. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The
  rich man shall lie down, and shall not continue: he has opened his eyes, and
  he is not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Pains have come upon him
  as water, and darkness has carried him away by night. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And a burning wind shall catch him, and he shall
  depart, and it shall utterly drive him out of his place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And God shall cast trouble upon him, and not
  spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He shall cause men to clap their hands against
  them, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>

  <h3 id="job28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> For there is a place for the
  silver, whence it comes, and a place for the gold, whence it is refined.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For iron comes out of the earth, and
  brass is hewn out like stone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He has
  set a bound to darkness, and he searches out every limit: a stone is
  darkness, and the shadow of death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  There is a cutting off the torrent by reason of dust: so they that forget the
  right way are weakened; they are removed from among men. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> As for the earth, out of it shall come bread:
  under it has been turned up as it were fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Her stones are the place of the sapphire: and her
  dust supplies man with gold. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> There is
  a path, the fowl has not known it, neither has the eye of the vulture seen
  it: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> neither have the sons of the proud
  trodden it, a lion has not passed upon it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He has stretched forth his hand on the sharp rock,
  and turned up mountains by the roots: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  and he has interrupted the whirlpools of rivers, and mine eye has seen every
  precious thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he has laid bare
  the depths of rivers, and has brought his power to light. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But whence has wisdom been discovered? and what
  is the place of knowledge? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> A mortal
  has not known its way, neither indeed has it been discovered among men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The depth said, It is not in me: and
  the sea said, It is not with me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> One
  shall not give fine gold instead of it, neither shall silver be weighed in
  exchange for it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Neither shall it be
  compared with gold of Sophir, with the precious onyx and sapphire.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Gold and crystal shall not be
  equalled to it, neither shall vessels of gold be its exchange. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Coral and fine pearl shall not be mentioned: but
  do thou esteem wisdom above the most precious things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equalled to
  it; it shall not be compared with pure gold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Whence then is wisdom found? and of what kind is
  the place of understanding? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It has
  escaped the notice of every man, and has been hidden from the birds of the
  sky. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Destruction and Death said, We
  have heard the report of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> God has
  well ordered the way of it, and he knows the place of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For he surveys the whole earth under heaven,
  knowing the things in the earth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> all
  that he has made; the weight of the winds, the measures of the water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> When he made them, thus he saw and
  numbered them, and made a way for the pealing of the thunder. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then he saw it, and declared it: he prepared it
  and traced it out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he said to
  man, Behold, godliness is wisdom: and to abstain from evil is
  understanding.</p>

  <h3 id="job29">29</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Job continued and said in his

  past, wherein God preserved me! <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> As
  when his lamp shone over my head; when by his light I walked through
  darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> As when I steadfastly
  pursued my ways, when God took care of my house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> When I was very fruitful, and my children were
  about me; <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> when my ways were moistened
  with butter, and the mountains flowed for me with milk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> When I went forth early in the city, and the seat
  was placed for me in the streets. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The
  young men saw me, and hid themselves: and all the old men stood up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the great men ceased speaking, and
  laid their finger on their mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And
  they that heard me blessed me, and their tongue clave to their throat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the ear heard, and blessed me;
  and the eye saw me, and turned aside. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  For I saved the poor out of the hand of the oppressor, and helped the
  fatherless who had no helper. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Let the
  blessing of the perishing one come upon me; yea, the mouth of the widow has
  blessed me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Also I put on
  righteousness, and clothed myself with judgment like a mantle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I was the eye of the blind, and the foot of the
  lame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I was the father of the
  helpless; and I searched out the cause which I knew not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And I broke the jaw-teeth of the unrighteous; I
  plucked the spoil out of the midst of their teeth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And I said, My age shall continue as the stem of
  a palm-tree; I shall live a long while. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> My root was spread out by the water, and the dew
  would lodge on my crop. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> My glory was
  fresh in me, and by bow prospered in his hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Men heard me, and gave heed, and they were silent
  at my counsel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> At my word they spoke
  not again, and they were very gland whenever I spoke to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> As the thirsty earth expecting the rain, so they
  waited for my speech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Were I to laugh
  on them, they would not believe it; and the light of my face has not failed.
  (25) I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the midst

  They are sons of fools and vile men, whose name and glory are quenched from
  off the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But now I am their
  music, and they have me for a by-word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they stood aloof and abhorred me, and spared
  not to spit in my face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he has
  opened his quiver and afflicted me: they also have cast off the restraint of
  my presence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They have risen up
  against me on the right hand of their offspring; they have stretched out
  their foot, and directed against me the ways of their destruction.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> My paths are ruined; for they have
  stripped off my raiment: he has shot at me with his weapons. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he has pleaded against me as he will: I am
  overwhelmed with pains. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> My pains
  return upon me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my safety as a cloud.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Even now my life shall be poured
  forth upon me; and days of anguish seize me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And by night my bones are confounded; and my
  sinews are relaxed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> With great force
  my disease has taken hold of my garment: it has compassed me as the collar of
  my coat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And thou hast counted me as
  clay; my portion in dust and ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  And I have cried to thee, but thou hearest me not: but they stood still, and
  observed me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They attacked me also
  without mercy: thou hast scourged me with a strong hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And thou hast put me to grief, and hast cast me
  away from safety. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For I know that
  death will destroy me: for the earth is the house appointed for every mortal.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Oh then that I might lay hands upon
  myself, or at least ask another, and he should do this for me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Yet I wept over every helpless man; I groaned
  when I saw a man in distress. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But I,
  when I waited for good things, behold, days of evils came the more upon me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> My belly boiled, and would not cease:
  the days of poverty prevented me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> I
  went mourning without restraint: and I have stood and cried out in the
  assembly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> I am become a brother of
  monsters, and a companion of ostriches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And my skin has been greatly blackened, and my
  bones are burned with heat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> My harp
  also has been turned into mourning, and my song into my weeping.</p>

  <h3 id="job31">31</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I made a covenant with mine eyes,
  and I will not think upon a virgin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Now what portion has God given from above? and is there an inheritance given
  of the Mighty One from the highest? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Alas! destruction to the unrighteous, and rejection to them that do iniquity.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Will he not see my way, and number all
  my steps? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But if I had gone with
  scorners, and if too my foot has hasted to deceit: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> (for I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord
  knows my innocence:) <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> if my foot has
  turned aside out of the way, or if mine heart has followed mine eye, and if
  too I have touched gifts with my hands; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> then let me sow, and let others eat; and let me be
  uprooted on the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If my heart has
  gone forth after another man’s wife, and if I laid wait at her doors;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> then let my wife also please another,
  and let my children be brought low. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  For the rage of anger is not to be controlled, in the case of defiling
  another man’s wife. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For it is a fire
  burning on every side, and whomsoever it attacks, it utterly destroys.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And if too I despised the judgment of
  my servant or my handmaid, when they pleaded with me; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> what then shall I do if the Lord should try me?
  and if also he should at all visit me, can I make an answer? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Were not they too formed as I also was formed in
  the womb? yea, we were formed in the same womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But the helpless missed not whatever need they
  had, and I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And if too I ate my morsel alone, and did not
  impart of it to the orphan; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> (for I
  nourished them as a father from my youth and guided them from my mother’s
  womb.) <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And if too I overlooked the
  naked as he was perishing, and did not clothe him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and if the poor did not bless me, and their
  shoulders were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> if I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting
  that my strength was far superior to his: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> let them my shoulder start from the blade-bone,
  and my arm be crushed off from the elbow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For the fear of the Lord constrained me, and I
  cannot bear up by reason of his burden. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> If I made gold my treasure, and if too I trusted
  the precious stone; <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and if too I
  rejoiced when my wealth was abundant, and if too I laid my hand on
  innumerable treasures: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> (do we not see
  the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not power to
  continue:) <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and if my heart was
  secretly deceived, and if I have laid my hand upon my mouth and kissed it:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> let this also then be reckoned to me
  as the greatest iniquity: for I should have lied against the Lord Most High.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And if too I was glad at the fall of
  mine enemies, and mine heart said, Aha! <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> let then mine ear hear my curse, and let me be a
  byword among my people in my affliction. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that
  we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> for the stranger did not lodge without, and my
  door was opened to every one that came:) <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my
  sin; <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> (for I did not stand in awe of a
  great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I
  permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> (Oh that I had a hearer,)and if I had not feared
  the hand of the Lord; and as to the written charge which I had against any
  one, <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> I would place it as a chaplet on
  my shoulders, and read it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And if I
  did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> If at any time the land groaned
  against me, and if its furrows mourned together; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> and if I ate its strength alone without price,
  and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking aught from
  him: <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> then let the nettle come up to
  me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley. And Job ceased
  speaking.</p>

  <h3 id="job32">32</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And his three friends also ceased
  any longer to answer Job: for Job was righteous before them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Then Elius the son of Barachiel, the Buzite, of
  the kindred of Ram, of the country of Ausis, was angered: and he was very
  angry with Job, because he justified himself before the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And he was also very angry with his three friends,
  because they were not able to return answers to Job, yet set him down for an
  ungodly man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Elius had forborne to
  give an answer to Job, because they were older than he. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Elius saw that there was no answer in the
  mouth of the three men; and he was angered in his wrath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Elius the Buzite the son of Barachiel answered
  and said, I am younger in age, and ye are elder, wherefore I kept silence,
  fearing to declare to you my own knowledge. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I said, It is not time that speaks, though in
  many years men know wisdom: <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> but there
  is a spirit in mortals; and the inspiration of the Almighty is that which
  teaches. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The long-lived are not wise
  as such; neither do the aged know judgment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Wherefore I said, Hear me, and I will tell you
  what I know. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Hearken to my words; for
  I will speak in your hearing, until ye shall have tried the matter with
  words: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and I shall understand as far
  as you; and, behold, there was no one of you that answered Job his words in
  argument, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> lest ye should say, We have
  found that we have added wisdom to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And ye have commissioned a man to speak such
  words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They were afraid, they
  answered no longer; they gave up their speaking. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I waited, (for I had not spoken,) because they
  stood still, they answered not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And
  Elius continued, and said, I will again speak, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> for I am full of words, for the spirit of my
  belly destroys me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And my belly is as
  a skin of sweet wine, bound up and ready to burst; or as a brazier’s
  labouring bellows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> I will speak, that
  I may open my lips and relieve myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For truly I will not be awed because of man, nor
  indeed will I be confounded before a mortal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For I know not how to respect persons: and if
  otherwise, even the moths would eat me.</p>

  <h3 id="job33">33</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Howbeit hear, Job, my words, and
  hearken to my speech. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> For behold, I
  have opened my mouth, and my tongue has spoken. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> My heart shall be found pure by my words; and the
  understanding of my lips shall meditate purity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The Divine Spirit is that which formed me, and the
  breath of the Almighty that which teaches me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If thou canst, give me an answer: wait therefore;
  stand against me, and I will stand against thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Thou art formed out of the clay as also I: we have
  been formed out of the same substance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  My fear shall not terrify thee, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But thou hast said in mine ears, (I
  have heard the voice of thy words;)because thou sayest, I am pure, not having
  sinned; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I am blameless, for I have not
  transgressed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Yet he has discovered a
  charge against me, and he has reckoned me as an adversary. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he has put my foot in the stocks, and has
  watched all my ways. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For how sayest
  thou, I am righteous, yet he has not hearkened to me? for he that is above
  mortals is eternal. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But thou sayest,
  Why has he not heard every word of my cause? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For when the Lord speaks once, or a second time,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> sending a dream, or in the meditation
  of the night; (as when a dreadful alarm happens to fall upon men, in
  slumberings on the bed:) <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> then opens
  he the understanding of men: he scares them with such fearful visions:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> to turn a man from unrighteousness,
  and he delivers his body from a fall. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  He spares also his soul from death, and suffers him not to fall in war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And again, he chastens him with
  sickness on his bed, and the multitude of his bones is benumbed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he shall not be able to take any food, though
  his soul shall desire meat; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> until his
  flesh shall be consumed, and he shall shew his bones bare. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> His soul also draws nigh to death, and his life
  is in Hades. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Though there should be a
  thousand messengers of death, not one of them shall wound him: if he should
  purpose in his heart to turn to the Lord, and declare to man his fault, and
  shew his folly; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> he will support him,
  that he should not perish, and will restore his body as fresh plaster upon a
  wall; and he will fill his bones with morrow. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he will make his flesh tender as that of a
  babe, and he will restore him among men in his full strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he shall pray to the Lord, and his prayer
  shall be accepted of him; he shall enter with a cheerful countenance, with a
  full expression of praise: for he will render to men their due. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Even then a man shall blame himself, saying, What
  kind of things have I done? and he has not punished me according to the full
  amount of my sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Deliver my soul,
  that it may not go to destruction, and my life shall see the light.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Behold, all these things, the Mighty
  One works in a threefold manner with a man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And he has delivered my soul from death, that my
  life may praise him in the light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Hearken, Job, and hear me: be silent, and I will speak. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> If thou hast words, answer me: speak, for I
  desire thee to be justified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> If not,
  do thou hear me: be silent, and I will teach thee.</p>

  <h3 id="job34">34</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Elius continued, and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear me, ye wise men; hearken, ye that
  have knowledge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For the ear tries
  words, and the mouth tastes meat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Let
  us choose judgment to ourselves: let us know amount ourselves what is right.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For Job has said, I am righteous: the
  Lord has removed my judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he
  has erred in my judgment: my wound is severe without unrighteousness of mine.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> What man is as Job, drinking scorning
  like water? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> saying, I have not sinned,
  nor committed ungodliness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity, to go
  with the ungodly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For thou shouldest
  not say, There shall be no visitation of a man, whereas there is a visitation
  on him from the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Wherefore hear
  me, ye that are wise in heart: far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and
  to pervert righteousness before the almighty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Yea, he renders to a man accordingly as each of
  them does, and in a man’s path he will find him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And thinkest thou that the Lord will do wrong, or
  will the Almighty who made the earth wrest judgment? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And who is he that made the whole world under
  heaven, and all things therein? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> For
  if he would confine, and restrain his spirit with himself; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> all flesh would die together, and every mortal
  would return to the earth, whence also he was formed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Take heed lest he rebuke thee: hear this, hearken
  to the voice of words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Behold then
  the one that hates iniquities, and that destroys the wicked, who is for ever
  just. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He is ungodly that says to a
  king, Thou art a transgressor, that says to princes, O most ungodly one.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Such a one as would not reverence the
  face of an honourable man, neither knows how to give honour to the great, so
  as that their persons should be respected. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But it shall turn out vanity to them, to cry and
  beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, the poor being turned aside from
  their right. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For he surveys the works
  of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Neither shall there be a place for the workers of
  iniquity to hide themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For he
  will not lay upon a man more than right. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For the Lord looks down upon all men, who
  comprehends unsearchable things, glorious also and excellent things without
  number. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Who discovers their works,
  and will bring night about upon them, and they shall be brought low.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And he quite destroys the ungodly,
  for they are seen before him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Because
  they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> so as to bring before him the cry of
  the needy; for he will hear the cry of the poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he will give quiet, and who will condemn? and
  he will hide his face, and who shall see him? whether it be done against a
  nation, or against a man also: <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  causing a hypocrite to be king, because of the waywardness of the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For there is one that says to the
  Mighty One, I have received blessings; I will not take a pledge: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> I will see apart from myself: do thou shew me if
  I have done unrighteousness; I will not do so any more. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Will he take vengeance for it on thee, whereas
  thou wilt put it far from thee? for thou shalt choose, and not I; and what
  thou knowest, speak thou. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Because the
  wise in heart shall say this, and a wise man listens to my word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But Job has not spoken with understanding, his
  words are not uttered with knowledge. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  Howbeit do thou learn, Job: no longer make answer as the foolish:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> that we add not to our sins: for
  iniquity will be reckoned against us, if we speak many words before the
  Lord.</p>

  <h3 id="job35">35</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Elius resumed and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> What is this that thou thinkest to be
  according to right? who art thou that thou hast said, I am righteous before
  the Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will answer thee, and thy
  three friends. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Look up to the sky and
  see; and consider the clouds, how high they are above thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> If thou hast sinned, what wilt thou do?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and if too thou hast transgressed
  much, what canst thou perform? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And
  suppose thou art righteous, what wilt thou give him? or what shall he receive
  of thy hand? <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Thy ungodliness may
  affect a man who is like to thee; or thy righteousness a son of man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They that are oppressed of a multitude
  will be ready to cry out; they will call for help because of the arm of many.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But none said, Where is God that made
  me, who appoints the night-watches; <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  who makes me to differ from the four-footed beasts of the earth, and from the
  birds of the sky? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> There they shall
  cry, and none shall hearken, even because of the insolence of wicked men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For the Lord desires not to look on
  error, for he is the Almighty One. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> He
  beholds them that perform lawless deeds, and he will save me: and do thou
  plead before him, if thou canst praise him, as it is possible even now.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For he is not now regarding his
  wrath, nor has he noticed severely any trespass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Yet Job vainly opens his mouth, in ignorance he
  multiplies words.</p>

  <h3 id="job36">36</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Elius further continued, and
  said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Wait for me yet a little while,
  that I may teach thee: for there is yet speech in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Having fetched my knowledge from afar, and
  according to my works, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I will speak
  just things truly, and thou shalt not unjustly receive unjust words.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But know that the Lord will not cast
  off an innocent man: being mighty in strength of wisdom, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> he will not by any means save alive the ungodly:
  and he will grant the judgment of the poor. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He will not turn away his eyes from the righteous,
  but they shall be with kings on the throne: and he will establish them in
  triumph, and they shall be exalted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  But they that are bound in fetters shall be holden in cords of poverty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he shall recount to them their
  works, and their transgressions, for such will act with violence.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But he will hearken to the righteous:
  and he has said that they shall turn from unrighteousness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If they should hear and serve him, they shall
  spend their days in prosperity, and their years in honour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But he preserves not the ungodly; because they
  are not willing to know the Lord, and because when reproved they were
  disobedient. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the hypocrites in
  heart will array wrath against themselves; they will not cry, because he has
  bound them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Therefore let their soul
  die in youth, and their life be wounded by messengers of death. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Because they afflicted the weak and helpless: and
  he will vindicate the judgment of the meek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he has also enticed thee out of the mouth of
  the enemy: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> there is a deep gulf and a
  rushing stream beneath it, and thy table came down full of fatness. Judgment
  shall not fail from the righteous; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of
  the bribes which they received for iniquities. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Let not thy mind willingly turn thee aside from
  the petition of the feeble that are in distress. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And draw not forth all the mighty men by night,
  so that the people should go up instead of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But take heed lest thou do that which is wrong:
  for of this thou has made choice because of poverty. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his
  strength: for who is powerful as he is? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And who is he that examines his works? or who can
  say, he has wrought injustice? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Remember that his works are great beyond those which men have attempted.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Every man has seen in himself, how
  many mortals are wounded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Behold, the
  Mighty One is great, and we shall not know him: the number of his years is
  even infinite. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the drops of rain
  are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The ancient heavens shall flow, and
  the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28a)</span> he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the
  order of rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28b)</span> Yet by all these
  things thy understanding is not astonished, neither is thy mind disturbed in
  thy body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And though one should
  understand the outspreadings of the clouds, or the measure of his tabernacle;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> behold he will stretch his bow
  against him, and he covers the bottom of the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> For by them he will judge the nations: he will
  give food to him that has strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  He has hidden the light in his hands, and given charge concerning it to the
  interposing cloud. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The Lord will
  declare concerning this to his friend: but there is a portion also for
  unrighteousness.</p>

  <h3 id="job37">37</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> At this also my heart is troubled,
  and moved out of its place. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Hear thou
  a report by the anger of the Lord’s wrath, and a discourse shall come out of
  his mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> His dominion is under the
  whole heaven, and his light is at the extremities of the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> After him shall be a cry with a loud voice; he
  shall thunder with the voice of his excellency, yet he shall not cause men to
  pass away, for one shall hear his voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The Mighty One shall thunder wonderfully with his
  voice: for he has done great things which we knew not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> commanding the snow, Be thou upon the earth, and
  the stormy rain, and the storm of the showers of his might. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He seals up the hand of every man, that every man
  may know his own weakness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the
  wild beasts come in under the covert, and rest in their lair. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Troubles come on out of the secret chambers, and
  cold from the mountain-tops. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And from
  the breath of the Mighty One he will send frost; and he guides the water in
  whatever way he pleases. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And if a
  cloud obscures what is precious to him, his light will disperse the cloud.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he will carry round the
  encircling clouds by his governance, to perform their works: whatsoever he
  shall command them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> this has been
  appointed by him on the earth, whether for correction, or for his land, or if
  he shall find him an object for mercy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and be
  admonished of the power of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  We know that god has disposed his works, having made light out of darkness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he knows the divisions of the
  clouds, and the signal overthrows of the ungodly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But thy robe is warm, and there is quiet upon the
  land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Wilt thou establish with him
  foundations for the ancient heavens? they are strong as a molten mirror.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Wherefore teach me, what shall we say
  to him? and let us cease from saying much. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Have I a book or a scribe my me, that I may stand
  and put man to silence? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But the light
  is not visible to all: it shines afar off in the heavens, as that which is
  from him in the clouds. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> From the
  north come the clouds shining like gold: in these great are the glory and
  honour of the Almighty; <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and we do not
  find another his equal in strength: as for him that judges justly, dost thou
  not think that he listens? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Wherefore
  men shall fear him; and the wise also in heart shall fear him.</p>

  <h3 id="job38">38</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after Elius had ceased from
  speaking, the Lord spoke to Job through the whirlwind and clouds, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Who is this that hides counsel from
  me, and confines words in his heart, and thinks to conceal them from me?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Gird thy loins like a man; and I will
  ask thee, and do thou answer me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Where
  wast thou when I founded the earth? tell me now, if thou hast knowledge,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> who set the measures of it, if thou
  knowest? or who stretched a line upon it? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> On what are its rings fastened? and who is he that
  laid the corner-stone upon it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> When
  the stars were made, all my angels praised me with a loud voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I shut up the sea with gates, when it rushed
  out, coming forth out its mother’s womb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And I made a cloud its clothing, and swathed it in
  mist. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And I set bounds to it,
  surrounding it with bars and gates. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  And I said to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, but thou shalt not go beyond, but
  thy waves shall be confined within thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Or did I order the morning light in thy time; and
  did the morning star then first see his appointed place; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> to lay hold of the extremities of the earth, to
  cast out the ungodly out of it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Or
  didst thou take clay of the ground, and form a living creature, and set it
  with the power of speech upon the earth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And hast thou removed light from the ungodly, and
  crushed the arm of the proud? <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Or hast
  thou gone to the source of the sea, and walked in the tracks of the deep?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And do the gates of death open to
  thee for fear; and did the porters of hell quake when they saw thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And hast thou been instructed in the
  breadth of the whole earth under heaven? tell me now, what is the extent of
  it? <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And in what kind of a land does
  the light dwell? and of what kind is the place of darkness? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> If thou couldest bring me to their utmost
  boundaries, and if also thou knowest their paths; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I know then that thou wert born at that time, and
  the number of thy years is great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But
  hast thou gone to the treasures of snow? and hast thou seen the treasures of
  hail? <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And is there a store of them,
  for thee against the time of thine enemies, for the day of wars and battle?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And whence proceeds the frost? or
  whence is the south wind dispersed over the whole world under heaven?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And who prepared a course for the
  violent rain, and a way for the thunders; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> to rain upon the land where there is no man, the
  wilderness, where there is not a man in it; so as to feed the untrodden and
  uninhabited land, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and cause it to
  send forth a crop of green herbs? <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Who
  is the rain’s father? and who has generated the drops of dew? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And out of whose womb comes the ice? and who has
  produced the frost in the sky, <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> which
  descends like flowing water? who has terrified the face of the ungodly?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And dost thou understand the band of
  Pleias, and hast thou opened the barrier of Orion? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Or wilt thou reveal Mazuroth in his season, and
  the evening star with his rays? Wilt thou guide them? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And knowest thou the changes of heaven, or the
  events which take place together under heaven? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And wilt thou call a cloud with thy voice, and
  will it obey thee with a violent shower of much rain? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And wilt thou send lightnings, and they shall go?
  and shall they say to thee, What is thy pleasure? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And who has given to women skill in weaving, or
  knowledge of embroidery? <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And who is
  he that numbers the clouds in wisdom, and has bowed the heaven down to the
  earth? <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> For it is spread out as dusty
  earth, and I have cemented it as one hewn stone to another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And wilt thou hunt a prey for the lions? and
  satisfy the desires of the serpents? <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span>
  For they fear in their lairs, and lying in wait couch in the woods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And who has prepared food for the
  raven? for its young ones wander and cry to the Lord, in search of food.</p>

  <h3 id="job39">39</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Say if thou knowest the time of the
  bringing forth of the wild goats of the rock, and if thou hast marked the
  calving of the hinds: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and if thou has
  hast numbered the full months of their being with young, and if thou hast
  relieved their pangs: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and hast reared
  their young without fear; and wilt thou loosen their pangs? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Their young will break forth; they will be
  multiplied with offspring: their young will go forth, and will not return to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And who is he that sent forth
  the wild ass free? and who loosed his bands? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> whereas I made his habitation the wilderness, and
  the salt land his coverts. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He laughs
  to scorn the multitude of the city, and hears not the chiding of the
  tax-gatherer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He will survey the
  mountains as his pasture, and he seeks after every green thing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or
  to lie down at thy manger? <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And wilt
  thou bind his yoke with thongs, or will he plough furrows for thee in the
  plain? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And dost thou trust him,
  because his strength is great? and wilt thou commit thy works to him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And wilt thou believe that he will
  return to thee thy seed, and bring it in to thy threshing-floor? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The peacock has a beautiful wing: if the stork
  and the ostrich conceive, it is worthy of notice, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> for the ostrich will leave her eggs in the
  ground, and warm them on the dust, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  and has forgotten that the foot will scatter them, and the wild beasts of the
  field trample them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> She has hardened
  herself against her young ones, as though she bereaved not herself: she
  labours in vain without fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For God
  has withholden wisdom from her, and not given her a portion in understanding.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> In her season she will lift herself
  on high; she will scorn the horse and his rider. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Hast thou invested the horse with strength, and
  clothed his neck with terror? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  hast thou clad him in perfect armour, and made his breast glorious with
  courage? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He paws exulting in the
  plain, and goes forth in strength into the plain. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He laughs to scorn a king as he meets him, and
  will by no means turn back from the sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The bow and sword resound against him; and his
  rage will swallow up the ground: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and
  he will not believe until the trumpet sounds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And when the trumpet sounds, he says, Aha! and
  afar off he smells the war with prancing and neighing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And does the hawk remain steady by thy wisdom,
  having spread out her wings unmoved, looking toward the region of the south?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And does the eagle rise at thy
  command, and the vulture remain sitting over his nest, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> on a crag of a rock, and in a secret place?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Thence he seeks food, his eyes
  observe from far. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And his young ones
  roll themselves in blood, and wherever the carcasses may be, immediately they
  are found. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And the Lord God answered
  Job, and said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Will any one pervert
  judgment with the Mighty One? and he that reproves God, let him return it for
  answer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And Job answered and said to
  the Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Why do I yet plead? being
  rebuked even while reproving the Lord: hearing such things, whereas I am
  nothing: and what shall I answer to these arguments? I will lay my hand upon
  my mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I have spoken once; but I
  will not do so a second time.</p>

  <h3 id="job40">40</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the Lord yet again answered and
  spoke to Job out of the cloud, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  Nay, gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will ask thee, and do thou
  answer me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Do not set aside my
  judgment: and dost thou think that I have dealt with thee in any other way,
  than that thou mightest appear to be righteous? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Hast thou an arm like the Lord’s? or dost thou
  thunder with a voice like his? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Assume
  now a lofty bearing and power; and clothe thyself with glory and honour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And send forth messengers with wrath;
  and lay low every haughty one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Bring
  down also the proud man; and consume at once the ungodly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And hide them together in the earth; and fill
  their faces with shame. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Then will I
  confess that thy right hand can save thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But now look at the wild beasts with thee; they
  eat grass like oxen. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Behold now, his
  strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> He sets up his tail like a cypress;
  and his nerves are wrapped together. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  His sides are sides of brass; and his backbone is as cast iron. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> This is the chief of the creation of the Lord;
  made to be played with by his angels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And when he has gone up to a steep mountain, he causes joy to the quadrupeds
  in the deep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> He lies under trees of
  every kind, by the papyrus, and reed, and bulrush. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the great trees make a shadow over him with
  their branches, and so do the bushes of the field. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> If there should be a flood, he will not perceive
  it; he trust that Jordan will rush up into his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Yet one shall take him in his sight; one shall
  catch him with a cord, and pierce his nose. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But wilt thou catch the serpent with a hook, and
  put a halter about his nose? <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Or wilt
  thou fasten a ring in his nostril, and bore his lip with a clasp?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Will he address thee with a petition?
  softly, with the voice of a suppliant? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And will he make a covenant with thee? and wilt
  thou take him for a perpetual servant? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or
  bind him as a sparrow for a child? <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And do the nations feed upon him, and the nations of the Phoenicians share
  him? <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And all the ships come together
  would not be able to bear the mere skin of his tail; neither shall they carry
  his head in fishing-vessels. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But thou
  shalt lay thy hand upon him once, remembering the war that is waged by his
  mouth; and let it not be done any more.</p>

  <h3 id="job41">41</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Hast thou not seen him? and hast
  thou not wondered at the things said of him? Dost thou not fear because
  preparation has been made by me? for who is there that resists me?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Or who will resist me, and abide,
  since the whole world under heaven is mine? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I will not be silent because of him: though
  because of his power one shall pity his antagonist. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Who will open the face of his garment? and who can
  enter within the fold of his breastplate? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Who will open the doors of his face? terror is
  round about his teeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> His inwards are
  as brazen plates, and the texture of his skin as a smyrite stone.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> One part cleaves fast to another, and
  the air cannot come between them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> They
  will remain united each to the other: they are closely joined, and cannot be
  separated. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> At his sneezing a light
  shines, and his eyes are as the appearance of the morning star. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Out of his mouth proceed as it were burning
  lamps, and as it were hearths of fire are cast abroad. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Out of his nostrils proceeds smoke of a furnace
  burning with fire of coals. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> His
  breath is as live coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And power is lodged in his neck, before him
  destruction runs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The flesh also of
  his body is joined together: if one pours violence upon him, he shall not be
  moved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> His heart is firm as a stone,
  and it stands like an unyielding anvil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And when he turns, he is a terror to the
  four-footed wild beasts which leap upon the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If spears should come against him, men will
  effect nothing, either with the spear or the breast-plate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> For he considers iron as chaff, and brass as
  rotten wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The bow of brass shall
  not would him, he deems a slinger as grass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Mauls are counted as stubble; and he laughs to
  scorn the waving of the firebrand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  His lair is formed of sharp points; and all the gold of the sea under him is
  an immense quantity of clay. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> He makes
  the deep boil like a brazen caldron; and he regards the sea as a pot of
  ointment, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> and the lowest part of the
  deep as a captive: he reckons the deep as his range. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> There is nothing upon the earth like to him,
  formed to be sported with by my angels. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He beholds every high thing: and he is king of
  all that are in the waters.</p>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Job answered and said to the
  Lord, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I know that thou canst do all
  things, and nothing is impossible with thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> For who is he that hides counsel from thee? or who
  keeps back his words, and thinks to hide them from thee? and who will tell me
  what I knew not, great and wonderful things which I understood not?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But hear me, O Lord, that I also may
  speak: and I will ask thee, and do thou teach me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I have heard the report of thee by the ear before;
  but now mine eye has seen thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  Wherefore I have counted myself vile, and have fainted: and I esteem myself
  dust and ashes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it came to pass
  after the Lord had spoken all these words to Job, that the Lord said to
  Eliphaz the Thaemanite, Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends: for ye have
  not said anything true before me, as my servant Job has. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams, and
  go to my servant Job, and he shall offer a burnt-offering for you. And my
  servant Job shall pray for you, for I will only accept him: for but his sake,
  I would have destroyed you, for ye have not spoken the truth against my
  servant Job. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> So Eliphaz the
  Thaemanite, and Baldad the Sauchite, and Sophar the Minaean, went and did as
  the Lord commanded them: and he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord prospered Job: and when
  he prayed also for his friends, he forgave them their sin: and the Lord gave
  Job twice as much, even the double of what he had before. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And all his brethren and his sisters heard all
  that had happened to him, and they came to him, and so did all that had known
  him from the first: and they ate and drank with him, and comforted him, and
  wondered at all that the Lord had brought upon him: and each one gave him a
  lamb, and four drachms’ weight of gold, even of unstamped gold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job, more
  than the beginning: and his cattle were fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand
  camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, a thousand she-asses of the pastures.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And there were born to him seven sons
  and three daughters. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he called
  the first Day, and the second Casia, and the third Amalthaea’s horn.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And there were not found in
  comparison with the daughters of Job, fairer women than they in all the
  world: and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Job lived after his affliction a
  hundred and seventy years: and all the years he lived were two hundred and
  forty: and Job saw his sons and his sons’ sons, the fourth generation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Job died, an old man and full of
  days: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17a)</span> and it is written that he will
  rise again with those whom the Lord raises up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17b)</span> This man is described in the Syriac book as
  living in the land of Ausis, on the borders of Idumea and Arabia: and his
  name before was Jobab; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17c)</span> and having
  taken an Arabian wife, he begot a son whose name was Ennon. And he himself
  was the son of his father Zare, one of the sons of Esau, and of his mother
  Bosorrha, so that he was the fifth from Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17d)</span> And these were the kings who reigned in Edom,
  which country he also ruled over: first, Balac, the son of Beor, and the name
  of his city was Dennaba: but after Balac, Jobab, who is called Job, and after
  him Asom, who was governor out of the country of Thaeman: and after him Adad,
  the son of Barad, who destroyed Madiam in the plain of Moab; and the name of
  his city was Gethaim. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17e)</span> And his
  friends who came to him were Eliphaz, of the children of Esau, king of the
  Thaemanites, Baldad sovereign the Sauchaeans, Sophar king of the
  Minaeans.</p>
