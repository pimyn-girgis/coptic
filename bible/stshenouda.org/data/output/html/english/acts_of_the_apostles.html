  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> The first treatise indeed I made
  concerning all things, O Theophylle, amongst those which Jesus began to do
  [them] and to teach, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> until the day (in
  which), having charged the apostles through the holy spirit, those whom he
  chose, he was taken away to (the) heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> These to whom he manifested himself alive after
  having suffered, in many signs, through forty days manifesting himself to
  them, and speaking to them concerning the kingdom of God: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and eating with them, he ordered them not to
  depart from Jerusalem, but to stay for the promise of the Father, which ye
  heard from me: <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> because Iōannēs indeed
  baptised in [a] water, but ye (pron.) will be baptised in [a] holy spirit:
  after not many days these (things) happened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> They indeed then having assembled were asking him,
  saying: Lord, in this time wilt thou restore the kingdom to Israel?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> He said to them: 'It is not yours to
  know times or seasons, these which the Father put under his authority.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But ye shall receive [a] power, if the
  holy spirit should come upon you: and ye will be to me witness in Jerusalem,
  and all [the] Ioudea and (the) Samaria, and unto the (lit. his) end of (the)
  earth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having said these things,
  as they gaze, he was lifted up; and a cloud received him from their eyes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But they were [as] staring one at
  another (lit. one) of them, as he goeth (lit. he walking) up to (the) heaven.
  Behold, two men stood with them in white raiment; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and they said, [The] men, [the] Galileans, why
  stand ye gazing up to (the) heaven? This is Jesus who has been taken away up
  from you: this also is as he is coming, as ye saw him going (lit. walking) up
  to (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then they returned
  to Jerusalem from the mountain which is called 'That of the olives,' which is
  near to Jerusalem a sabbath journey. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Then, having gone in, they went up to a room (lit. place) aloft, where was
  abiding Petros with Iōannēs, Iakōbos and Andreas, Philippos and Thōmas,
  Bartholomeos and Matthewtheos, Iakōbos, he of Alpheos, and Simōn the zealot,
  and Ioudas, he of Iakōbos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But all
  these (were) continuing together for the prayer, with (next) women, and Maria
  (the) mother of Jesus, and his brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And in these days Petros rose in. (the) midst of
  the brethren, but there were many assembled together who were to be numbered
  (lit. make) a hundred (and) twenty names: he said, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> [The] men, [the] brethren, it is necessary that
  the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the holy spirit said before from the
  mouth of David concerning Ioudas who guided them who overpowered Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because he was being numbered amongst
  us, and the lot came to him of the heritage of this ministry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> This (man) indeed then bought a field from (the)
  reward of (the) iniquity; and he fell upon his face, he burst in the (lit.
  his) midst, and all that (plur.) which was inside him was poured out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he was manifest to all who dwelt
  in Jerusalem; so that they call (the) name of that field in their language
  'Acheldamag,' which (is) the field of the blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For it is written in (the) book of the Psalms:
  'Let his habitation be desolate, and let there not be him who dwelleth in it.
  His bishopric let another take.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> It
  is necessary then, among the men who came in among us, in all the time which
  our Lord Jesus came in and came out over us, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> having begun from the baptism of Iōannēs until
  the day (in) which he was taken away up from us, that one of these should
  witness with us of his resurrection. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And they set up two, Joseph who is called 'Barsabbas,' who was named
  Ioustos,' and Matthewhias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And having
  prayed, they said: 'Lord, thou (art) he who knoweth (the) heart of all,
  manifest him whom thou chosest from these two one, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> to take (the) place of this ministry and this
  apostleship which Ioudas transgressed, having gone to his place which is
  his.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they gave lot for them; the
  lot came upon Matthewhias; he was counted with the eleven apostles.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the day of the Pentēcostē
  having been fulfilled, they were all assembling in a place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Suddenly there came a sound from (the) heaven as a
  wind rushing, and it filled all (the) house in which they were sitting.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And there appeared to them as tongues
  of fire, divided; and they sat upon each of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they all were filled with [a] holy spirit, and
  they began to speak other tongues, according as the spirit gave to them to
  utter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But there were some dwelling in
  Jerusalem, men, Jews, devout, from all nations which are under (the) heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But this sound having come, the
  multitudes were assembled, and they were confounded, because each was hearing
  them speaking in his (lit. their) language. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But they were all being amazed, wondering, saying:
  'Are not all these who speak Galileans? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> How hear we (pron.) each of us in our language in
  which we were begotten? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The Parthians
  and the Medes and the Elamites, and they who dwell in [the] Mesopotamia,
  [the] Ioudea and [the] Kappodokia, Pontos and [the] Asia, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> [the] Phrikia and [the] Pamphilia, Chēmi and the
  parts of [the] Lybē, that which is near the parts of [the] Kyrinnē, and the
  Romans who are among us, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> the Jews and
  the strangers, the Cretans and the Arabians, we hear them speaking in tongues
  the great things of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But they
  were all amazed, staring one at another, saying: What is this which
  happened?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But others were deriding,
  saying: These filled themselves with new wine,' but others were saying: These
  are drunken.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Petros stood (up)
  with the eleven also, he lifted up his voice, he answered them, [The] men,
  [the] Jews and all they who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be manifested to
  you, and listen to my words. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For (it
  is) not as ye (pron.) think, that these are drunken; for it is the third hour
  of the day; <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> but this is that which he
  said through the prophet Iōēl: <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> 'It
  shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I shall pour out from my
  spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and
  your young men shall see visions; and your old men shall dream dreams;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and even I shall pour out from my
  spirit upon my servants and my handmaids in that day; and they shall
  prophesy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I shall give wonders in
  (the) heaven above, and signs upon (the) earth below; [a] blood, and [a]
  fire, and a blackness of smoke. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> (The)
  sun shall be removed, it shall become darkness; and the moon shall become
  blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And it shall be to every one who will pray (the)
  name of the Lord, (that) he shall be saved.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> [The] men, [the] Israelites, hear these my words,
  Jesus the Nazōreos, a man whom God manifested unto you in powers and signs
  and wonders, which God did through him in your midst according as ye (pron.)
  know. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> This (man), in the ordained
  counsel and the foreknowledge of God, having delivered into (the) hands of
  the lawless, ye crucified and ye killed). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> This whom God raised (up), having loosed the
  pangs of Amenti: because it was not possible that he should be overpowered by
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> For David saith of him: I foresaw
  the Lord before me always; being at my right hand, that I may not be moved:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> therefore my heart was delighted, and
  my tongue was glad; moreover my flesh also shall dwell in [a] hope :
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> because thou shalt not leave my sou/
  in Amenti, neither shalt thou give the holy one of thine to see (the)
  corruption. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The ways of (the) life
  thou manifestedst to me, thou shalt fill me with delight with thy face.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> [The] men our brethren, it is lawful
  to speak to you openly concerning our patriarch David, that he died, and he
  was embalmed, and his sepulchre (is) among us until to-day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Being then a prophet, and knowing that in an oath
  God sware to him from (the) fruit of his loins to make one sit upon his
  throne; <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> having seen then from (the)
  first, he spake concerning (the) resurrection of Christ, that he left him not
  in Amenti, nor did his flesh see (the) corruption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> This [is] Jesus whom God raised (up), this to
  whom all we (pron.) are witness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span>
  Having been exalted at the right hand of God, he received the promise of the
  holy spirit from the Father, he poured out this which ye (pron.) see and ye
  hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For David went not up to (the)
  heaven: he himself saith: The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> until I put thine enemies below thy
  feet."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Assuredly then let the whole
  house of Israel know, that God made him Lord and he made him Christ. This
  [is] Jesus, this whom ye (pron.) crucified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But having heard, their heart was pained, they
  said to Petros and (the) rest of the apostles: What is that which we shall
  (lit. will) do, [the] men, our brethren?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But Petros said to them: 'Repent, and let each of
  you receive baptism unto (the) name of Jesus Christ unto (the) forgiveness of
  your sins; and ye will receive the free gift of the holy spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> For yours is the promise, and your fathers, and
  all who are far off, whom the Lord our God will call.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But in many other words he was witnessing to
  them, and he was entreating them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse
  generation.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> They indeed then who
  received the word were baptised: and there were added to them on that day
  three thousand souls. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But they were
  continuing in the teaching of the apostles, And the fellowship of the
  breaking of the bread, and the prayer. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But a fear was being to every soul. But many
  signs and wonders were being done through the apostles in Jerusalem: but a
  great fear was being upon them all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span>
  But all who believed were being in a place; and all things were being to them
  in common; <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> and they were selling
  their fields and possessions; and they were dividing them among all,
  according as each one had need. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> But
  they were continuing daily in (e) the temple, breaking [a] bread in house,
  and they were taking [a] food in [a] gladness and a pure heart, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> blessing God, having [a] grace with all the
  people. But the Lord addeth to them who are being saved daily, together.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Petros and Iōannēs were going
  up to the temple at (the) hour of the prayer of the ninth hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But there was a man, being lame from (the) womb of
  his mother. This (man) they were wont to carry (lit. raise) daily and lay him
  at (the) door of the gate of the temple which is called (the) beautiful,' for
  him to receive an alms from them who go into the temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> This (man) having seen Petros and Iōannēs going
  into the temple was praying them, wishing to receive an alms from them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Petros looked at him, with
  Iōannēs, he said: 'Look at us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But he
  (pron.) was thinking that he was to receive an alms from them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But Petros said to him: '[A] silver and [a] gold
  are (lit, is) not to me; but that which I have I give to thee. In (the) name
  of Jesus Christ the Nazōreos, rise, walk.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But he caught hold of his hand, he raised him
  (up). But immediately his soles and the ankle bones of his feet were made
  firm. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He sprang up, he stood, he
  walked; and he went into the temple with them, walking, springing up,
  blessing God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And all the people saw
  him, walking, praising God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> but they
  were knowing him, that this is he who was sitting needing alms at the
  beautiful gate of the temple: they all were filled with [a] fear and [an]
  astonishment over this which happened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But he caught hold of Petros and Iōannēs: all the
  people ran off to them at the porch which is called 'that of Solomōn,' being
  in.[a] fear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But Petros having seen,
  answered the people. [The] men, [the] Israelites, because of what a wonder ye
  at this? Or why look ye at us, as though in our power or our piety we did
  this to cause this (man) to walk? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> God
  of Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakōb, God of our fathers glorified his
  servant (lit. child) Jesus; He whom ye (pron.) gave (up); ye denied him
  before Pilatos: he indeed having decided to release him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but ye (pron.) denied the holy, the righteous. Ye
  ask to be released to you a man (a) murderer; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but (the) author of (the) life ye kill, this whom
  God raised from them who are dead; this to whom we (pron.) witness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And in (the) faith of his name, this
  (man) whom ye see and ye know,--his name (is) that which cured him, and the
  faith, (which) is through him, gave to him the soundness before you all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But now, my brethren, I know that ye
  did it in [an] ignorance, as also your rulers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But God fulfilled thus the things which he said
  since (the) first from the mouth of all his prophets for his Christ to
  suffer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Repent then and return for
  your sins to be wiped away, that times of refreshment may come to you from
  before (the) presence (lit. face) of the Lord; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and he shall send to you him whom he
  foreordained, Jesus Christ: <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> this whom
  the heavens must receive until (the) time of restoration of all things, which
  (plur.) God spake from the mouth of his prophets since (the) age (began).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Mōysēs indeed said: The Lord God
  shall raise a prophet to you from your brethren (of) them like me; hearken to
  him according to all things which he will say to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But it shall be to every soul who will not
  hearken to that prophet--that soul shall be wiped away from her people.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And all the prophets since Samuel,
  and those who came after him, spake and proclaimed concerning these days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But ye are (the) sons of the
  prophets, and the covenant which God established with our fathers, saying to
  Abraam: 'All the families of (the) earth shall become blessed in thy seed.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> First indeed God raised his servant
  (lit. child) to you, he sent him to bless you, that each one of you might
  depart from his evil things.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But as they speak to the people the
  priests and the captains of the temple and the Sadducees rose upon them,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> objecting that they were teaching the
  people, and they were proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection [the] from them
  who are dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they put forth (lit,
  brought) their hands upon them, they threw them into ward until the morrow:
  already evening had come. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But many
  from them who heard the word believed; and (the) number of the men who
  believed came to be five thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But
  it came to pass, the morrow having come, (that) the rulers and their
  presbyters and the scribes assembled in Jerusalem; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and Anna and Kaiapha, the chief priests, and
  Iōannēs and Alexandros, and all who were from (the) kindred of the chief
  priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And having set them in their
  midst they were asking them: ' In what power, or in what name do ye (pron.)
  this?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then Petros was filled with the
  holy spirit, he said to them: [The] rulers of the people, and [the]
  presbyters, <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> if we (pron.) to-day are
  examined concerning a good deed which was done to a feeble man, as to by whom
  this man was cured; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> let the deed be
  manifest to you all, and all the people of Israel, that in (the) name of
  Jesus the Nazōreos, this whom ye (pron.) crucified, this whom God raised from
  them who are dead, in this (one) standeth this (man) before you cured.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> This is the stone which was despised
  by you the builders, this became a chief corner (stone). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And there is not another in whom is being (the)
  salvation, nor is there another name below (the) heaven which was given to
  [the] men in which they must be saved. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But having seen the boldness of Petros and
  Iōannēs, and having known that they were men who knew not writing, and were
  unlearned, they were wondering; but they were knowing them, that they were
  being with Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the man also
  they were seeing standing with them cured; but they were not being able to
  resist them in anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But having
  commanded that they should put (lit, throw) them out of the council, they
  were speaking to one another, <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> saying:
  What shall (lit. will) we do to these men? That indeed a sign was done
  through them which is manifest, all who dwell in Jerusalem know: it is not
  possible for us to deny. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But that the
  thing may not spread abroad further among the people, let us threaten them,
  that they speak not to any man in this name.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And having called them they ordered them not to
  utter at all, nor to teach in (the) name of Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But Petros and Iōannēs said to them, If it is
  righteous before God to hearken to you rather than God, judge ye:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> for it is not possible for us (pron.)
  not to speak the things which we saw and which we heard. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But they (pron.) having threatened them, released
  them; they found no pretext against them concerning the manner of pnnishing
  them, because of the people; because all were glorifying God because of that
  which was done. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The man had been more
  than forty years (old), on whom this signal work of curing was done.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But having been released, they came
  unto them of their own, they showed to them all things which the chief
  priests and the presbyters did to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But having heard, they lifted up their voice
  toward God together, they said: Our Master, thou (art) he who made (the)
  heaven and (the) earth, the sea and all things which are in it: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> he who said in the holy spirit from the mouth of
  our father David concerning thy servant (lit, child): "Why cried out
  Gentiles? Peoples meditated empty things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> The kings of (the) earth stood (up), the rulers
  also assembled together to oppose the Lord and his Christ." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For in [a] truth assembled in this city upon thy
  servant (lit, child) Jesus whom thou anointedst, Ērōdēs and Pontios Pilatos,
  with other Gentiles and peoples of Israel, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> to do all things which thy hand and thy counsel
  foreordained to be done. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And now,
  Lord, look upon their angers: give to thy servants to speak in all boldness,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> in (the) stretching forth thy hand
  for healings and signs and wonders, to be done through thy holy servant (lit,
  child) Jesus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And having prayed, the
  place in which they were being assembled was shaken. And they all were filled
  with the holy spirit, and they were speaking the word of God in a great
  boldness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But the multitudes who
  believed were being of one heart and one soul. There was not any one saying
  of any of his goods that they were his own; but (i.) all things were being to
  them in common. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But in [a] great
  power were the apostles giving [the] witness of (the) resurrection, of Jesus
  Christ our Lord: but [a] great grace was being upon all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For there was not he who had need among them: for
  they who had fields were selling them; they were bringing (the) price of the
  things which are sold; <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> they were
  laying them at the feet of the apostles: but they were giving to each that of
  which he had need. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But Joseph, who
  was named 'Barsabas'; from the apostles, which is being interpreted (the) son
  of (the) consolation,' being a Levite, Cypriote in his race, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> having (a) field, he sold it, he brought the
  money, he laid it at (the) feet of the apostles.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But a man also whose name is
  Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a field for its price; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> his wife knowing, he took away by stealth from the
  price of the field, but he brought a part, he laid it at the feet of the
  apostles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But Petros said to him:
  'Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart to say falsehood to the holy spirit,
  and to take away by stealth from the price of the field? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Abiding, was it not abiding to thee? And having
  sold it, was it not under thine authority? Why then puttest thou this thing
  in thy heart, having said falsehood not to man but to God?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Ananias hearing these words fell, he expired.
  But a great fear came upon all who heard these (things). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The young men rose, they wrapped him round, and
  having brought him out, they buried him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But it happened (that), nearly three hours having
  passed, his wife came in, not knowing that which happened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Petros said to her: Say to me whether ye sold the
  field for this silver.' But she said: Yea, for this.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But Petros said to her: Why was this thing agreed
  upon by you to tempt the spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of them who
  buried thy husband are at the doors, they will carry thee out also.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But she fell at his feet, she
  expired. The young men having come in, found her dead; having taken her away,
  they laid her by her husband. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> A great
  fear came upon all the church, and on all who heard these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But through (the) hands of the
  apostles many signs and wonders Were being done among the people; and they
  all were assembling together at the porch of Solomōn. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But among the rest no one dared join himself to
  them, but the people were exalting them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> but the more were adding themselves to the Lord,
  believers many men and women. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So that
  they brought out them who were sick into the streets, and laid them upon beds
  and resting-places, that as Petros is to pass by, at the least his shadow may
  come upon one of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But the
  multitudes of the cities which were around Jerusalem were coming, bringing
  them who were sick, and them who were vexed with the unclean spirits: but all
  these are cured through them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But the
  chief priest rose, and all they who were with him, which (is) (the) sect of
  the Sadducees; they were filled with jealousy; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> they put forth (lit. brought) their hands upon
  the apostles, and they put them into the common prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the
  prison in the night, he brought them out, he said to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> 'Go ye, speak in the temple to the people all the
  words of this life.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But having
  heard, they (rose) early, they went to the temple, they were teaching. But
  the chief priest having risen, and all they who were with him, they assembled
  to the council, and all the elders of (the) sons of Israel, and they sent to
  the prison-house to bring them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But
  the officers having come, found them not in the prison; but having returned,
  they showed to them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> saying: 'We
  found indeed the prison-house shut in all security, and the keepers standing
  at the doors; but (these) having been opened, we found not any within.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But the captains of the temple and
  the chief priests having heard these words, were being amazed concerning
  them, as towhat was this which happened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But one came, he showed to them: Behold, the men
  whom ye put in the prison stand in the temple, teaching the people.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then the captain went with the
  officers, they brought them, not by force; for they wore fearing the people
  lest by any means they should stone them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But having brought them, they set them in the
  council. The chief priest asked them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  saying: 'In an order we ordered you not to teach in this name: lo, ye filled
  all Jerusalem with your teaching; and ye think to bring (the) blood of this
  man upon us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Petros answered and the
  apostles, they said: We ought to hearken to God rather than [the] men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> God of our fathers raised Jesus. This
  (one) upon whom ye (pron.) put forth your hands, having hanged him on a tree:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> this (one) God exalted as prince, as
  saviour with his right hand, to give [a] repentance to Israel, and (the)
  forgiveness of sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And we (pron.)
  in him are witness of these very words: but God gave the holy spirit to them
  who hearken to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But having heard
  these (things) they gnashed their teeth at them, and they were wishing to
  kill them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> One rose (up) in the
  council, he was a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliēl, he was a teacher of the
  law honoured by all the people. He commanded to put (lit. throw) the men
  forth for a little. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> He said to them:
  [The] men, [the] Israelites, give heed to yourselves concerning these men, as
  to what it is which ye do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> For before
  these days rose one called Theutēs, saying that I am (he). Four hundred of
  men in number followed him, and he having been killed, all who were obeying
  him were overthrown, having become nothing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> After this rose Ioudas the Galilean in the days
  of the enrolment, and he drew many after (lit. behind) him, and he also
  perished; all who were obeying him were overthrown. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And now, I say to you, withdraw from these men,
  and release them: because if this counsel or this work is from [the] men,
  then it will be overthrown, <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> If it is
  from God, it is not possible for you to overthrow it, lest haply ye be found
  opposers of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> They hearkened to
  him; they called the apostles; they beat them; they ordered them not to teach
  in (the) name of Jesus; they released them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> They (pron.) indeed then were walking (away)
  rejoicing, from (the) presence (lit. face) of the council, because they were
  made worthy to be dishonoured for this name. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> They were being in the temple daily, and they
  cease not teaching in house, proclaiming Jesus Christ.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But in these days the disciples
  having been multiplied, there was a murmuring of the Greeks against the
  Hebrews, because they were not attending to the daily ministry of their
  widows. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But the twelve apostles called
  the multitude of the disciples, they said to them, The thing is not pleasing
  to us to leave the word of God, and minister at tables. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Make (lit. find) inquiry then, our brethren, for
  seven men from you, witnessed unto, full of (the) spirit and wisdom, that we
  may put them over the need; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and we
  (pron.) may have leisure for the prayer, and the ministry of the word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the word pleased the whole
  multitude: and they chose Stephanos from them, he was a man full of (the)
  faith and the holy spirit, and Philippos, and Prochōros, and Nicanōr, and
  Timōn, and Parmena, and Nikolaos, the stranger, native of (the) Antiochia.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Having set these before the apostles,
  and having prayed, they laid hand upon them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the word of God grew; (the) number of the
  disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; but a great multitude of the
  priests hearkened to (the) faith. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  Stephanos, full of grace and power, was doing great signs and wonders and
  powers among the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But (there)
  rose (up) some from the synagogue, whom they call the Libertines and the
  Cyrenians and the men of Rakoti and the men of (the) Kylikia and [the] Asia,
  questioning (lit, seeking) with Stephanos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they could not oppose the wisdom and the
  spirit in which he was speaking. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then
  came men, saying: We (pron.) heard him saying words of blasphemy at Mōysēs
  and God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But they moved the people
  and the presbyters and the scribes; they rose, they carried him off, they
  brought him into the council, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> they
  set up false witnesses, saying: This man ceaseth not, saying words against
  this holy place and the law: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> for we
  heard him saying, that Jesus the Nazōreos himself will overthrow this holy
  place, he will change the customs which Mōysēs delivered to us.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> They who sat in the council, having all gazed
  upon him, saw his face as (the) face of an angel.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But the chief priest said to him:
  'Are these (things) thus? <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But he
  (pron.) said, [The] men, our brethren and our fathers, hear: God of (the)
  glory manifested himself to our father Abraam, being in [the] Mesopotamia,
  before that he dwelt in Charran, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> he
  said to him: 'Come from thy land and from thy kindred, come to the land which
  I shall (lit. will) show to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Then he came from (the) land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran: but from
  there, after his father died, he removed to dwell in this land, this on which
  ye (pron.) now dwell. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He gave not to
  him an inheritance in it, not even, a step of a foot: he promised to give it
  to him in a possession, and (to) his seed after him, but he had not son.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But God spake thus: Thy seed shall be
  sojourners in a strange land, and they shall make them servants, and they
  shall afflict them four hundred years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And the nation to which they will be servants I (pron.) shall judge, said
  God, and after these (things) they shall come out, they shall serve me in
  this very place.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And he gave to him a
  covenant of (the) circumcision: and thus he begat Isaak, and he circumcised
  him in the eighth day. And Isaak begat Iakōb, Iakōb begat the twelve
  patriarchs. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And the patriarchs were
  jealous of Iōsēph, they sold him into Chēmi; and God was being with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He saved him from all his
  afflictions; he gave to him [a] grace and [a] wisdom before Pharaō (the) king
  of Chēmi; he made him governor over Chēmi and over all his house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But a famine came over all Chemi and
  Chanaan, and a great affliction: and our fathers were not finding corn.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But Iakōb heard that they sell corn
  in Chēmi; he sent our fathers first. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And in the second time Iōsēph manifested himself to his brethren; and (the)
  race of Iōsēph was made known to Pharaō. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Iōsēph sent, he called Iakōb his father and
  all his kindred, Amounting to seventy-five souls. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But Iakōb came down to Chēmi; and be died, he and
  our fathers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And they removed him to
  Sychem, they laid him in the sepulchre which Abraam bought for a price of
  silver from (the) sons of Emōr in Sychem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But according as (the) time of the promise
  concerning which God sware to Abraam approached, the people grew and was
  strengthened, it multiplied in Chēmi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  Until rose another kin over Chēmi, knowing not Joseph. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This (one) dealt craftily with our race, he
  afflicted our fathers, to make them cast out their little children (so as)
  not to keep them alive. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But in that
  time Mōysēs was born; he was exceeding fair; this (one) was nourished three
  months in (the) house of his father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  But having been cast out, (the) daughter of Pharaō took him away.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And Mōysēs was taught all wisdom of
  the men of Chēmi; he was being strong in his words and his works.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But forty years of time having been
  completed, it came upon his heart to visit his brethren, (the) sons of
  Israel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But having seen one being
  wronged, he had compassion, he avenged him who was being afflicted, he killed
  the man of Chēmi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But he was thinking
  that his brethren will understand that God will give [a] salvation to them
  through him. But they (pron.) understood not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But on the morrow he manifested himself to others
  who were disputing, and he was reconciling them for [a] peace, saying: Ye are
  men (and) brethren, why do ye wrong to one another?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But he who did wrong to his neighbour denied him,
  saying: 'Who made thee ruler or judge over us? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Wishest thou (pron.) to kill me, as thou killedst
  the man of Chēmi yesterday?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But
  Mōysēs fled at this word; he was a sojourner in (the) land of Madiam, where
  he begat two sons. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But forty years
  having been completed, an angel manifested himself to him in (the) desert of
  (the) mountain of Sina in a flame of fire upon a bush. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But Mōysēs having seen the vision, wondered: but
  being about to come to behold it, a voice of the Lord came, saying:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> 'I am God of thy fathers, God of
  Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakōb.' But Mōysēs trembled, he dared not
  to behold him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But the Lord said to
  him: 'Loose the shoe from thy feet: for the place upon which thou standest is
  a holy ground. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> In a seeing I saw
  (the) affliction of my people which are in Chēmi; and I heard their groaning,
  I came down to save them. But now come that I may send thee up to Chēmi.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> This is Mōysēs whom they denied,
  saying: 'Who made thee ruler or judge over us?' But this (one) God sent as
  ruler and redeemer by (the) hand of the angel, he who manifested himself to
  him in the bush, <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> he who brought them
  out, Having done signs and wonders in (the) land of Chēmi, and the sea of
  Shari, and in (the) desert forty years. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> This is Mōysēs who said to (the) sons of Israel:
  'God shall raise a prophet to you from your brethren of (them) the figures
  which ye made to worship them. I shall remove you to the parts of Babylon.'
  like me, hearken to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> This (is)
  he who was in the church on (the) desert with the angel who spake to him upon
  (the) mountain of Sina and our fathers. This (one) who received words of life
  to give them to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> This to whom our
  fathers wished not to hearken, but they put him (aside), and they returned in
  their heart up to Chēmi. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Saying to
  Aarōn: 'Make for us gods, those (lit. these) which will go before us: for
  this [is] Mōysēs ho brought us from (the) land of Chēmi, we know not what it
  is which happened to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And they
  made for them a calf in those days, and they offered a sacrifice to the idol,
  and they delighted in the works of their hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But God turned them to minister to the host of
  (the) heaven, according as it is written on (the) book of the prophets: 'Did
  ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices on (the) desert forty years, (the)
  house of Israel? <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And ye took the
  tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rēphan, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> The tabernacle of the witness which our fathers
  were having on (the) desert--as he commanded who spake to Mōysēs, to make it
  according to the figure which he saw. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span>
  This, which having received, our fathers with Iēsou took away in with them in
  (to) the possession of the nations, whom God cast out before (the) face of
  our fathers, until the days of David; <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span>
  who found [a] grace before God. He asked to make a dwelling-place for the God
  of Iakōb: <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> but Solomon built a house
  for him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> But the highest was not
  dwelling in fabrics of hand, according as the prophet saith: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> (The) heaven is my throne, but (the) earth is
  (the) footstool of my feet. What house (is) that which ye will build for me,
  saith the Lord, or what is (the) place of my resting-place? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> Did not my hand make all these things?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> [The] stiff-necked and uncircumcised
  in both their heart and their ears, ye (pron.) always oppose the holy spirit:
  as even your fathers, so (lit. and) also ye. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(52)</span> Which of the prophets did not your fathers
  persecute? And they killed them who before proclaimed (the) coming of the
  righteous one; this whom ye (pron.) gave (up) and ye kill him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Ye (pron.) receive the law as ordinances of
  angels, ye kept it not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> But having
  heard these (things) they were being cut to their heart, and they were
  gnashing their teeth upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> But
  Stephanos, full of the holy spirit and (the) faith, looked up to (the)
  heaven, he saw (the) glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of
  God, <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> and he said: Lo, I see the
  heavens opened, and (the) Son of (the) man standing on the right hand of
  God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> They all cried out in a great
  voice; they stopped their ears, and they ran all together upon him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> they cast him outside of the city;
  they stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the foot of a
  young man, his name being Saulos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> And
  they stoned Stephanos, beseeching, saying: 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> He threw himself upon his knees, he
  cried out in a great voice: Lord, thou shalt not reckon this sin to them.'
  But having said this, he slept.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Saulos was consenting to his
  being killed. But at that time happened a great persecution against the
  church which was in Jerusalem. But all were scattered to the countries of
  [the] Ioudea and (the) Samaria save the apostles only. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But devout men took away Stephanos, and they made
  a great wailing over him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But Saulos
  was fighting against the church, going into the houses, dragging off men and
  women, casting them to (the) prison. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  They indeed then who were scattered were passing (along) preaching good
  tidings of the word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Philippos
  having come into a city of (the) Samaria proclaimed the word of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The multitudes together were giving
  heed to the things which Philippos was saying, in (the) hearing and seeing
  the signs which he was doing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But many
  of them who (had) the unclean. spirits with them, (the spirits) were coming
  from them, crying out in a great voice: but many also paralysed, and some
  being lame, he was curing [them]. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But
  a great joy happened in that city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But
  a man, his name being Simon, was being before in that city, being a sorcerer,
  putting all the nation of (the) Samaria beside itself, saying: 'I (am) a
  great (one).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But to this (man) all
  were giving heed, the small and the great, saying: This is the power of God,
  that which is called "the great."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  They all were giving heed to him, because he had spent a great time deceiving
  them in his magic (plur.). <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> when they
  believed Philippos preaching good tidings to them of the kingdom of God and
  (the) name of Jesus Christ, men and women were coming to be baptised.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But Simon also having believed and
  having been baptised was continuing with Philippos, seeing the signs and the
  great powers being done through him, he was wondering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the apostles who were in Jerusalem having
  heard that [the] Samaria also received the word of God, sent Petros and
  Iōannēs unto them: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> these having come
  thither were praying for them that they might receive the holy spirit:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> for he had not yet come upon any of
  them: but rather they were being baptised unto (the) name of the Lord Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Then they laid hand upon them, and
  they were receiving the holy spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  But Simon having seen that through the laying hand of the apostles they
  receive the holy spirit, brought to them money, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> saying: Give this authority to me also, that he,
  upon whom I shall (lit. will) lay hand, may receive the holy spirit.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But Petros said to him: Thy silver
  with thee shall be unto (the) destruction, because thou thoughtest to get for
  thee through money the free gift of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Part shall not be to thee nor lot in this word:
  for thy heart is not right before God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Repent then from this thy wickedness, and pray
  the Lord; perhaps this thought of thy heart will be forgiven thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I see thee in a gall of a bitterness,
  and a bond of (the) iniquity.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Simōn
  answered, he said: Pray ye (pron.) for me to the Lord, that none of the
  things which ye said shall come upon me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> They then indeed, having witnessed and having
  spoken the word of God, returned to Jerusalem: to many villages of the
  Samaritans they were preaching good tidings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But an angel of the Lord spake to Philippos,
  saying: `Arise, go at (the) hour of midday upon the road which thou comest
  from Jerusalem to Gaza: this is a desert.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he arose, he went: and behold, a man, (an)
  Ethiopian eunuch, (a) powerful (man) of Kandakēs, of the queen of the
  Ethiopians. This (man) was being over all her treasure; he had come to
  worship in Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But he had
  returned, sitting in his chariot, and he was reading in the prophet saēas.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But the spirit said to Philippos:
  'Go, join thyself to this chariot.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span>
  But Philippos ran, he heard him reading in the prophet Ēsaēas. He said to him
  Knowest thou then the things which thou readest?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But he (pron.) said: How is it possible for me to
  know, unless one guide me?' But he prayed Philippos that he should get up and
  sit with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But (the) place which
  was written, which he was reading, was this, As a sheep will be brought to
  (the) slaughter, and as a lamb voiceless before him who sheareth it, thus he
  openeth not his mouth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> his judgement
  was taken away in his humiliation: but his generation who will be able to
  speak; because his life will be taken away from upon (the) earth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But the eunuch answered, he said to
  Philippos: 'I beseech thee show me concerning whom this prophet saith this,
  concerning himself or concerning another.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But Philippos opened his mouth, he began to
  preach good tidings to him of Jesus from this Scripture. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But as they were journeying on the road they came
  upon [a] water. The eunuch saith Behold, [a] water ! What is it which
  stoppeth me from being baptised?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  Omitted <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he commanded to stop the
  chariot: and they came down to the water, both Philippos and the eunuch; and
  he baptised him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But having come up
  from the water a spirit of the Lord carried off Philippos; and the eunuch saw
  him no more; for he was journeying on his road rejoicing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But Philippos was found in Azōtos: he was going
  about, preaching good tidings in all the cities, until he came to
  Kesaria.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Saulos, still full of anger and
  murder of the disciples of the Lord, came unto the chief priest; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> he asked for letters from him to Damaskos unto the
  synagogues; that those, whom he will find, being of the way, the men and the
  women, he might bind and bring into Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But having journeyed, it came to pass (that),
  having approached Damaskos, suddenly shone upon him a light from (the)
  heaven, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and, having fallen upon the
  earth, he heard a voice saying to him: 'Saoul, Saoul, why persecutest thou
  me?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But he said: Who (art) thou,
  Lord?' But he (pron.) said: I am Jesus whom thou (pron.) porsecutest :
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> but rise, go into the city; that which
  is right that thou should do shall be spoken to thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But the men who were walking with him were
  standing, being amazed, hearing the voice though they were not seeing any
  one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But Saulos having risen from upon
  the earth, his eyes were opening, but he was not seeing any one; but they
  caught hold of his hand, they took him away into Damaskos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> He spent three days there, he seeth not, he ate
  not, nor drank. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But there was a
  disciple in Damaskos, his name being Ananias; but the Lord said to him in a
  vision: 'Ananias.' But he (pron.) said: 'Lo, I, Lord.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the Lord said to him: Arise, go to the street
  which is called "that which is straight," seek in (the) house of a Jew for
  him whose name is Saulos, the man of Tharsos: lo, he prayed; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and he saw a man in a vision, his name being
  Ananias; he came in, he laid his hands upon him that he might see.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But Ananias answered: Lord, I heard
  concerning this man by many, concerning all the evil things which he did to
  the saints of thine in Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  in this place also he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all who
  pray to thy name.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the Lord said:
  Go, because this is a chosen vessel for me, being about to bear my name
  before the Gentiles, and the kings, and (the) sons of Israel: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> for I (pron.) shall (lit. will) show to him all
  the pains which he will receive for my name.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But Ananias went, and he entered the house, he
  laid his hands on him, he said: Saoul, my brother, the Lord Jesus (is) he who
  sent me, he who manifested himself to thee on the road on which thou comest,
  that thou mightest see, and be filled with [a] holy spirit.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And quickly fell from his eyes scales; he saw,
  and he rose; he was baptised. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Having
  received [a] food, he was strengthened. But he was some days with the
  disciples who were in Damaskos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And
  immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, that this is (the) Son of
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But all were being amazed who
  heard, saying: 'Is not this he who was troubling them who prayed to this name
  in Jerusalem? And he came to this place for this thing, that he might bind
  them and take them up unto the chief priests.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Saulos rather was increasing in strength' and
  he was troubling the Jews who were in Damaskos, showing to them, that this is
  Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But many days having been
  completed, the Jews took counsel that they might kill him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But to Saulos was shown their counsel; but they
  were keeping the gates by the day and the night, that they might kill him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But the disciples took him away by
  night, they let him down in a basket from upon the wall. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But having come into Jerusalem, he was trying to
  join himself to the disciples: and they all were fearing him, and they trust
  him not that he is a disciple. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But
  Barnabas caught bold of him, he brought him unto the apostles, he spake to
  them in what manner he saw the Lord on the road; and that he spakc to him;
  and in what manner he spake boldly in Damaskos in (the) name of Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he was being in Jerusalem, going
  in and out with them, speaking boldly in (the) name of the Lord Jesus:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> but he was speaking, he was
  questioning the Greeks; but they (pron.) were wishing to lay (lit. bring)
  their hands upon him to kill him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But
  the brethren having known (it), brought him to Kesaria, they sent him into
  Tharsos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The church indeed then of
  all [the] Ioudea and [the] Galilea and (the) Samaria had [a] peace, being
  edified and continuing in the fear of the Lord, and they were going on (lit.
  coming) growing in the consolation of the holy spirit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But it came to pass as Petros was about to pass
  through all the brethren, (that) he came unto the saints who dwelt in Lydda.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But he found a man there, his name
  being Enea, having spent eight years prostrate upon a bed; but he was [being]
  paralysed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But Petros said to him:
  'Enea, Christ Jesus healeth thee: rise, make thy bed.' Immediately he rose.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But all they who dwelt in Lydda and
  Sarōn saw him, they who turned to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But in Ioppē there was a female disciple, her
  name being Tabitha, who is interpreted and called 'the Gazelle'; she was
  being full of good work and the alms which she was doing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But it came to pass in those days (that) she
  sickened, she died. But having washed her, they laid her in the upper place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But Lydda was being near to Ioppē:
  the disciples then, having heard that Petros is there, sent two men to him,
  saying, (and) praying him: 'Delay not to come to us.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But Petros arose, he walked with them. But he
  having come, they took him away into the upper place; all the widows stood by
  him weeping, showing to him the coats and the garments (which) the Gazelle
  (was) making, being with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Petros
  put (lit. threw) them all out; having thrown himself upon his knees, he
  prayed; having turned himself to the body, he said: Tabitha, rise.' But she
  (pron.) opened her eyes; but having seen Petros, she sat (up). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> But he helped her, he made her stand. But having
  called the saints and the widows, he presented her to them alive.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But this work was manifested in all
  Ioppē: and many believed the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span>
  But he abode many days in Ioppē with one Simōn' the tanner.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But there was a man in Kesaria, his
  name being Kornēlios, being a centurion from the band which is called 'the
  Italian,' <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> being pious, fearing God
  with all his house, doing much alms to all the people, praying to God always.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> He saw in a vision manifestly an angel
  of God: he went in unto him in (the) ninth hour: he said to him, Kornēlie.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But he (pron.) having gazed at him,
  having been in [a] fear, said: 'What is (son) it, Lord?' But he said to him:
  'Thy prayers and thine alms came up for a remembrance before God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Now then send men to Ioppē; let them
  call one "Simon," who is called "Petros." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He (lit. this) lodgeth with one "Simon" the
  tanner, whose or defiled.' house is by the sea.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The angel who spake to him having gone, he called
  two servants of his and a pious soldier from them who waited upon him;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> having said all things before them he
  sent them to loppē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But on the (lit.
  his) morrow (as they were) walking in the way, and having approached the
  city, Petros went up on the housetop to pray at the sixth hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But he had been hungry, he was wishing to eat:
  but as they prepare for him, a trance came upon him; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> he saw (the) heaven opened. And a vessel let down
  as a great sheet of four corners; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  being in it all the quadrupeds and the creeping things of (the) earth and the
  birds of (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And a voice
  came to him: 'Rise, Peter, slay and eat.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But Petros said: 'Not so, Lord; because I never
  ate anything unclean <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Again came to
  him the voice (the) second time: The things which God cleansed do not thou
  (pron.) indeed make them unclean.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  But this was done even three times, and the vessel was taken away up to (the)
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But as Petros was thinking in
  himself what was (He) the vision which he saw, behold, the men whom Kornēlios
  sent, having asked for (the) house of Simon, stood at the porch. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Having called, they were asking: Doth Simon who
  is called "Petros" lodge here?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But
  as Petros was meditating in himself concerning the vision, [but] the spirit
  said to him: Lo, three mon seek for thee: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but rise, go down, and walk with them, doubting
  not: because it is I who sent them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  But Petros having come down unto the men, said: Lo, it is I whom ye seek for;
  what is the thing concerning which ye came?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But they (pron.) said: Kornēlios the centurion is
  a righteous man and fearing God, being witnessed unto by all the nation of
  the Jews. It was shown to him by a holy angel to send for thee into his
  house, to hear words from thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He
  called them in, he received them. But on the morrow he rose, he came forth
  with them, and other brethren from Ioppē came forth with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But on the morrow they came into Kesaria. But
  Kornēlios was expecting them. And he called his kinsfolk and his near
  neighbours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But it came to pass
  (that) Petros having come in, Kornēlios met him; he threw himself down at his
  feet, he worshipped. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But Petros
  raised him, saying: `Rise; I also am a man.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And he went in, he spake to them: and he found
  many assembled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He said to them: Ye
  (pron.) know that it is unlawful for a man (being a) Jew to join himself to
  or to walk with an alien; and (yet) to me (pron.) God showed, not to say of
  any man that he <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Therefore I came, ye
  having sent for me, I made not objection; I ask then concerning what thing ye
  sent for me?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And Kornēlios said:
  'Four days ago until this hour I was praying at (the) ninth hour in my house:
  behold, a man stood before me in [a] white raiment, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and he said: "Kornēlie, thy prayer was heard, and
  thine alms were remembered before God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Send then into Ioppē; let them call Simon who is
  called 'Petros,' he lodgeth at (the) house of Simon the tanner by the sea."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Now then I sent for thee then; but
  thou (pron.) didst well having come. Now we (pron.) all are here, being
  before God, to hear all the things which the Lord ordained to thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But Petros having opened his mouth,
  said: In [a] truth I see that God is not a respecter of persons: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> but in every nation (he) who feareth him, and who
  worketh the righteousness is accepted with him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> He sent his word to (the) sons of Israel
  preaching good tidings of [a] peace through Jesus Christ, he is the Lord of
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Ye (pron.) know the word which
  came in all [the] loudea, having begun from [the] Galilea, after the baptism
  which Iōannēs proclaimed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Jesus the
  Nazarene, according as God anointed him in a holy spirit and [a] power: he
  who came to do the good, and healing every one over whom the devil had power,
  because God was being with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And
  we (pron.) are witness of all things which he did in (the) country of the
  Jews and in Jerusalem. He whom they killed, and they hanged him on a tree
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> This (one) God raised in the third
  day, and he gave him to manifest himself, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> not to all the people, but to the witnesses whom
  God chose before, that is us, namely we who ate and we drank with him after
  he rose from them who are dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And
  he ordered us to proclaim to the people, and to witness, that this is he whom
  God ordained judge of them who are alive and them who are dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> This of whom all the prophets witness, that
  through his name all who believe him should receive (the) forgiveness of
  their sins.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> As Petros was yet
  speaking these words, the holy spirit came upon 'all who heard the word.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And they of (the) circumcision, the
  faithful who came with Petros, were amazed, because the free gift of the holy
  spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> For they were hearing them speaking in tongues,
  and exalting God. Then Petros answered: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Is it possible for any to forbid the water, that
  these should not be baptised, these who received the holy spirit as we also
  (did)?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> But he commanded them to
  baptise them in (the) name of Jesus Christ. Then they besought him to abide
  with them some days.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But the apostles and the brethren
  who were in [the] Ioudea heard that the Gentiles received the word of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> When Petros went into Jerusalem, they
  of (the) circumcision pleaded against him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> saying: Thou wentest in unto men uncircumcised,
  and thou atest with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Petros
  having begun, was speaking to them, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I (pron.) was being in Ioppē the city, praying:
  and I saw in a trance a vision, a vessel as a great sheet coming down, let
  down by four corners from (the) heaven; and it came unto me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This having gazed at, I was giving heed; and I saw
  the beasts of (the) earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and
  the birds of (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I heard
  a voice also, saying: Rise, Peter, slay and eat.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I said: Not so, Lord, because never did
  anything unclean or defiled go into my mouth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But the voice answered (the) second time from
  (the) heaven, saying: The things which God cleansed do not thou (pron.) make
  them unclean.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But this was done even
  three times: and everything <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  behold, immediately three men stood at (the) door of the house in which I was
  being, having been sent to me from Kesaria. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the spirit said to me: 'Go with them,
  doubting not anything.' But these six brethren also came with me; and we wont
  into (the) house of the man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But he
  showed to us how he saw the angel in his house, standing and saying angel:
  'Send to Ioppē, and call Simon who is called "Petros"; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> he will speak to thee words, those (lit. these)
  in which thou and all thy house will be saved.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I having begun to speak, the holy spirit came
  upon them, as he came upon us at first. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But I remembered (the) word of the Lord, how he
  was saying: Iōannēs indeed baptised in [a] water; but ye (pron.) will be
  baptised in [a] holy spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If then
  God gave to them the equal free gift, who believed the Lord Jesus Christ as
  we also (did), who (was) I indeed to stop God?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But having heard these things they held their
  peace, and they glorified God, saying: Then God gave the repentance to the
  Gentiles also unto (the) life.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They
  indeed then who were scattered since the tribulation which happened at (the
  time of) Stephanos came even unto [the] Phoinikē and Kypros and (the)
  Antiochia, and spake to none the word except the Jews only. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But there were some from them, Kyprian men, and
  some Kyrinnean, these having come to (the) Antiochia were speaking to the
  Greeks, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span>
  And (the) hand of the Lord was being with them: but a great multitude
  believed, and they turned to the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But the word went unto (the) ears of the church
  which was in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas unto (the)
  Antiochia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He having come, and having
  seen the grace of God, rejoiced; and was encouraging all in [the] exhortation
  to stay in the Lord: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> because he was a
  good man, full of the holy spirit and (the) faith. And a great multitude
  followed the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But having come to
  Tharsos, seeking for Saulos; <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and
  having found him, he brought him into (the) Antiochia. But it came to pass
  (that) having spent a whole year, assembling in the church, they taught a
  great multitude: but the disciples who were in (the) Antiochia were named
  first `the Christians.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But in those
  days came prophets from Jerusalem to (the) Antiochia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But one from them rose, his name being Agabos, he
  signified through the holy spirit a great famine about to happen over the
  whole world, which is that which happened at (the time of) Klaudios.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But the disciples, according as each
  one had means, each of them decided for [a] ministry to send to the brethren
  who dwelt in [the] Ioudea; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> this
  having done, to send (it) to presbyters through Barnabas and Saulos.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But in that time Ērōdēs (the) king
  brought his hand <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he killed Iakōbos
  (the) brother of Iōannēs with (the) sword. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But having seen the thing was pleasing to the
  Jews, he went on (lit, added) to arrest Petros also. But the days wore
  (those) of the unleavened (plur.). <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Him
  having arrested, he put in the prison, having delivered him to four bands of
  soldiers to keep him, thinking to bring him up to the people after the
  Paseha. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Petros indeed then was being
  kept in the prison: but the church was praying for him greatly to God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But when Ērōdēs was about to bring him
  up, in that night Petros was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
  chains: but there were keepers at the doors keeping the prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And behold, an angel of the Lord came, and a light
  shone in the house: but having shaken (the) side of Petros, he raised him
  (up), saying: 'Rise quickly.' And the chains fell from his hands.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the angel said to him: Gird
  thyself, and put (lit. give) thy sandal to thy foot.' But he did thus. And he
  said: 'Fold thee with thy garment, and walk after me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having come out, he was walking after him; and
  he was not knowing that (it was) true which was being done through the angel,
  but he was thinking that (it was) a vision which he saw. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But having passed from the first place of keeping
  and the second, they came to the iron gate which cometh out to the city; this
  opened to them of itself: but having come out, they passed (through) one of
  the streets; and immediately the angel went from him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But Petros having come to himself, said: 'Now I
  know truly that the Lord sent his angel and he saved me from (the) hand of
  Ērōdēs, and all (the) expectation of the people of the Jews.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But having seen, he went to (the) house of Maria
  (the) mother of Iōannes who is called Markos,' the place in which many were
  assembling, praying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But Petros
  having knocked at (the) door of the porch, a young maidservant came out to
  answer to him, her name being Rōdē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And having known (the) voice of Petros, from [the] joy she opened not the
  gate, but having run in, she showed to them that Petros stood at the porch.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But they (pron.) said to her: 'Thou
  art mad.' But she (pron.) was affirming that thus it was. But they (pron.)
  said: 'It is his angel.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But Petros
  was continuing knocking: but having opened, and having seen him, they were
  amazed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But he beckoned to them with
  his hand: 'Hold your peace.' And he spake before them in what manner the Lord
  brought him from the prison. But he said to them: 'Show to Iakōbos and the
  brethren these things.' And having come forth, he went to another place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But the day having come, there was no
  small trouble among the soldiers as to what then (is) that which happened to
  Petros. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Ērōdēs having sought for him,
  and having found him not, he tortured the keepers, he commanded to kill them.
  And having come from [the] Ioudea into Kesaria, he abode there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But he was being in [a] wrath, opposing them of
  Tyros and Tsidōn: but they came together unto him. And having persuaded
  Plastos, who was over the chamber of (the) king, they were asking [a] peace,
  because that their country was being nourished from his kingdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But on a day ordained Ēroōdēs clothed himself
  with a kingly raiment, and having sat on the judgement seat was speaking to
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But the multitude was crying
  out, saying: 'This is a voice of god, and it is not that of man.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But immediately an angel of the Lord
  smote him, because that he glorified not God: and having been eaten of worms,
  he died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But the word of God grew and
  was going on (lit. coming) multiplying. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Barnabas and Saulos returned from Jerusalem,
  having completed the ministry, having brought Iōannēs also who was named
  'Markos:</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But there were prophets and
  teachers in the church of (the) Antiochia, Barnabas, and Simōn who is called
  Niker,' and Loukios the Kyrinnean, and Manaē the foster-brother of Ērōdēs the
  Tetraarchēs, and Saulos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But as they
  are ministering to the Lord, fasting, The holy spirit said: Separate to me
  Barnabas and Saulos for the work to which I called them.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Then having fasted and having prayed, they laid
  hand upon them, and they sent them away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They (pron.) indeed, then, having been sent by the
  holy spirit, went into Seleukia; from there they sailed to Kypros.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And having come to Salaminē, they were
  proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: but Iōanēs also
  was being with them, being minister. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span>
  But having passed (through) the whole island even unto Paphou, they found a
  man, sorcerer, false prophet, Jew, his name being Bariēsou, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> who was being with the proconsul Sergios Paulos,
  an understanding man. But he called Barnabas and Saulos, he was seeking to
  hear the word of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But Elymas the
  sorcerer was the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
  synagogue sent to them, saying, [The] men, our brethren, he who hath a word
  of exhortation among you unto the people, say it. opposing them, for his name
  is interpreted (was) thus, seeking to pervert the proconsul from (the) faith;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> but Saulos, who is Paulos, having been
  filled with the holy spirit <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> said, O
  he who is full of (it) all subtlety and all evil, (the) son of the devil, the
  enemy of all righteousness, ceasest thou not perverting the straight ways of
  the Lord? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And now, behold, (the) hand
  of the Lord shall come upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing (the)
  sun unto a season. And immediately came upon him a mistiness and a darkness;
  he was going about asking for him who will help him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then the proconsul having seen that which was
  done, believed; he wondered at the teaching of the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But they of Paulos and Barnabas having come from
  Paphou, came to Pergē of [the] Pamphilia. But lōannēs separated from them, he
  returned into Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But they
  (pron.), having come from Pergē, went to (the) Antiochia of [the] Pisidia;
  and having come to the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But after the reading of the law and
  the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, [The] men, our
  brethren, he who hath a word of exhortation among you unto the people, say
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But Paulos having risen, and
  having beckoned with his hand, said, [The] men, [the] Israelites, and they
  who fear God among you, hear. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> God of
  the people of Israel chose our fathers and he exalted the people in the
  sojourn in (the) land of Khēmi, and with an exalted arm he brought them out
  of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he nourished them forty
  years time in (the) desert. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  having hurled (out) seven nations in (the) land of Chanaan, he caused them to
  inherit their land <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> four hundred
  years: and after these things he gave judges until Sammiēl the prophet.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And from there they asked for a king:
  and God gave to them Saoul (the) son of Kis, a man from (the) tribe of
  Benjamin, forty years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And having
  removed him, he raised (up) David to them as king; this concerning whom he
  witnessed having said: I found David (the) son of Iesse, a man according to
  my heart, this (one) who will do all things which I will.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And from (the) seed of this (one) God according
  to a promise brought to Israel a saviour, Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Iōannēs having first proclaimed before his
  entrance a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Iōannēs having completed his course was
  saying, Who think ye that I (am)? For I am not (he), but lo, coming after me
  (is) he whose shoe of his feet I am not worthy to unloose.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> [The] men, our brethren, [the] sons of (the) race
  of Abraam, and they who fear God among you, [ye] to whom was sent the word of
  this salvation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For they who dwell in
  Jerusalem and their rulers also of this were ignorant, and also (of) the
  voices of the prophets, these which are read on every sabbath, having judged
  (him), having fulfilled them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and
  having not found any cause of (the) death in him, they asked Pilatos to kill
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But having fulfilled all things
  which were written concerning him, they put him down from the tree (lit.
  wood), they put him within a sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But God raised him from them who are dead,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> he who manifested himself many days
  to them who came with him from [the] Galilea into Jerusalem, these now who
  witness to him unto the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And
  we (pron.) preach good tidings to you, of the promise which was made to (lit.
  in) the fathers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> that God fulfilled
  this to the children, having raised Jesus; as it is written in the second
  psalm: Thou art my son, I begat thee to-day.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But that he raised him from them who are dead,
  (and) he will no more return to (the) corruption, He said thus: shall give to
  you the holy (things) of David which are sure.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Therefore again he saith in another place: Thou
  shalt not give to the holy (one) of thine to see (the) corruption.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> For David indeed in his generation
  was serving the counsel of God, he fell asleep, and he was laid with his
  fathers, and he saw (the) corruption: <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span>
  but he whom God raised saw not (the) corruption. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Let the thing then be manifested to you, [the]
  men, our brethren, that through this (man) is proclaimed to you (the)
  forgiveness of your sins: and from all the things in which ye could not be
  justified in (the) law of Mōysēs, <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  [but] in this (one) all who believe will be justified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> See, then, lest by any means that which he said
  in the prophets come upon you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> See,
  [the] despisers, and wonder and turn yourselves, because I shall (lit. will)
  do a work in your days, a work which ye believe not, if one should declare it
  to you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But coming forth, they were
  thinking right that they should speak on the next sabbath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But the synagogue having been dismissed, many of
  the Jews, and they who were devout among the strangers, walked after Paulos
  and Barnabas (who were) persuading them to abide in the grace of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> But on the next sabbath almost the
  whole city assembled to hear the word of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> But the Jews having seen the multitudes, were
  filled with jealousy, and they were opposing the things which Paulos was
  saying, (and) blaspheming. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> But Paulos
  and Barnabas were emboldened, they said: It was necessary to speak to you
  first the word of God. Since ye cast it away from you, and ye reckon
  yourselves not to be worthy of the eternal life, lo, we shall (lit. will)
  turn to the Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> For this is as
  the Lord ordered us: "I put thee for a light of the Gentiles, to be for a
  salvation unto the end of the earth."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> But the Gentiles having heard, rejoiced, and they
  were glorifying the word of God. And all they who were ordained to the
  eternal life believed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> But they were
  going about with the word of the Lord in all the country. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> But the Jews were instigating the devout women,
  and those of honourable estate, and the first (men) of the city, and they
  raised a persecution against Paulos and Barnabas, and they cast them away
  from their boundaries. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> But they
  (pron.) shook off (the) dust of their feet against (lit. upon) them, they
  came into Ikonion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> But the disciples
  were being full of joy and the holy spirit.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles14">14</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But it Came to pass in Ikonion
  according to the same manner that they went into the synagogue of the Jews,
  and spake thus so that a great multitude believed of the Jews and the Greeks.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But the Jews who were disobedient
  arose, and they gave pain to the souls of the Gentiles concerning the
  brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They indeed then spent a
  great time there, speaking openly in (the) name of the Lord. He who witnessed
  for (the) word of his grace, giving signs and wonders to be done through
  their hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But the multitude of the
  city was divided. Some indeed were being with the Jews, but others were being
  with the apostles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the Gentiles
  having run with the Jews and their rulers also to insult them and to stone
  them, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> they having seen, fled into the
  cities of Lykaonia, Lystra, and Terbē, and the region, round about.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They were preaching good tidings
  there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And there was a man impotent in
  his feet in Lystra; he was sitting, being lame since he was in (the) womb of
  his mother; he walked not ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  this (man) heard Paulos speaking. But he (pron.) having gazed at him, and
  having known that there was faith in him to be saved, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he said in a great voice: 'Arise, stand upon thy
  feet.' And he was springing up, and he was walking. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The multitudes indeed then having seen that which
  Paulos did, lifted up their voice in Lykaonian, saying: The gods became as
  the men, they came down unto us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They
  were calling indeed Barnabas [the] Zeus,' but Paulos Ethel Ermēs,' since he
  (pron.) was chief of the word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  the priest of [the] Zeus, who was being before the city, brought calves and
  crowns up to the porches, he was wishing to slay, with the multitude.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the apostles Barnabas and Paulos
  having heard, rent their garments, they ran unto the multitude, crying out,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> saying: '[The] men, why do ye these
  (things)? We also are men, men of passion like you, preaching good tidings to
  you, to depart from the vanities and to turn to the living God, he who made
  (the) heaven and (the) earth and the sea, and all things which are in them:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> he who was in the generations which
  passed (by); he let all the nations walk in their ways. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And yet he let not himself be without witness,
  doing good things, he gave to them rains from (the) heaven and fruitbearing
  times, satiating your hearts with food and delight.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And saying these (things) scarcely they caused
  the multitude to be quiet (so as) not to slay to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But Jews went from (the) Antiochia and Ikonion,
  they persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paulos, and they dragged him
  outside of the city, thinking that he died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But as the disciples were around him, having
  risen, he came into the city. And on the (lit. his) morrow he came forth with
  Barnabas into Terbē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But having
  preached good tidings in that city, and having taught a great multitude, they
  returned into Lystra and Ikonion and (the) Antiochia, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> confirming the souls of the disciples,
  encouraging them to stay in the faith, and that through much tribulation we
  must go into the kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But
  they laid hand upon presbyters for them in every church; and having prayed in
  fastings, they committed them to the Lord, whom they believed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But having passed (through) [the] Pisidia, they
  came to [the] Pamphylia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And having
  spoken the word in Pergē, they came into Attalia; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and from there they sailed to (the) Antiochia,
  the place in which they were given in the grace of God for the work which
  they completed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But having come, and
  having assembled the church, they were showing to them concerning all things
  which God did with them; and that he opened a door of (the) faith to the
  Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But they abode there with
  the disciples not a little time.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles15">15</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And some having come from [the]
  Ioudea, were teaching the brethren, that if ye should not be circumcised
  according to (the) custom of Mōysēs it is not possible for you to be saved.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But no little trouble having happened
  to Paulos and Barnabas and others of thern, they ordained Paulos and Barnabas
  to go unto the apostles and the presbyters who were in Jerusalem to see
  concerning this question. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> They (pron.)
  indeed then having been escorted by the church, passed through [the] Phoinikē
  and (the) Samaria, speaking concerning (the) return of the Gentiles: and they
  were making a great joy with all the brethren. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But having come into Jerusalem, they of the church
  and the apostles and the presbyters received them; but they showed to them
  all things which God did with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  But some from (the) sect of the Pharisees who believed arose, saying: It is
  right that they should circumcise them, and to order to keep (the) law of
  Mōysēs.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But the apostles and the
  presbyters assembled to see concerning this word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But a great questioning having happened, Petros
  stood, he said to them, [The] men, our brethren, ye (pron.) know that since
  the early days God chose among you from my mouth to cause the Gentiles to
  hear (the) word of the Gospel, and believe. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And God, he who knoweth the hearts, witnessed to
  them, and he gave to them the holy spirit, as he gave to us also;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> and he put not any difference between
  us and them, having cleansed their hearts in the faith. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now then why tempt ye God, to place a yoke on
  (the) shoulders of the disciples, this which not our fathers nor we (pron.)
  could bear? <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But through the grace of
  our Lord Jesus we believe that we shall be saved, according as the others.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But all the multitude was silent, and
  they were hearing Barnabas and Paulos speaking of all the signs and the
  wonders which God did among the Gentiles through them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But after they were silent, Iakōbos answered,
  saying, [The] men, our brethren, hear me: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Symeōn spake how at first God visited, to take a
  people from the Gentiles in his name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  And with this agree the words of the prophets; according as it is written :
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> 'After these things I shall return,
  and I shall build the tabernacle of David, which was fallen; and the things
  which were overturned of it I shall build: and I shall (lit. will) set it up:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> that (the) rest of [the] men may seek
  for the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name was called, saith the
  Lord, he who caused these things <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> to
  be manifest since (the) age. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  'Therefore I (pron.) give judgement, not to molest them who will turn from
  the Gentiles; <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but to send to them, to
  cause them to depart from things slain for idols, and [the] fornication, and
  things strangled, and the dead blood (plur.). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For Mōysēs since the early generations hath them
  who proclaim him in every city in the synagogues, being read on every
  sabbath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Then it seemed good to the
  apostles and the presbyters with the whole church to choose men from them, to
  send them to (the) Antiochia with Paulos and Barnabas; Ioudas, who is called
  Barsabbas,' and Silas, chief men among the brethren: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> having written through them, The apostles and the
  presbyters to the brethren who are in (the) Antiochia and [the] Kylikia and
  [the] Syria, the brethren who are of the Gentiles, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Since we heard that some from us having come
  forth troubled you, perverting your souls in words, these which we said not;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> it seemed good then to us, having
  come together, to choose men to send them to you with our beloved Barnabas
  and Paulos, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Men who gave their soul
  for (the) name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But we sent Ioudas and Silas, they also shall
  show to you the same things through (the) word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> For it pleased the holy spirit and us also, not
  to put more burden upon you except these of necessity. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Keep yourselves from them, the things slain for
  idols, and the dead blood (plur.), and things strangled, and [the]
  fornication; keeping yourselves from these and doing well. Farewell.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> They (pron.) indeed then having been
  dismissed, came to (the) Antiochia; and having assembled the multitude, they
  gave the epistle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But having read,
  they rejoiced for the consolation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  Ioudas and Silas, (who) were prophets also, through many a word consoled the
  brethren and assured them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But having
  spent some time with them, they were dismissed in [a] peace to go unto them
  who sent them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Omitted <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But Paulos and Barnabas abode in (the) Antiochia,
  teaching and preaching good tidings, with many others, of the word of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But after some days said Paulos to
  Barnabas: 'Let us return and visit our brethren in every city, those in which
  we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see what happened to them.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But Barnabas was wishing to take away
  Iōannēs also with them, who is called Markos.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But Paulos was thinking good that him who
  separated from them since (the) Pamphylia, and who came not with them to the
  work, they should not take with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  But [an] anger arose, so that they separated from one another; but Barnabas
  took Markos, he sailed to Kypros; <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> but
  Paulos chose Silas, he came forth, having been delivered to the grace of God
  by the brethren. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> But he was passing
  through (the) Syria and (the) Kylikia confirming the churches.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But he came into (the) Terbē also
  and Lystra: and lo, a disciple was being there, his name being Timotheos,
  (the) son of a believing Jewess; but his father was a Greek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Concerning this (man) were witnessing the brethren
  who were in Lystra and Ikonion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Him
  Paul wished to come forth with him; and having taken him away, he circumcised
  him, because of the Jews who were in that place: for they all were knowing
  that his father was a Greek. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But going
  round among the cities they were delivering to them to keep the decrees which
  were established by the apostles and the presbyters who were in Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The churches indeed then were going on
  (lit. coming) being confirmed in the faith, and they were going on (lit.
  coming) multiplying in their number daily. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But they passed through [the] Phrikia and the
  country of [the] Galatia, the holy spirit having prevented them from speaking
  the word of God in [the] Asia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But
  having come into the places of [the] Mysia, they were trying to go to [the]
  Bēthenia; and the spirit of Jesus was not allowing them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But having passed from [the] Mysia, they came into
  Trōas. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And a vision. was manifested to
  Paulos in the night; a man of Makedon standing, praying him, saying: 'Come to
  (the) Makedonia, help us.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But when
  we saw the vision we immediately sought for coming to (the) Makedonia,
  considering that God called us to preach good tidings to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But having come from Trōas, we went quickly to
  Samothrakē: but (on) the (lit. his) morrow we came into Neapolis;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> and from there we came to Philippois,
  which [it] is the first (city) of the district of (the) Makedonia, a colony
  city: but we were abiding in that city some days <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But on the day of the sabbaths we came outside of
  the city by the river, the place (of which) we were thinking that there would
  be [a] prayer there. And having sat, we were speaking to the women who came
  forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And a woman, her name being
  Lydia, being a seller of purple, of a city called Thyatērōn, worshipping God,
  was hearing. This (one) God opened her heart, to attend to the things which
  Paulos was saying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But having been
  baptised, and her house, she besought us, saying: 'If ye reckoned me faithful
  to the Lord, come into my house, abide.' And she took us by force.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But it came to pass (that) as we were
  going to the prayer a young maidservant, there being a spirit of divination
  with her, met us, she who was giving much profit to her masters, being (a)
  diviner. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> She having walked after
  Paulos and us, was crying out, saying: 'These men are servants of most high
  God; these who proclaim to you a way of salvation.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But this she was doing many days. But Paulos,
  having been grieved, and having turned to the spirit, said: I order thee in
  (the) name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.' And he came out in that hour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But her masters, having seen that the
  hope of their profit came out of her, laid hold on Paulos and Silas; they
  dragged them away to the marketplace unto the rulers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having brought them to the captains, they
  said: These men trouble our city being Jews: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> and they proclaim to us other customs, these
  which it is not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the multitude rose upon them; and
  the captains rent their garments, they commanded that they should beat them
  with (the) staff. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Having given to
  them many stripes, they cast them to the prison, having ordered the jailor a
  to keep them securely. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> This (man)
  having received an order of this kind, cast them into the inner prison, and
  he secured their feet to the wood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  But at midnight Paulos and Silas, praying, were blessing God: they all his
  house. who were bound were hearing them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> suddenly happened a great earthquake, so that the
  foundations of the place of binding were moved: but immediately all the doors
  were opened; and all the bands of theirs were loosed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But the jailor having woke, and having seen the
  doors of the prison open, drew his sword, being about to kill himself,
  thinking that they who were bound fled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But Paulos cried out in a great voice, saying: 
  ‘Do not any evil to thyself: for we are all here.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But he took a light; he ran in, and having been
  in a trembling, cast himself down at the feet of Paulos and Silas;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> and having brought them out, he said
  to them: 'My masters, what ought I to do that I may be saved? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But they (pron.) said: 'Believe the Lord Jesus,
  and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And they spake to him the word of the Lord, him
  and all his house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And he took them
  away in that hour of the night, he washed their wounds; and he was baptised,
  he and <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But baving brought them into
  his house, he put a table before them, and was being glad and all his house,
  having believed God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But the day
  having come, the captains sent lictors, saying: 'Release those men.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But the jailor showed to Paulos these
  words: The captains sent that ye should be released: now then come forth, go
  in [a] peace.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But Paulos said to
  them: Having beaten us publicly, being Roman men, (when) also we are not
  condemned, they cast us to (the) prison; and they cast us (pron.) out
  secretly. Nay, but let them come themselves and bring us out.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> The lictors showed to the captains these words:
  but they feared, having heard that they were Romans. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And having come, they entreated them, and having
  brought them out, they besought them to go out of their city. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But having come out of the prison, they went into
  (the) house of Lydia, and having seen, they comforted the brethren, and they
  came forth.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles17">17</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Having passed through [the]
  Amphipolis and [the] Apollōnia, they came to Thessalonikē, the place in which
  there was a synagogue of the Jews: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> but
  according to the custom of Paulos, he went in unto them, and he was speaking
  to them from the Scriptures for three sabbaths, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> manifesting and putting (it) before them, that
  Christ must suffer and rise from them who are dead, and that Jesus Christ is
  this, this whom I (pron.) proclaim to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And some indeed from them believed, and there were
  numbered with Paulos and Silas a great multitude of them who worship of the
  Greeks, women also of the first (rank) not few. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But the Jews were jealous, and they took men,
  evil, of the baser sort, and having assembled a multitude they troubled the
  city, and they came at (the) house of Iassōn seeking for them that they might
  bring them out to the multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  having not found them, they dragged Iassōn out and other brethren unto the
  rulers of the city, crying out: These are they who troubled the world, and
  they are present here; <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> whom Iassōn
  received. And all these oppose the decrees of (the) king, saying that there
  is another king, Jesus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But they
  troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city hearing these (things).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having taken what is right from
  Iassōn and the rest also, they released them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But the brethren immediately escorted Paulos and
  Silas by night into Beroia: but they (pron.) having come thither, went into
  the synagogue of the Jews. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But these
  were (more) noble than they who were in Thessalonikē: these having received
  the word in all readiness of heart, (were) searching daily in the Scriptures
  whether these things were thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Many
  indeed then from them believed; and some also from the Greeks, women of
  honourable state, and men also not a few. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the Jews of Thessalonike having known that
  Paulos proclaimed in (the) Beroia also the word of God, came to that place
  also, moving the multitudes, troubling them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then immediately the brethren escorted Paulos to
  make him go toward the sea: but Silas and Timotheos were left there.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But they who escorted Paulos brought
  him into Athēnnas. And having received commandment to give message to the
  brethren Silas and Timotheos, that they might come to him quickly, they came
  forth, they went (away). <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But Paulos
  was being in Athēnnas looking out for them. But his spirit was angered within
  him, seeing the city abounding with idolatry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He was speaking indeed then in the synagogue to
  the Jews, and them who worship, and all who assemble daily in the
  marketplace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But some from the
  Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers were encountering him; and others were
  saying: 'What wisheth to say this babbler?' But others were saying that he is
  a proclaimer of strange demons: because he was proclaiming to them Jesus and
  his resurrection. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But they laid hold
  of him, they brought him into the Ariopagos, saying: 'It is possible for us
  to know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Thou bringest strange words into our ears: we
  wish to know what these (things) are.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But all the Athenians and the strangers who came
  thither were spending their time in nothing, except to speak and hear (a) new
  thing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Paulos stood in (the)
  midst of the Ariopagos, he said: [The] men, [the] Athenians, by everything I
  see [you] that ye are worshippers of demons more (than others). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For passing by, and having seen the things which
  ye worship, I found an altar, (and) written upon it, "God whom we know not."
  Him then whom ye worship, (and) ye know him not, this (one) I (pron.)
  proclaim to you: <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> God who made the
  world and all things which are in it, this is the Lord of (the) heaven and
  (the) earth. He was not dwelling in temples formed by hand; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> nor were hands of man wont to serve him, having
  no nead of anything, he (pron.) it is who giveth (the) life and (the) breath
  to all: <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> having made all nations of
  [the] men from one, to cause them to dwell upon (the) face of all (the)
  earth. Having ordained times ordained from (the) first, and the ordinance of
  their dwelling; <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> to cause them to seek
  for God, that haply they will feel after him and find him, although he is not
  far from each one of us: <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> for we lived
  in him and we moved and we existed. As some also from the poets which are
  among you said: "For we (are) his offspring." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> We being an offspring then of God, ought not to
  cause ourselves to think of gold, or silver, or stone graven by art or
  imagination of man that God was like to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The times indeed of the ignorance God let (pass)
  away; but now he proclaimeth to [the] men to cause all to repent in all
  places: <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> according as he established a
  day, in which he will judge the world in [a] righteousness through the man
  whom he ordained; having given assurance to all, having raised him from them
  who are dead.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But having heard 'The
  resurrection of the dead,' some indeed mocked; but others said: We shall hear
  thee concerning this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And thus again
  Paulos came from their midst. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But men
  who believed joined themselves to him; these among whom were being Dionēsios
  the Ariopagitēs, and a woman, her name being Damaris, and others with
  them.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles18">18</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these (things), having come
  from Athēnnēs, he came to Korinthos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  He found a Jew, his name being Akyllas, who was a Pontian in his race, having
  come immediately from [the] Hytalia, and Priskylla his wife, because Klaudios
  had commanded to cause all the Jews to depart from Rōmē. He came unto them;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and he abode with them, because that
  he was a fellow craftsman of his; and they were working, for they were makers
  of tents in their craft. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But they were
  speaking in the synagogue on every sabbath, and they were persuading the Jews
  and the Greeks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Silas and
  Timotheos having come from (the) Makedonia, [but] Paulos was persevering in
  the word, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus is Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But they opposing him and blaspheming, he shook
  out his garments; he said to them: Your blood upon your head; I (pron.) am
  clean: henceforth I shall go to the Gentiles,' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And having removed from there, he came to (the)
  house of one, his name being Titos, this (was) a believer, worshipping God,
  whose house was adjoining to the synagogue. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But Krispos, the ruler of the synagogue, believed
  the Lord with his whole house; and many from the Korinthians hearing were
  believing and were being baptised. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But
  the Lord said to Paulos through a vision in the night: Fear not, but speak,
  and hold not thy peace: <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> because I
  (pron.) am with thee, and no one shall rise upon thee to give pain to thee:
  because I have a great people in this city.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But he sat a year and six months, teaching among
  them the word of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But Galiōn
  being proconsul of [the] Achaia, the Jews came together upon Paulos, and they
  brought him to the place of the judgement, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> saying: This (man) persuadeth [the] men to
  worship God contrary to the law.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But
  Paulos being about to open his mouth, Galiōn said to the Jews: 'If there were
  wrongdoing or wicked villany, O [the] Jews, well: I would bear with you:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but if they are questions concerning
  a word and names and your law ye shall take care (of it) yourselves; I
  (pron.) wish not to be judge of these (things).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he cast them away from the judgement seat.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But they all laid hold on Sōsthenēs,
  the ruler of the synagogue; they beat him before the judgement seat. And it
  was not being a care to Galiōn concerning any of these (things). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But Paulos having abode yet many days with the
  brethren, took leave of them; he sailed to (the) Syria, Priskylla being with
  him and Akyllas; having shorn his head in Konchrees: for he was being in a
  vow. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But he came to Ephesos, and he
  left those there: but he (pron.) having gone into the synagogue was speaking
  to the Jews. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But they praying him
  that he should spend a great time with them, he wished not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but he took leave of them, having said: I shall
  (lit, will) return to you in the will of God.' But he sailed from Ephesos.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But having come into Kesaria, and
  having saluted the church, He came into (the) Antiochia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And having spent [a] time there, he came forth,
  passing from place (to place) of the country of [the] Galatia and [the]
  Phrikia, confirming all the disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But there was a Jew, his name being Apellēs,
  being a man of Rakoti in his race, being a notable man, who came to stay at
  Ephesos; being powerful in the Scriptures. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> This (man) had been instructed in the way of the
  Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he was speaking and he was teaching in
  [an] accuracy concerning Jesus, only the baptism of Iōannēs being (that)
  which he knoweth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But this (man)
  began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Priskylla and Akylla having heard
  him, received him, and they showed to him in [an] accuracy the way of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But he wishing to come forth to [the]
  Achaia, the brethren incited him, they wrote to the disciples that they
  should receive him. But this (man) having come, was very profitable to them
  who believed through the grace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> He
  was confuting the Jews in [an] assurance, manifestly showing to them from the
  Scriptures that Jesus is Christ.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But it came to pass, Apellēs being
  in Korinthos, [but] that Paulos having passed by the places which were above,
  came to Ephesos, and having found disciples, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> he said to them: Did ye receive the holy spirit,
  having believed ?' But they (pron.) said: But neither heard we even that
  there is a holy spirit.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But he
  (pron.) said: 'Unto what did they baptise you ?' But they (pron.) said: The
  baptism of Iōannēs.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Paulos said:
  `Iōannēs indeed gave baptism in a water of repentance to the people, saying
  that they should believe him who was coming after him, that is to say,
  Jesus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But having heard, they were
  baptised unto (the) name of the Lord Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Paulos having laid hand on them, the holy
  spirit came upon them. But they were speaking in (the) tongue, and they were
  prophesying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But they (pron.) all were
  being twelve men. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But having gone into
  the synagogue he was speaking boldly three months, speaking and persuading
  them concerning the kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  But some having become hardhearted, being disobedient, speaking evil of the
  way before the multitude, he fled from them, having separated the disciples,
  Speaking daily in the school of Tyrannos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But this he was doing two years; so that all who
  dwelt in [the] Asia heard the word of the Lord, the Jews and the Greeks.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But God was doing mighty works not
  few through (the) hands of Paulos: <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> so
  that they took handkerchiefs and aprons from his body and laid them upon
  those who were sick, and the sicknesses were wont to go from them, and the
  evil spirits were coming out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But
  some from the Jews who went about as exorcists took in hand to say (the) name
  of the Lord Jesus over them who (had) the evil spirits upon them, saying: I
  adjure you by (it) Jesus, whom Paulos proclaimeth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But there were seven sons of one Skeva,' being a
  Jew, chief priest, doing this. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The
  evil spirit answered, he said to them: Jesus I know, and Paulos also I know,
  but who are ye?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the man with
  whom the evil spirit (was) threw himself upon them, he mastered them
  together, he prevailed over them, so that they fled from that house naked
  with their heads wounded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But this
  became manifested to all the Jews and the Greeks, who dwelt in Ephesos; and a
  fear came upon them all, and (the) name of the Lord Jesus Christ was going on
  (lit. coming) being exalted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But many
  (sing.) from them who believed were coming, confessing, and saying their
  works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But many (plur.) among them
  who were doing curious arts, having brought their books, burnt them before
  all: and they took count of their prices, having found them being there fifty
  thousand of silver. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But thus mightily
  grew (the) word of the Lord and it prevailed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But these (things) having been completed, Paulos
  purposed in his spirit that, should he pass throughout (the) Makedonia and
  [the] Achaia, he might go to Jerusalem, having said: 'After my going there, I
  must see also Rōmō. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But he sent two
  to (the) Makedonia among them who serve him, Timotheos and Erastos, but he
  (pron.) spent a time in [the] Asia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  But at that time happened no small trouble concerning the way. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For one, his name being Dimētrios, a silversmith
  forming silver temples of [the] Artemis, was giving much of work to the
  craftsmen not few. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He having
  assembled these with the workmen also who were occupied with these (things),
  said: '[The] men, ye know that from this business cometh the getting of gain
  to us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And ye see and ye hear, that
  not only indeed Ephesos, but almost in all [the] Asia this "Paulos" turned
  away a great multitude, saying that these are not gods which are made through
  formings of hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Not only will this
  trade become to us for a danger to cause us to come to [a] reproof; but the
  temple also of the great goddess [the] Artemis will be no more reckoned
  anything, and her greatness will be overthrown, this which all [the] Asia and
  all the world worshippeth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But
  having heard these (things), and having been filled with anger, they were
  crying out, saying: '[The] Artemis of them of Ephesos is great.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And the city was filled with trouble: but all ran
  hurriedly together to the theatre; they carried off Gaios and Aristarchos,
  being Makedonians, they came on travel with Paulos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But Paulos wishing to go into the multitude, the
  disciples were not letting him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But
  some also from the rulers of [the] Asia, being friends to him, sent to him,
  beseeching him not to give himself to the theatre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Others indeed then were crying out saying another
  thing: for the assembly was troubled; and the most of them knew not why they
  were assembled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But from the
  multitude the Jews brought out Alexandros. Alexandros beckoned to them with
  his hand, wishing to make defence to the multitude. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But having known that he is a Jew, there arose
  one shout from all, about two hours, crying out: [The] Artemis of them of
  Ephesos is great.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But the town clerk
  having caused the multitude to be quiet, said: [The] men, [the] Ephesians,
  [for] who among [the] men (is there) who knoweth not (the) city of the
  Ephesians, that it is temple-keeper of the great Artemis and the Diopetēs?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> No one them opposeth these (things).
  It is worthy then that ye should be sedate and do not anything lightly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For ye brought these men hither,
  neither are they temple-robbers, nor do they blaspheme your gods.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> If then Dimētrios and the craftsmen
  also who are with him have a word against any one, the law courts will be
  held, and there is (a) proconsul, let them implead one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But if ye seek for another Matthewter, in the
  regular assembly it shall be decided. <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span>
  For we are even in danger to be accused concerning the trouble of to-day,
  there being no pretext with which it is possible for us to give account for
  the trouble.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And having said these
  (things), he dismissed the assembly.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But after the trouble was ended,
  Paulos sent for the disciples and comforted them, he saluted them, he came
  forth to go to (the) Makedonia. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Having
  passed through that place and having comforted them in many a word, he came
  to [the] Elias. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But having spent three
  months there, an evil plan was made concerning him by the Jews. Being about
  to come to (the) Syria, a plan was made to return through (the) Makedonia.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Sōsipatros of Pyrrus the man of
  Beroia was with him; but (of) them of Thessalonikē, Aristarchus and
  Sekounthos; and Gaios the man of Terbē, and Timotheos; but they of [the]
  Asia, Tyehikos and Trophēmus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But
  these having been before us, stayed for us in Troas. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But we (pron.) after the days of the unleavened
  (plur.) sailed from Philippois, and we came unto them to Trōas in five
  (days), and we abode there with them seven days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But on (the) first (lit. one) of the sabbaths, we
  having assembled to break [a] bread, Paulos was speaking to them, being about
  to come forth on the (lit. his) morrow; but he was spreading out the word
  unto midnight. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But there were many
  lamps in the upper place, the place in which they were being assembled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But a young man was sitting, his name
  being Eutychos, upon the window, forgetting (himself) in a deep (lit. great)
  sleep; but as Paulos was speaking, the sleep overcame him more, he fell down
  from the third storey, and he was taken up dead <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But Paulos came down, he threw himself upon him,
  and having embraeed him, he said: Trouble not; for his life (is) in him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But having gone up, and having broken
  the bread, and having tasted, he prolonged the word until (the) light came
  forth, and thus he came forth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But
  they brought the boy alive, and they received no little consolation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But we (pron.) went before on board
  the ship, we came into Assos arranging to take in Paulos at that place: for
  he had ordered us thus, being about to walk on foot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But having met with us in Assos, we took him in,
  we came to Militinē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But on the
  morrow we sailed from there, we came opposite Chios, but in the evening we
  came to Samos; afterwards we came to Milētos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For Paulos had ordained to sail past Ephesos,
  that he might not delay in [the] Asia, for he was hasting, that, if it were
  possible, he might spend (the) day of the Pentēcostē in Jerusalem.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But from Milētos he sent to Ephesos,
  he called the presbyters of the church. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But they having come unto him, he said to them:
  Ye (pron.) know, since the first day (in) which I came to [the] Asia, in what
  manner I was with you in all this time; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> being servant to the Lord in all humbleness of
  heart, and tears, and the trials which came upon me, in the evil plans of the
  Jews: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> how I hid not anything of the
  things which were profitable, without showing them to you, and teaching you,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> witnessing publicly and in every
  house to the Jews and the Greeks [the] repentance toward God, and the faith
  in our Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And now,
  lo, I (pron.) being bound in the spirit shall (lit. will) go to Jerusalem, I
  know not that which will befall me in it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Except that the holy spirit witnesseth to me in
  every city, saying: "Bonds and afflictions stay for thee." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But my life I put it not, that it is precious to
  me, in any account, until I complete my course and the ministry which I
  received from the Lord Jesus, to witness to the Gospel of the grace of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And now, lo, I (pron.) know that ye
  see my face no more, all ye, they among whom I was passing, proclaiming the
  kingdom of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Therefore, I witness
  to you in this very day that I (pron.) am pure from the blood of you all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For I hid not myself so as not to
  show to you (the) whole wish of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  Take heed to yourselves and all the flock, in which the holy spirit put you
  as overseers, to feed the church of the Lord, which he got through his own
  blood. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But I (pron.) know that after
  my going (away) grievous wolves will come in to you, they will not spare the
  flock; <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> and men will rise from among
  you, saying perverse words, for them to draw the disciples after them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Therefore then watch yourselves,
  remembering that I spent three years, I ceased not by the day and the night
  admonishing each one of you in tears. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span>
  And now I commit you to the Lord and (the) word of his grace, for which it is
  possible to establish and to give inheritance among all them who were
  sanctified. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> [A] silver or [a] gold or
  a garment I coveted not them of any one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Ye (pron.) know that these my hands ministered to
  my need, and (to) them who were with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I showed to you all things, that it is right to
  toil thus and help them who are weak, and for you to remember the words of
  the Lord Jesus, that he (pron.) said: "It is a blessedness rather to give
  than to receive."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And having said
  these (things), he threw himself on his knees with them all; they prayed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But there was a great weeping of all
  of them; and they threw themselves upon (the) neck of Paulos, and they kissed
  his mouth, <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> grieving most concerning
  the word which he said, that they will see his (lit. my) face no more. But
  they were escorting him toward the ship.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But it came to pass (that) having
  put to sea, we separated from them, we sailed with straight courses, we came
  into Kō; but on the (lit. his) morrow we came to Rodos, and from there we
  came to Patara <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and having found a ship
  being about to cross over to [the] Phoinikē, we went on board; we put off.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But having seen Kypros, we left it on
  the left hand, we sailed to (the) Syria, and we came to Tyros: For the ship
  was being about to unlade its freight there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But having found the disciples, we abode there
  with them seven days, these who were saying to Paulos through the spirit not
  to go into Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But it came to
  pass (that) having completed the days, we came forth, we walked (away), all
  of them escorting us, with women also and their children, unto outside of the
  city: and we threw ourselves upon our knees upon the shore, we prayed,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and we took leave from one another, we
  went on board the ship, but they returned to their own. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But we (pron.) sailed from Tyros, we came into
  Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we abode with them a day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But on the (lit. his) morrow having
  come forth, we came to Kesaria, and having gone into (the) house of Philippos
  the preacher of good tidings, being one from the seven, we abode with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But this (man) had four daughters,
  virgins, prophesying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But we having
  abode there many days, One came from [the] Ioudea, being a prophet, his name
  being Agabos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And having come unto
  us, he took away the girdle of Paulos, he bound his hands and his feet, he
  said: These (things) are they which the holy spirit saith: "The man, whose is
  this girdle, the Jews will thus bind in Jerusalem, and will deliver him to
  (the) hands of Gentiles."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But we
  having heard these (things), were beseeching, we and the brethren of that
  place, for him not to go to Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then answered Paulos: 'What do ye, weeping and
  paining my heart? For not only to be bound, but I (pron.) am prepared to die
  in Jerusalem for (the) name of the Lord Jesus.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But he having not been persuaded, we held our
  peace, saying: Let the will of the Lord be done.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But after these days having prepared ourselves,
  we were going to Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But some
  from the disciples came with us from Kesaria, having brought him with whom we
  should (lit. will) lodge, one 'Nassōn,' a Kyprian, an early disciple.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But having come into Jerusalem, the
  brethren received us in [a] joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But
  on the (lit. his) morrow Paulos came with us unto Iakōbos; but all the
  presbyters came to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And having
  saluted them, he was narrating to them one by one the things which God did
  among the Gentiles through his ministry. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But they (pron.) having heard, glorified God. But
  they said to him: 'Thou seest, our brother, how many ten thousands there are
  from the Jews who believed; and all are zealots for the law: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> but they were shown concerning thee, that thou
  teachest the Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying:
  "Circumcise not your children, nor walk according to the customs.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> What, then? They will certainly hear
  that thou camest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> This then do which
  we shall (lit. will) say to thee." We have four men who have a vow to be
  paid; <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> take these, purify thyself with
  them, and pay expense for them, that they may shave their head: and all shall
  know that the things which were said concerning thee are nothing; but that
  thou also agreest to keep the law. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  But concerning the Gentiles who believed, we (pron.) sent, having judged to
  cause them to keep. themselves from the things slain to idols, and the blood
  (plur.), and the things strangled, and the fornication.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then Paulos- took the men; on the day which
  cometh he purified himself with them; he went into the temple, manifesting
  the completion of the days of the purification, until they brought the
  offering of each one of them for each one. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But the seven days being about to be completed,
  the Jews of [the] Asia, having seen him being in the temple, troubled all the
  multitude, and they laid their hands upon him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> saying: '[The] men, [the] Israelites, help. This
  is the man who opposeth the people and the law and this place, teaching all
  in every place: but further also having brought Greeks into the temple, [and]
  he defiled the holy place.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> For they
  had before seen Trophēmos with him in the city, the Ephesian; this (man) they
  were thinking that Paulos took away into the temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But the whole city was moved, and there happened
  a running together of all the people; and having overpowered Paulos, they
  drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But as they are seeking to kill him, The news
  went up to the chiliarchos of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem was
  troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But immediately he took
  soldiers and centurions, he ran upon them. But they (pron.) having seen the
  soldiers and the chiliarchos, ceased beating Paulos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Then the chiliarchos having approached, laid hold
  on him, and he commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he was asking
  who he is, and what he did. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But
  others were crying out saying another thing. But having not been able to know
  the certainty because of the tumult, he commanded to take him away into the
  castle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But when he was mounting the
  stairs, it came to pass that the soldiers carried him because of (the)
  violence of the multitude; <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> for the
  multitude of the people were walking after him, crying out: Take him away
  there.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But as they are about to
  bring him into the castle, Paulos said to the chiliarehos: 'Is it lawful for
  me to say anything to thee?' But he (pron.) said to him: Knowest thou indeed
  Greek? <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Art thou not then the man of
  Chērni who before these days madest tumults, and thou tookest four thousand
  men of the Assassins out to (the) desert?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But Paulos said to him: 'I indeed (am) a man,
  Jew, a man of Tarsos, of [the] Kylikia, a citizen of a city which is not
  inconspicuous: I pray thee then to command me that I may speak to this
  people.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But he having commanded him,
  Paulos standing upon the stairs waved his hand against the people; but a
  great silence having been made, he cried out in the language of Hebrew,
  saying:</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles22">22</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> [The] men, [the] brethren, and
  [the] fathers, hear my defence which is mine unto you now.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But having heard that he answered them in the
  language of Hebrew, [but] they held their peace the more. And he said:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> 'I indeed am a man, Jew, I was born in
  Tarsos of [the] Kylikia, having been brought up in this city, at (the) feet
  of Gamaliēl he who taught me accurately (the) law of our fathers, I being a
  zealot for God according as all ye (pron.) also are being to-day,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> having persecuted this way even unto
  (the) death. Binding men and women, casting them to (the) prison.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> As the chief priest witnesseth to me,
  and all the presbyters: from whom having received epistle unto the brethren,
  [But] I was going to Damaskos, to bring others who were there bound into
  Jerusalem, that they might give pain to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But it happened, that as (I was) walking and
  having approached Damaskos about midday, suddenly shone upon me a great light
  from (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But I fell down,
  and I heard a voice saying to me: "Saoul, Saoul, why persecutest thou me?"
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But I (pron.) answered: "Who (art)
  thou, Lord?" But he said to me: "I am Jesus the Nazōreos, he whom thou
  (pron.) persecutest." <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But they who
  were being with me were seeing indeed the light, but they heard not (the)
  voice of him who spake to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But I
  said: "What shall (lit. will) I do, Lord?" But the Lord said to me: "Rise, go
  into Damaskos; and it will be spoken to thee there concerning all things
  which were ordained for thee to do." <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span>
  But it came to pass, that as I saw not for (the) glory of that light, they
  who were with me laid hold of my hand; I came to Damaskos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But one, called Ananias, a man devout according
  to the law, all the Jews who dwelt there witnessing to him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> [but] having come unto me, and having stood, he
  said to me: "Saoul, my brother, see." But I also in that hour gazed at him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But he (pron.) said: "God of our
  fathers chose thee before to know his will, and to see the righteous (one),
  and to hear a voice from his mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  Because thou wilt be for him witness with all men concerning the things which
  thou sawest and which thou heardest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  And now what wilt thou do? Rise, be baptised and wash thee from thy sins,
  praying to his name." <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But it came to
  pass (that) having returned to Jerusalem, and praying in the temple, I was in
  a trance; <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I saw him saying to me:
  "Come quickly from Jerusalem, because they will not receive witness from thee
  concerning me." <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> I also said: "Lord,
  they (pron.) know that I was casting to (the) prison, and I was beating in
  (every) synagogue them who believed thee: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and when they were about to shed (the) blood of
  Stephanos the martyr I also was standing, consenting, and I was keeping the
  garments of them who were killing him." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he said to me: "Go (lit. walk): because I
  (pron.) will send thee to distant Gentiles."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But they were hearing him unto this word; and
  they lifted up their voice, saying: 'Take away such an one from (the) earth:
  for he is not worthy of living.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But
  (as they are) crying out, and throwing (off) their garments, and throwing
  dust to the air, <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> the chiliarchos
  commanded them to take him into the castle, having told them to give pain to
  him with scourges, that he might know concerning what cause they cry out thus
  upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But when they strained him
  in the thongs, Paulos said to the centurion who was standing (by): 'A man,
  Roman, not even condemned, it is lawful for you to scourge him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But the centurion having heard, went unto the
  chiliarchos, he showed to him, saying: What wilt thou do? For the man is a
  Roman.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But the chiliarchos came unto
  him; he said to him: Say to me that thou (art) a Roman.' But he (pron.) said:
  Yea.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The chiliarchos answered: I
  (pron.) bought this citizenship for me with a great sum.' But Paulos said: I
  (am one) who was born in it.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span>
  Immediately then they departed from him who give pain to him: and the
  chiliarchos feared, having known that he was a Roman, and that he bound him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But on the (lit. his) morrow, wishing
  to know the certainty why the Jews accused him, he loosed him, and he
  commanded to come the chief priests and all the council, and he brought
  hullos down, he set him among them.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles23">23</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Paulos having gazed at the
  council, said, [The] men, our brethren, in all good (plur.) conscience I
  (pron.) lived before God up to this day. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But the chief priest Ananias commanded them who
  stood by him to strike on his mouth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Then said Paulos to him: God will strike thee thus, [the] wall which is
  smeared with white; thou sittest even judging me according to the law, and
  thou commandest to strike me contrary to the law.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But they who stood (by) said: 'Thou reviledst the
  chief priest of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But Paulos said:
  I was not knowing, my brethren, that he is chief priest: for it is written,
  "A ruler of thy people thou shalt not say evil against."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But Paulos having known that there is a part (of
  them) indeed belonging to the Sadducees, but the other part belonging to the
  Pharisees, he cried out in the council, [The] men, our brethren, I (am) a
  Pharisee; concerning a hope and a resurrection of the dead I (pron.) am
  judged. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But he having said this, there
  happened a tumult between the Pharisees and the Sudducees: and the multitude
  was divided. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the Sadducees indeed
  say that there is not resurrection, nor angel, 'nor spirit, but the Pharisees
  confess them both. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But a great noise
  happened, and some from the Pharisees rose, they disputed, saying: We find
  nothing of evil in this man. If a spirit spake to him or an angel.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But a great tumult having happened,
  the chiliarchos feared lest by any means Paulos should be carried (off) by
  them, he commanded the soldiery that they should go up and snatch him from
  their midst, and bring him into the castle. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But in the night which cometh the Lord stood by
  him, he said: 'Take courage; as thou witnessed concerning me in Jerusalem,
  thus thou must also witness concerning me in Rōmē.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the day having come, the Jewsassembled, they
  adjured themselves, saying (that they would) not eat nor drink until they
  killed Paulos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But they were being
  more than forty men, they who made this oath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> These came unto the chief priests and the
  presbyters, they said: an anathema we adjured ourselves not to taste anything
  until we kill Paulos: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> now then make
  known to the chiliarchos, with the council, that he may bring him unto you as
  that ye may know accurately concerning him: but we (prom) before that he
  approacheth you, are prepared to kill him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But (the) son of (the) sister of Paulos having
  heard of the plot, he came, he went in to the castle, he showed to Paulos.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But Paulos called one of the
  centurions, he said: Take this young man in unto the chiliarchos; for he hath
  a thing to say to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He (pron.)
  indeed then took him; he brought him unto the chiliarchos, and he said: The
  prisoner Paulos called me, he told me, To bring this young man in unto thee,
  having a thing to say to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But
  the chiliarchos seized hold of his hand, and having withdrawn apart alone, he
  was asking him: What (is) it which thou wishest to say to me?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But he said: The Jews settled to pray thee
  to-morrow, that thou should bring Paulos to the council, as thou wilt know
  concerning him accurately. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Thou then
  be not persuaded by them: for there are more than forty men from them lying
  in wait for him; these who adjured one another not to eat nor to drink until
  they kill him: and now they are prepared, looking out for the promise about
  to be from thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The chiliarchos
  then dismissed the young man, having ordered him not to say to any one that
  thou showedst to me these (things). <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span>
  And he called two from the centurions; he said to them: 'Prepare two hundred
  soldiers, that they may go unto Kesaria, and seventy horsemen, and two
  hundred spearmen, from (the) third hour of the night, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> and may take beasts also, that they may mount
  Paulos, and bring him safe unto Phylix the governor.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But he wrote a letter having a form thus,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Klaudios Lysia to the most excellent
  governor Phylix, hail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> This man the
  Jews seized, and as they are thinking to kill him, I went with the soldiery;
  . I saved him, having known that he is a Roman. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But wishing to know the cause concerning which
  they found fault with him, I brought him to their council: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> whom I found found fault with concerning
  questions of their law, but I found not sin in him worthy of (the) death or
  bonds for an offence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But having been
  shown concerning an evil plan which would be made against this man by them,
  immediately I sent him to thee, having ordered his accusers to speak with
  thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The soldiers indeed then,
  according to that which was ordained them, took away Paulos by night, having
  brought him to Antipatris. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But on the
  (lit. his) morrow they let the horsemen go with him; they returned to the
  castle. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But those (lit. these) having
  come to Kesaria, and having given the epistle to the governor, they presented
  Paulos also to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But he having
  read the letter, asked from what province he is; and having known that he is
  from [the] Kylikia, <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> I shall hear
  thee, he said, whenever should come thine accusers: and he commanded to keep
  him in the pretōrion of Ērōdēs.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles24">24</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But after five days came up the
  chief priest Ananias with presbyters, and also an orator, called Tertyllos:
  these having come, made known to the governor against Paulos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But he having been called, Tertyllos began to
  accuse him, saying, Abundant peace happens through thee, and establishment
  (plur.) is happening to this nation through thy providence <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> on all sides, and in all places, we accept thee,
  most excellent Phylix, in all thanksgiving. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But that I may not hinder thee the more, I pray
  thee to hear me concisely in thy fairness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For we found this pestilent man, moving troubles
  to all the Jews who are in the world, being (a) first (man) for (the) sect of
  the Nazōreos: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> who tried to defile the
  temple even: and we laid hold on him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Omitted <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> This (man) from whom it is
  possible for thee thyself to know, shouldest thou examine him concerning
  these things in which we accuse him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  The Jews added their word that these things were thus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Paulos answered, the governor having beckoned to
  him to speak, Knowing thee since many years being judge to this nation, I
  shall (lit. will) answer in delight of heart for myself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> It being possible for thee to know, that not more
  than twelve days have passed since I went into Jerusalem to worship;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Neither found they me in the temple
  speaking to (any) one, nor troubling a multitude, nor in the synagogues, nor
  in city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Nor is it possible for them
  to establish these (things), these of which they accuse me now. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But I confess this to thee, that according to
  this way which these say that (it is a) sect, I worship thus (the) God of my
  fathers, believing all the things which are written in the law and the
  prophets: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Having a hope toward God,
  which these also look out for, the resurrection about to be for the just and
  the wrongdoers. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> In this I shall (lit.
  will) exercise (myself) also for there to be to me a conscience offenceless
  before God and before [the] men always. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But after (lit. from) many years I came to do
  alms to my nation, and offerings: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  these in which they found me purified in the temple, not with a multitude nor
  with a tumult: <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> but certain Jews from
  [the] Asia, they (lit. these) who ought to have come before thee and accuse,
  If they have a thing against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Otherwise let these themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me, standing
  in the council, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> (other) than
  concerning this one saying, this which I cried out among them standing,
  Concerning (the) resurrection of the dead. I (pron.) am judged to-day before
  you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Phylix put them off,
  knowing accurately concerning them of the way, having said: 'If Lysias the
  chiliarchos should come up, I shall know concerning you.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he (part.) commanded the centurion who kept
  him, [but] to give indulgence to him, and not to hinder any of his friends
  from ministering to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But after
  some days Phylix came with Drousilla his wife being a Jewess; he sent for
  Paulos, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> speaking to him concerning [the] righteousness,
  and [the] temperance, and the judgement which will be: but Phylix having been
  in [a] fear answered: Go away, now; but should I have (lit, take) a time, I
  shall (lit. will) send for thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But
  withal he was hoping that Paulos will give money (plug.) to him; and thus
  that he might release him. Therefore he was sending for him many times,
  speaking to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But two years having
  been completed, Phylix received a successor, Porkios Phēstos; but Phylix,
  wishing to give a favour to the Jews, left Paulos bound.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles25">25</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Phēstos then having come to the
  province, after three days went into Jerusalem from Kesaria. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> The chief priests and the first (men) of the Jews
  made known to him concerning Paulos, and they were beseeching him,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> asking a favour against him, that he
  might send for him to bring him into Jerusalem; laying wait to kill him on
  the way. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Phestos then answered, that
  Paulos is kept in Kesaria, but he (pron.) is thinking to go thither quickly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They then, he said, for whom it is
  possible among you, let them come down with me; if there is an evil thing in
  this man, let them accuse him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  having been among them not more than eight days or ten, he came to Kesaria.
  But on the (lit. his) morrow he sat on the judgement seat, he commanded to
  bring Paulos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But he having come, the
  Jews stood against him, having come down from Jerusalem, bringing many heavy
  charges upon him, these which they could not establish, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Paulos defending himself: 'Neither sinned I
  against (the) law of the Jews, nor the temple, nor (the) king.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But Phēstos, wishing to be gracious to the Jews,
  answered; he said to Paulos: Wishest thou to go to Jerusalem to be judged
  there with them concerning these (things)?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But Paulos said: I stand at the judgement seat of
  (the) king, the place in which I ought to be judged: but to the Jews I did
  not any wrong, as thou also knowest perfectly. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> If then I do wrong, and if I did any work worthy
  of (the) death, then I refuse not to die. But if there is not anything in the
  things which these accuse me, it is not possible for any to grant me to them,
  I appeal to (the) king.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then Phēstos
  spake to the council; he answered, Thou appealedst to (the) king, thou shalt
  go unto (the) king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But some days
  having passed, Agrippas (the) king and Bernike came to stay at Kesaria; they
  saluted Phēstos. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But having spent
  many days there, Phēstos laid (the) Matthewter of Paulos before (the) king,
  saying: There is a man bound, having been left by Phylix: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> but I having gone into Jerusalem, the chief
  priests and the presbyters of the Jews spoke openly (of him), asking against
  him a sentence. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But I responded to
  them, saying that it is not a custom of the Romans to give up a man, before
  that the accusers stand before him whom they accuse, and he find place of
  giving his defence concerning the fault. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> They having come then with me to this place, I
  made not any delay; but on the (lit. his) morrow I sat on the judgement seat,
  I commanded to bring the man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And
  this (man), the accusers having stood against him, were bringing no pretexts
  among those of which I (pron.) think that they are evil; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> questions then they had between them and him
  concerning a doctrine of demons of theirs, and concerning one, called Jesus,
  who died, this (man) whom Paulos was saying that he is alive. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But I (pron.) was being amazed concerning these
  questions of these (things); I was saying: Wilt thou go to Jerusalem, and be
  judged there concerning these (things)? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Paulos having appealed to (the) king I kept him
  for (the) knowledge of (the) king, I commanded to keep him until I send him
  to (the) king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But Agrippas said to
  Phēstos: I was wishing also to hear the man.' [For] tomorrow, he said, thou
  shalt hear him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> On the (lit. his)
  morrow then, Agrippa having come and Bernikē, with a great pomp, and they
  having gone into the place of audience, with chiliarchs and great men of the
  city, and Phestos having commanded, they brought Paul. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Phestos said: '(The) king Agrippa and all the
  men who are with us, ye see this (man): concerning him all the multitude of
  the Jews pleaded with me in Jerusalem and in this place also, crying out that
  he is not worthy to live any longer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  But I (pron.) knew him, that he did not anything worthy of (the) death: but
  he himself having appealed to (the) king, I decided to send him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Concerning whom there is not that which I shall
  (lit. will) write of certainty to my lord (the) king, Therefore I brought him
  before you, and especially before thee, (the) king Agrippa, that thou having
  enquired of him, I might find that which I shall (lit. will) write.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For I think that it is a thing
  unreasonable to send the prisoner (and) not to signify his charges also which
  concern him.'</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles26">26</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Agrippas said to Paulos: Thou
  art commanded to speak for thyself.' Then Paulos stretched out his hand, he
  made defence <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> concerning all things
  with which the Jews find fault with him to (the) king Agrippa, I think that I
  (am) happy, being about to make defence to-day before thee: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> especially as thou knowest the customs of the Jews
  and their questions: therefore I pray thee to hear me longsufferingly.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> My living from my youth, which was
  from (the) beginning among my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> knowing me before from (this time)
  upward, should they wish to witness, That according to the sect which is
  strict of our service I lived as Pharisee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And now concerning (the) hope of the promise which
  was made to our fathers by God I stand being judged, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> that is to say this hope (as to) which the twelve
  tribes were serving continually in the day and the night, wishing to attain
  unto it. Concerning this hope, (the) king, the Jews find fault with me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Why is it incredible, judge in
  yourselves, if God will raise the dead? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I indeed then was thinking for myself to do many
  things which oppose (the) name of Jesus the Nazōreos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> This which I did in Jerusalem; many among the
  saints I (pron.) cast into the prisons, having received the authority from
  the chief priests; (as) they were killing them I gave vote against them
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> in every synagogue; giving pain to
  them many times, I was forcing them to blaspheme; but in [an] excess being in
  a madness towards them, I persecuted them even unto the cities also which are
  outside. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And in these (things)
  journeying to Damaskos with an authority and commandment of the chief
  priests, <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> [but] being on the road at
  midday I saw, (the) king, a light from (the) heaven brighter than (the) sun,
  it came upon me and them who were with me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But we all having fallen upon the earth, I heard
  a voice saying to me in the language of Hebrew: Saoul, Saoul, why persecutest
  thou me? It is a hard thing for thee to kick against goads.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But I (pron.) said: Who (art) thou, Lord?' But
  the Lord said to me: I am Jesus, whom thou (pron.) persccutest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But rise, stand upon thy feet. For therefore I
  manifested myself to thee, to choose thee as an officer for me, and that thou
  mayest witness to the things which thou sawest, those in which I shall (lit.
  will) manifest myself to thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> I
  shall save thee from the people and from the Gentiles, those to whom I
  (pron.) shall (lit. will) send thee, <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span>
  to open their eyes, to cause them to return from (the) darkness into (the)
  light, and from (the) authority of Satan to God, to cause them to receive
  (the) forgiveness of their sins, and an inheritance among them who are
  sanctified in the faith of me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Therefore, (the) king Agrippa, I could not be disobedient to the vision of
  (the) heaven: <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> but to them who were in
  Damaskos first and Jerusalem, and all (the) country of [the] Ioudea, and the
  Gentiles, I proclaimed to cause them to repent and to cause them to return to
  God, to do works worthy of the repentance. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Therefore the Jews laid hold on one in the
  temple, they were trying to lay (lit. bring) their hand upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But having received a help from God, I stood
  until to-day, witnessing to [a] small and [a] great, not saying anything
  except those which the prophets say and Mōysēs, that they will happen:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If Christ is a sufferer, if he is
  first from (the) resurrection of the dead, he will proclaim a light to the
  people and the Gentiles. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> As he is
  saying these (things), Phēstos said in a great voice: Thou wast mad, O Paul,
  the much learning (lit. of writing) caused thee to be mad.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But Paulos said: I am not mad, most excellent
  Phestos; but words of [the] truth and [the] piety (are) those which I say.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For the king also knoweth concerning
  these things, to whom I am bold (in) speaking; for I am persuaded that none
  of these (things) escape his notice; for this was not done in a corner.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Thou believest, (the) king Agrippas,
  the prophets; I know that thou believest.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But Agrippas said to Paulos: '(With) even a
  little thou wilt persuade me to make myself Chrēstianos.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But Paulos said: I pray to God both in [a] little
  and (next) in [a] great, not only thou, but also all who hear me to-day for
  them to become in my manner, in the manner in which I also am, save my
  bonds.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But (the) king rose, and the
  governor and Bernikē and they who sat with them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> and having withdrawn, they were speaking to one
  another, saying: This man doeth not any deed worthy of (the) death or bonds.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> But Agrippas said to Phēstos: It was
  possible to release this man, if he had not appealed to (the) king.'</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles27">27</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But it came to pass (that), it
  having been decided for us to sail to [the] Hytalia, he delivered Paulos and
  other prisoners to a centurion, his name being Ioulios, from the band of
  Sabastē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> But we went on board a ship
  Andramantinean, about to sail to the places of [the] Asia, we put to sea,
  being with us Aristarchos also of (the) Makedonia, the native of
  Thessalonikē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But on the (lit. his)
  morrow we came to (the) Sydōn. But Ioulios did [a] kindness with Paulos; he
  commanded him to go unto his friends, that they might take care of him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And having put to sea from there, we
  sailed along Kypros, because that the wind was opposing us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But having sailed away to the sea which is between
  Kypros and [the] Pamphylia, we came to Lystra of [the] Kylikia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the centurim found a ship there of Rakoti,
  about to sail to [the] Hytalia; he placed us on it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But having delayed in sailing many days, and
  having scarcely come off Chnidos, the wind not letting us, [but] we sailed
  along [the] Krētē off Salmonē; <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> having
  scarcely left it, we came to a place called the good harbours'; [but] a city
  called Lasea was being near to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  But great time having passed, and already it was no longer (the) time of
  sailing, for the ship had gone out of her course, because that the fast also
  had passed. But Paulos was exhorting, <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  saying to them, [The] men, I see that an injury and much loss will happen,
  not only of the ship and the freight, but also our lives, in this voyage.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But the centurion was trusting to the
  steersman and the shipowner rather than the things which Paulos was saying.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> But the harbour not being (well)
  placed for us to winter in, most of them made a plan to put out from there,
  that perhaps they could reach Phoinix to winter in, harbour of [the] Krētē,
  looking westward, being a place of Chōra. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But a south wind blowing, they were thinking that
  they will be able to establish their purpose a, they put to sea from Asses,
  they left [the] Krētē. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But a high
  wind, which is called 'Eurakylōn,' delayed not, it blew against us.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But it having carried off the ship,
  as they could not oppose the wind, we gave up, we were driven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But having fled to an island which is called
  Klauda,' scarcely could we secure the boat: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> this having been taken away, they were making
  help, girding the ship; but fearing lest by any means they should fall into
  the Sirtēs, we lowered the gear, and thus we floated along. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But as a tossing was rocking us exceedingly,
  [but] on the (lit. his) morrow they were tossing out (the freight):
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and on the third day they put (lit.
  cast) their hand on the gear (plur.) of the ship, they threw them out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But as appear not (the) sun and the
  stars for many days, no small tempest being that which was happening, at
  length all our hope for us to be saved had gone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But a long (time of) not eating happens. Then
  stood Paulos in their midst, he said: Ye ought indeed, O [the] men having
  obeyed me, not to have put to sea from [the] Krētē and gain this injury and
  this loss. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And now again I entreat
  you, be longsuffering, for one life from you will not be lost except only the
  ship. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> For stood by me in this night
  an angel of God, whose I am, and I worship him, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> saying: "Fear not, O Paulos, thou must be set
  before (the) king: and lo, all they who sail with thee I granted them to
  thee." <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Therefore, [the] men, be glad
  of heart, for I believe God, that it (lit. they) will be as it was spoken to
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For we must come upon an island.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But fourteen nights having passed, we
  are rolling among the waves in the Andrias.' But at midnight [but] the
  sailors were thinking that they approached a country: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> and having thrown down the sounding line, they
  found twenty fathoms of water. But having done a short distance, they threw
  the sounding line down, they found fifteen fathoms. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> But fearing lest by any means we should fall on
  reefs, they cast four anchors at the stern of the ship, they were praying for
  it to be the day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But the sailors,
  seeking that they might flee from the ship, let down the boat to the sea in
  pretence as that they are going to cast anchors from the fore(ship).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Paulos said to the centurion and the
  soldiers, Unless these stay on the ship it is not possible for you to be
  saved. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Then the soldiers broke away
  the ropes of the boat, they let her fall. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Until the day came, Paulos was persuading them
  all that they should take some food, saying: Lo, fourteen days ye completed,
  looking out, ye ate not anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  Therefore I pray you to take your food: for this is (the) first (thing) unto
  your health; for a hair of (the) head of one of you will not perish.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> But having said these (things), he
  took a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it, he began
  to eat. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But the heart of all of them
  having been glad, they also took their food. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But all the souls who were being in the ship were
  making two hundred (and) seventy-six. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  But having been satisfied with the food, they were causing the ship to
  lighten, throwing the wheat to the sea. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But when the day came, they knew not the land;
  but they were observing a bay, having (lit. being) a shore in it: but they
  were considering that perhaps they would be able to save the ship thither.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And having lifted the anchors, they
  were letting them (go) in the sea, but at the same time they loosed the heads
  of the rudders; and having hoisted the foresail to the wind which blew, they
  put in to the shore. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> But having
  fallen on a place, being of two seas, they ran the ship aground thither; and
  the fore(part) of it indeed was fixed, it stayed, not moving, but the hinder
  (part) of it was destroyed by (the) violence of the waves. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But the soldiers made a plan, that they should
  kill the prisoners, lest by any means one should swim and flee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> But the centurion, wishing to save Paulos,
  hiddered them from doing their plan: But he commanded those for whom it was
  possible that they should support themselves on the sea, and swim first to
  the shore: <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and the rest also, some
  indeed on boards, but others on pieces also of the ship. And thus it happened
  for us all to come safe to the shore.</p>

  <h3 id="acts_of_the_apostles28">28</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And having been saved, then we knew
  that that island is called Melitinē.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span>
  But the barbarians of that place were doing a kindness with us not a little:
  for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the rain which
  was happening, and because of the cold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But Paulos turned himself, he found a quantity of
  rubbish, and he threw it (plur.) to the fire, and from the heat came out a
  viper, it bit his hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But the
  barbarians having seen the wild beast hanging to his hand, they weresaying to
  one another: Certainly this man is a murderer, this (one) whom, after having
  been saved from the sea, his judgement letteth him not live.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He (pron.) indeed then, shook the wild beast to
  the fire, no evil happened to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But
  they (pron.) were thinking that he will swell or will fall immediately and
  die: but having waited, gazing at him, and having seen that no evil thing
  seized him, they turned themselves immediately, saying that he was a god.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But in that place there were many
  fields of the first (man) of the island, his name being Pouplios: this (man)
  having taken us up, received us in a love of hospitality three days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But it came to pass (that) the father
  of Pouplios having been sick in fevers and dysenteries was prostrate under
  them. But this (man)--Paulos went in unto him, he prayed, he laid his hands
  upon him, he healed him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But this
  having been done, (the) rest who were in the island, with whom there was
  sickness, were coming unto him and he was healing them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But these honoured us in great honour, and when
  we were about to be brought from there, they prepared for us that of which we
  had need. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But after three months we
  came in a ship of Rakoti, being on it a sign of Dioskoros, which wintered in
  the island. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And we put in at
  Sirakousas, we abode there three days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And having come from there we reached Rēgion: and
  after a day a south wind was strong with us, we came the second day to
  Pontiolous; <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and having found the
  brethren there, they persuaded us to abide with them seven days: and thus we
  came to Rome. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> But the brethren who
  (were) there having heard concerning us, came to meet us even unto
  Appiophorou, and Three Tabernōn: but Paulos having seen them, gave thanks to
  God, and took courage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> But when we
  went into Rōmē, he commanded Paulos to abide alone with the soldier who kept
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> But it came to pass after three
  days (that) he called the first (men) of the Jews who were there: but they
  having come thither, he was saying to them, I, [the] men, our brethren, did
  not anything in opposition to the people or the customs of our fathers, I was
  bound, from Jerusalem I was delivered to (the) hands of the Romans:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> these having examined (me), were
  wishing to release me, because they found not any cause of (the) death being
  in me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> But, the Jews making
  objection, it was necessary for me to appeal to (the) king, not as that there
  is anything of accusation to make against my nation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Because of this reason, then, I was praying to
  see you, and to speak to you: for concerning (the) hope of Israel I am bound
  by this chain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But they (pron.) said
  to him: 'To us (pron.) neither came writing from [the] Ioudea, nor came one
  from the brethren and showed to us or said an evil word against thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But we think right to bear from thee
  the things which thou thinkest: for concerning this sect the thing is
  manifest to us, that objection is made concerning it in every place.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But they appointed to him a day, they
  came unto him to the lodging, being many: and he declared to them, witnessing
  to them concerning the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, from
  (the) law of Mōysēs and the prophets, from early unto evening. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And some indeed were being persuaded by the
  things which he was saying; but others were being unbelieving. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But disagreeing amongst themselves, Paulos
  dismissed them, saying one word to them: 'Well spake the holy spirit through
  Ēsaēas the prophet to your fathers, <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  saying: "Go unto this people, say to them: In a hearing ye shall hear, and ye
  shall not understand; in a seeing ye shall see, and ye shall not see.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For (the) heart of this people
  thickened, and they were heavy for (the) hearing in their ears, and they shut
  their eyes, lest by any means they might see with their eyes, and hear in
  their ears, and understand in their heart, and return, and I heal them."
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Let the thing be manifest to you,
  that God sent his saviour among the Gentiles, they (pron.) also (are they)
  who will hear.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Omitted <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> But he abode two whole years in the place which
  he took for his own hired house, and he was receiving all who come in unto
  him, <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> proclaiming the kingdom of God,
  and teaching all in boldness concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, and there was
  not any hindering him.</p>
