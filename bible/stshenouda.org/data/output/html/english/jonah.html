  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now the word of the Lord came to
  Jonas the son of Amathi, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Rise,
  and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of its
  wickedness is come up to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> But Jonas
  rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to
  Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid his fare, and went up
  into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord raised up a wind on the
  sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of
  being broken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the sailors were
  alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in
  the ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone
  down into the hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him,
  Why snorest thou? arise, and call upon thy God, that God may save us, and we
  perish not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And each man said to his
  neighbour, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake this mischief
  is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And they said to him, Tell us what is thine
  occupation, and whence comest thou, and of what country and what people art
  thou? <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said to them, I am a
  servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea,
  and the dry land. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then the men feared
  exceedingly, and said to him, What is this that thou hast done? for the men
  knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And they said to him, What shall we
  do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea rose, and lifted its
  wave exceedingly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And Jonas said to
  them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you:
  for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the men tried hard to return to the land, and
  were not able: for the sea rose and grew more and more tempestuous against
  them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And they cried to the Lord, and
  said, Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this man’s life, and
  bring not righteous blood upon us: for thou, Lord, hast done as thou
  wouldest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> So they took Jonas, and
  cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And the men feared the Lord very greatly, and
  offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows.</p>

  <h3 id="jonah2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now the Lord had commanded a great
  whale to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days
  and three nights. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Jonas prayed to
  the Lord his God out of the belly of the whale, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my
  God, and he hearkened to me, even to my cry out of the belly of hell: thou
  heardest my voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Thou didst cast me
  into the depths of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: all thy
  billows and thy waves have passed upon me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I said, I am cast out of thy presence: shall I
  indeed look again toward thy holy temple? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Water was poured around me to the soul: the lowest
  deep compassed me, my head went down <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  to the clefts of the mountains; I went down into the earth, whose bars are
  the everlasting barriers: yet, O Lord my God, let my ruined life be restored.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> When my soul was failing me, I
  remembered the Lord; and may my prayer come to thee into thy holy temple.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> They that observe vanities and lies
  have forsaken their own mercy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But I
  will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: all that I
  have vowed I will pay to thee, the Lord of my salvation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And the whale was commanded by the Lord, and it
  cast up Jonas on the dry land.</p>

  <h3 id="jonah3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And the word of the Lord came to
  Jonas the second time, saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Rise,
  go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it according to the former
  preaching which I spoke to thee of. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And Jonas arose, and went to Nineve, as the Lord had spoken. Now Nineve was
  an exceeding great city, of about three days’ journey. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jonas began to enter into the city about a day’
   s journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve shall be
  overthrown. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the men of Nineve
  believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest
  of them to the least of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the
  word reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took
  off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And proclamation was made, and it was
  commanded in Nineve by the king an by his great men, saying, Let not men, or
  cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste any thing, nor feed, nor drink water.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> So men and cattle were clothed with
  sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their
  evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his
  fierce anger, and so we shall not perish? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And God saw their works, that they turned from
  their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do
  to them; and he did it not.</p>

  <h3 id="jonah4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> But Jonas was very deeply grieved,
  and he was confounded. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he prayed
  to the Lord, and said, O Lord, were not these my words when I was yet in my
  land? therefore I made haste to flee to Tharsis; because I knew that thou are
  merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and
  repentest of evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And now, Lord God,
  take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Lord said to Jonas, Art thou
  very much grieved? <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And Jonas went out
  from the city, and sat over against the city; and he made for himself there a
  booth, and he sat under it, until he should perceive what would become of the
  city. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And the Lord God commanded a
  gourd, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head,
  to shade him from his calamities: and Jonas rejoiced with great joy for the
  gourd. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And God commanded a worm the
  next morning, and it smote the gourd, and it withered away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And it came to pass at the rising of the sun, that
  God commanded a burning east wind; and the sun smote on the head of Jonas,
  and he fainted, and despaired of his life, and said, It is better for me to
  die than to live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And God said to
  Jonas, Art thou very much grieved for the gourd? And he said, I am very much
  grieved, even to death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the Lord
  said, Thou hadst pity on the gourd, for which thou has not suffered, neither
  didst thou rear it; which came up before night, and perished before another
  night: <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and shall not I spare Nineve,
  the great city, in which dwell more than twelve myriads of human beings, who
  do not know their right hand or their left hand; and also much cattle?</p>
