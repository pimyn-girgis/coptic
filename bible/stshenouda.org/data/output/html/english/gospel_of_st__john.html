  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In (the) beginning was the Word,
  and the Word was (imperf.) with God, and God (indef. art.) was the Word:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> this (one) [who?] was (imperf.) from
  beginning with God: <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> all things became
  through him; and without him did not anything become of (lit. in) that which
  became: <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> (the) life was that [which] is
  in him. And (the) life was (the) light of [the] men: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> and the light gave light in the darkness, and the
  darkness did not apprehend it (lit. him). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> There was (lit. became) a man sent from (lit.
  through) God, his name being John: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  this (one) came for a witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that
  all might believe through him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He was
  not the light, but (came) that he might bear witness of the light.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> There was becoming the true
  light--that which giveth light to every man who cometh to the world.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> He was being in the world, and the
  world became through him, and the world did not know him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> He came to them who were his own, and they who
  were his own received him not to them: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> but they who received him to them--he gave
  authority to them to become (lit. do) sons of God (without the usual weak
  article)--them who believe his name. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  And they were not of blood, nor were they of (the) wish of flesh, nor were
  they of (the) wish of man, but they were born of God (weak definite article).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And the word became (lit. did) flesh
  (indef. art.), and abode (lit. became) among us, and we saw his glory, as
  (the) glory of an only Son of his Father, full of grace and truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> John beareth witness concerning him,
  and crieth out, saying: This (is) he, concerning whom I said, that he who
  cometh after me had precedence of me, because he was prior to me indeed.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Because we all received from his
  fulness, and grace in exchange for grace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Because the law was given through Moses, but the
  grace and the truth became through Jesus Christ. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> God no one ever saw: the only-begotten God
  (without article), who is in the bosom of his Father, he spake. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And this is the witness of John, when the Jews
  sent to him from Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might ask him: Who
  (art) thou? <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he confessed, he
  denied not, and he confessed: I am not Christ.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And they asked him: Art thou Elias?' he said:
  'Nay." Art thou the prophet?' he answered: 'Nay.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> They said then to him: 'Who (art) thou? that we
  may give answer (lit. find (the) question) to them who sent us: what sayest
  thou concerning thyself? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He said: I
  am the voice which crieth out in (the) desert: "Make straight the road of the
  Lord, as said Esaias the prophet."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  And they had been sent from the Pharisees: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and they asked him, saying to him: Wherefore
  baptisest thou, if thou art not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> John answered them, saying: 'I
  baptise you in water: there standeth in your midst he whom ye know not:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> he who cometh after me: he of whom I
  am not worthy that I may unloose a latchet of his shoe.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> These (things) happened in Bêthania beyond the
  Jordan, the place in which John was baptising. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And on the (lit. his) morrow he saw Jesus coming
  to him, and he said: 'Lo, the Lamb of God who will take away (the) sin of the
  world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> This is he concerning whom I
  said, that there cometh after me a man who hath precedence of me, because he
  is prior to me indeed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And I was
  knowing him not; but that he might appear to Israel, therefore I came to
  baptise in water.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And John bare
  witness, saying: I saw the Spirit coming down upon him as a dove from (the)
  heaven; he stayed upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And I was
  knowing him not; but he who sent me to baptise in water, he said to me: "He
  upon whom thou seest the Spirit coming down and staying upon him, this is he
  who will baptise in (the, lit. a) Holy Spirit." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And I saw, and bare witness, that this is (the)
  Son of God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And on the (lit. his)
  morrow again John was standing, and two of his disciples; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> and having looked at Jesus walking, he said: 'Lo,
  the Lamb of God!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the two
  disciples of his heard him speaking, and they walked after Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Jesus having turned himself, and
  having seen them walking after him, said to them: 'For what sought ye?' And
  they said to him: 'Rabbi,' which they interpret, Teacher, 'where art thou
  abiding?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he said to them: Come
  and see: ' they came then and saw where he is abiding; and they abode with
  him that day: and it was (the) tenth hour. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one
  of the two who heard from John, and walked after him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And this (man) found first his brother Simon, and
  said to him: 'We found Mesias: whose interpretation is Christ.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> This (man) brought him to Jesus: and Jesus having
  looked at him, said to him: Thou art Simon (the) son of John: thou shalt be
  called "Kepha,"' which they interpret Peter.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And on the (lit. his) morrow he wished to come to
  Galilee; and he found Philip. and said to him: Walk after me:' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> and Philip was a man of Bêthsaida, from (the)
  city of Andrew and Peter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And Philip
  found Nathanael, and said to him: Him, concerning whom Moses wrote in the law
  and the prophets, we found; it (lit. who) is Jesus (the) son of Joseph, the
  (man) from Nazareth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> And Nathanael
  said to him: 'Is it possible that [a] good may be from Nazareth?' Philip said
  to him: 'Come and see.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And Jesus saw
  Nathanael coming to him, and said concerning him: Behold, truly [lo], an
  Israelite; there is not guile in him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Nathanael said to him: Where knewest thou me?'
  Jesus answered and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, thou being
  under the fig-tree, I saw thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span>
  Nathanael answered him, he said to him: Rabbi, thou art (the) Son of God,
  thou art (the) King of Israel.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> Jesus
  answered, he said to him: 'Because I said to thee, that I saw thee under the
  fig-tree, believest thou? greater (things) than these thou shalt see.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> And he said: Verily, verily, I say to
  you, that ye shall see (the) heaven opened, and the angels of God going up
  and coming down towards (the) Son of (the) man.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john2">2</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And on the third day there was a
  marriage in (the) Cana of Galilee; and (the) mother of Jesus was there:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and Jesus also and his disciples were
  invited to the marriage. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the wine
  having failed, (the) mother of Jesus said to him: They have not wine.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus said to her: What (bast)
  thou with me, thou Woman? mine hour cometh not yet.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And his mother said to the servants (lit. deacons,
  also ver. 9): That which he will say to you, do.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now were (imperf.) set there six stone waterpots,
  according to (the) cleansing of the Jews, holding two or three firkins
  apiece. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Jesus said to them: Fill the
  waterpots with water:' and they filled them up to the brim. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> He said to them: 'Draw out now, and bring to the
  ruler-of-the-feast:' and they brought. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And when the ruler-of-the-feast tasted the water made wine, and was not
  knowing whence it is; but the servants were knowing, they who filled the
  water. Then the ruler-of-the-feast called the bridegroom, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> he said to him: 'All men set the good wine first,
  and if they should drink freely, they bring that which is worse: but thou
  kept the good wine until now.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> This
  is the first sign which Jesus did in (the) Cana of Galilee, and manifested
  his glory; and his disciples believed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> After this he came into Kapharnaûm, he and his
  mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and he stayed there not many
  days: <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and (the) feast of theo Jews
  was approaching, and Jesus came up to Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he found in the temple them who sold oxen and
  sheep and doves, and the changers sitting. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And he made a scourge of cords, he cast them all
  out of the temple, the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the change of
  the changers, and overturned their tables: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> and he said to them who sold doves: 'Take away
  these from here (lit. this): make not (the) house of my Father a house of
  merchandise.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> His disciples
  remembered that it is written: (The) zeal of thy house will eat me.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Jews answered, they said to him:
  What sign wilt thou show to us, because thou doest these (things)?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Jesus answered, he said to them: Pull
  down this temple, and I will make it stand in three days.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> The Jews said: They spent (lit. did) forty-six
  years building this temple, and wilt thou make it stand in three days?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he was speaking concerning the
  temple of his body. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> When, then, he
  rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he was saying this, and
  they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus said. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Now he being in Jerusalem in (the) feast of the
  passover, many believed his name, seeing the signs which he was doing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But Jesus was not trusting himself to
  them, because that he was knowing all (men); <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> and had not (imperf.) need that any one should
  bear witness to him about [a] man; for he was knowing what is in [the]
  men.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john3">3</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now there was a man of the
  Pharisees, his name being Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> This (man) came to Jesus by night, and said to
  him: Rabbi, we know that thou camest from God, as a teacher: for it is not
  possible for any one to do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jesus answered, he said to
  him: Verily, verily, I say to thee, that unless a man be born another time,
  it is not possible for him to see the kingdom of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Nicodemus said to him: How is it possible that a
  man should be born another time after his being old? Is it possible for him
  to go into (the) womb of his mother (the) second time and be born?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Jesus answered and said: Verily,
  verily, I say to thee, that unless any one be born of [a] water and the (lit.
  a) Spirit, it is not possible for him to come into the kingdom of God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> That which is born (lit. the birth) of
  (the) flesh is flesh: that which is born (lit. the birth) of the Spirit is
  spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Wonder not because I said to
  thee, that ye must be born another time. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The wind (lit. spirit) bloweth whither it (lit.
  he, masc. again) willeth, and thou hearest its voice, but thou knowest not
  from where it is coining, and to where it (is) going: this is as every one
  who is born of the Spirit.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Nicodemus
  answered and said to him: How is it possible that these (things) should be?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Jesus answered and said to him: 'Thou
  art (the) scribe of Israel, and thou knowest not these (things)? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Verily, verily, I say to thee, that we speak that
  which we know, and we bear witness to that which we see, and our witness ye
  receive not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> If I said things of
  (the) earth to you, (and) ye believed not, how, if I should say things of
  (the) heaven to you, believe ye? <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And
  no one went up to (the) heaven except him who came down from (the) heaven,
  who is (the) Son of (the) man, he who is in (the) heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in (the)
  desert, thus must (the) Son of (the) man be lifted up: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> that every one who believeth him (so throughout)
  may receive the eternal life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> For
  thus God loved the world, so that he gave his only Son, that every one who
  believeth him might not perish, but receive eternal life. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For God sent not his Son to the world, that he
  might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He who believeth him will not be
  judged: but he who believeth not him hath been judged, because he believed
  not (the) name of the only begotten Son of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> This is the judgement, that the light came to the
  world, and [the] men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their
  works were (imperf.) evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For every
  one who doeth the evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that
  his works may not be convicted, that they are evil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light,
  that his works may appear, that he did them in God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And after these (things) Jesus came and his
  disciples to (the) land of Judea; and he was (imperf.) there with them
  baptising. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And John also was
  baptising in Enôn by Salim, because there was much water there: and they were
  coining, and were being baptised. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> For
  John was not yet cast into (the) prison. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> A questioning then happened among (lit. from) the
  disciples of John with the Jews concerning cleansing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And they came to John, they said to him: Rabbi,
  he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, he of whom thou bearest witness,
  behold this (man) baptiseth, and all come to him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> John answered and said: It is not possible that a
  man should receive anything of himself, unless it was given him from (the)
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Ye bear witness to me, that I
  said to you, that I am not Christ, but that I was sent before that (one).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> He who hath the bride he is the
  bridegroom: but (the) friend of the bridegroom is he who standeth, and,
  hearing him with joy, rejoiceth because of (the) voice of the bridegroom.
  This then is my own joy, it was fulfilled. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> That (one) then must grow (greater), but I must
  be humiliated. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> He who cometh from
  above is above all: the (one) of (the) earth is of (the) earth, and speaketh
  of (the) earth. He who cometh from (the) heaven is above all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> That which he saw and which he heard, to this he
  beareth witness, and his witness no one receiveth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> He who will receive his witness, [this] sealed,
  that God is true. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> For he whom God
  sent, (is he) who speaketh the words of God: for God was not giving the
  Spirit in measure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> The Father loveth
  (the) Son, and gave all things into his hands. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> He who believeth the Son hath eternal life. But
  he who is disobedient to the Son shall not see (the) life, but (the) anger of
  God shall abide upon him.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john4">4</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> When then Jesus knew that the
  Pharisees heard that Jesus made him many disciples and baptiseth (more) than
  John, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> although Jesus himself was not
  baptising, but it was his disciples, <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  he left Judea, and went again to Galilee: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and it was necessary for him to pass through (the)
  Samaria. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> He came then to a city of
  (the) Samaria called 'Sychar,' being near to the field which Jacob gave to
  Joseph his son. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And a fountain of
  water of Jacob was (imperf.) there. Jesus then having been wearied from the
  road of walking, sat thus at (lit. upon) the fountain; it was the sixth hour.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> A woman then came from (the) Samaria
  to fill water: Jesus said to her: Give to me that I may drink.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And his disciples had gone to the city that they
  might buy victuals for them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> The
  Samaritan woman said to him: How dost thou, a Jew, ask from me to drink, I
  (being) a Samaritan woman?' for the Jews mingle not with the Samaritans.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Jesus answered and said to her: `If
  thou knewest (imperf.) the gift of God, and who saith to thee: "Give to me
  that I may drink," thou wouldest ask him, and he would give to thee living
  water.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The woman said to him: Lord,
  thou hast not even a thing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then
  (art) thou having the living water? <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave to us this well, and he
  himself drank of it, and his sons, and his cattle?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Jesus answered, he said to her: Every one who
  will drink of the water, that which I will give to him, shall never thirst.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> But the water, which I will give to
  him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The woman said to him: My Lord, give
  to me this water, that I may not thirst any more, nor come here to fill
  water.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Jesus said to her: Go, call
  thy husband, and come here.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The
  woman answered and said: I have not husband.' Jesus said to her: Well saidst
  thou, that I have not husband: <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> for
  thou tookest five husbands; and he who is with thee now is not thy husband;
  this is true which thou saidst.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The
  woman said to him: My Lord, I see that thou (art) a prophet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Our fathers worshipped upon this mountain; but ye
  say, that the place of worship in Jerusalem is the place in which it is
  lawful to worship.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Jesus said to
  her: Woman, trust me, that an hour cometh, when neither upon this mountain
  nor in Jerusalem will they (be) worshipping the Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Ye worship that which ye know not: and we worship
  that which we know, because the salvation (is) of the Jews. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> But an hour cometh, which now is, when the true
  worshippers will (be) worshipping the Father in spirit and truth: for the
  Father sought for such (to be) them who worship him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> God is spirit: and they who will worship him,
  ought to worship him in spirit and truth.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The woman said to him: 'We know that Mesias
  cometh, who is called "Christ;" if he should come, he will shew to us all
  things.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Jesus said to her: 'I who
  speak to thee am (he).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And upon
  (lit. in) this his disciples came, and they were wondering that he speaketh
  to a woman; no one however said to him: For what soughtest thou?' or,
  Wherefore speakest thou to her?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The
  woman then left her waterpot, and went to the city, and said to the men:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Come, see this man, who said to me
  all things which I did. Is this Christ?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> And they were coming from the city, and were
  coming to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> His disciples were
  beseeching him *between them and him, saying: Rabbi, rise, eat.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And he said to them: I have food to eat, which ye
  know not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> His disciples then were
  saying to one another: Did not some one bring to him (aught) to eat?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Jesus said to them: My own food is,
  that I may do (the) wish of him who sent me, and finish his work.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Say ye not, that yet four months
  (and) cometh the harvest? lo, I say to you: "Lift up your eyes, and see the
  fields (lit. countries), that they were white for (the) reaping them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Already he who will reap will receive
  his reward, and will gather fruit to eternal life: that he who soweth may
  rejoice together with him who reapeth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> For in this true is the word, that one soweth,
  and another reapeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> I sent you to
  reap that for which ye toiled not: others toiled, and ye went into their
  toil."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And from that city many of
  the Samaritans believed him, because of (the) word of the woman bearing
  witness, that he said all things which I did. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> When then the Samaritans came to him, they
  besought him that he would stay with them: and he stayed there two days.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And many more also believed because
  of his word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> They were saying then to
  the woman: `No longer because of thy speech we believe: for we ourselves
  heard (him), and we know truly that this is the Saviour of the world.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And after the two days he came from
  there to Galilee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> For Jesus himself
  bare witness, that there is not a prophet honoured in the city which is his
  own. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> When then he came to Galilee,
  the Galileans received him to them, having seen all things which he did in
  Jerusalem in (the) feast; for they also had come to (the) feast. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> He came again to (the) Cana of Galilee, the place
  in which he caused the water to become wine. There was a king's-officer,
  having a son sick in Kapharnaum. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> This
  (man) heard that Jesus came from Judea to Galilee: he went to him. and was
  beseeching him that he would come down, and cure his son; for he was about to
  die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Jesus then said to him: Unless
  ye see signs and wonders, ye believe not.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> The king's-officer said to him: 'My Lord, come
  down before my child die.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> Jesus said
  to him: Go, thy son liveth:' and the man believed the word which Jesus said
  to him, and he walked (away). <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> (As he
  is) now coming down, lo, his servants met him, saying: Thy son liveth.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> And he was asking of them for the
  hour in which he was relieved: they said to him, that in the seventh hour of
  yesterday the fever left him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> His
  father then knew, that it was that hour (in) which Jesus said to him: Thy son
  liveth:' and he believed, and his whole house. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> This is the second sign which Jesus did, having
  come from Judea to Galilee.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john5">5</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these (things) was (the)
  feast of the Jews; and Jesus came up to Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Now in Jerusalem by (lit. upon) the sheep (gate)
  there was a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethsaida,' having five porches:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> and in these were lying the multitudes
  of them who were sick, blind, and lame, and some withered. And it came to
  pass, (that as they were) looking for a moving of the water, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> there was an angel (who) came down every hour in
  the pool, and moved the water. And any (lit. every) one (who) shall come down
  first after the moving of the water shall be healed of every sickness which
  (may) be his. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And there was a man
  there, having been (lit. done) thirty-eight years in his sickness.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And Jesus having seen this (man) lying
  (lit. sleeping), and having known that he had been (lit. did) much time (in
  that state), [and] said to him: Wishest thou to be cured?'' He who was sick
  answered him, he said: <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> My Lord, I have
  not (a) man, that, if the water 'should be disturbed, he might put (lit.
  throw) me into the pool: but as I (am) coming, another getteth (lit. doeth)
  before me down.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Jesus said to him:
  Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And
  immediately the man was cured, and he took up his bed, he walked: (the)
  sabbath was that day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The Jews then
  were saying to him whom he healed: 'It is (the) sabbath; and it is not lawful
  for thee to take up thy bed.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But he
  said to them: He who caused me to be cured, he said to me, "Take up thy bed,
  go."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they asked him, saying: Who
  is the man who said to thee, "Take up thy bed, and walk?"' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But he who was cured was not knowing who it is:
  and Jesus had come forth, a multitude being in that place. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And after these (things) Jesus found him in the
  temple, and said to him: 'Lo, thou wast cured; sin not any more, lest greater
  evil happen to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The man then
  went, and he said to the Jews, that Jesus caused me to be cured. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Therefore, then, the Jews were persecuting Jesus;
  because he was doing these (things) on (the) sabbath. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Jesus said to them: 'Until now my Father
  worketh, and I also work.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Therefore,
  then, the Jews were seeking for him the more to kill him, because not only
  was he breaking the sabbath, but he was saying, that God is my Father, making
  himself equal with God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And Jesus
  answered and said to them: 'Verily, verily, I say to you, that it is not
  possible that (the) Son should do anything of himself, unless he see the
  Father doing it. For the things which the Father doeth, these likewise (lit.
  again) the Son also doeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> For the
  Father loveth (the) Son, and will show to him all things which he doeth; and
  greater works than these will he shew to him, that ye may wonder.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> For as the Father raiseth the dead,
  and maketh them live, thus again the Son also maketh live them whom he
  wisheth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> For the Father will not
  judge any one, but he gave all the judgement to the Son; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> that all might honour the Son as they honour the
  Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not [again] the Father also
  who sent him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Verily, verily, I say
  to you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him who sent me, hath
  eternal life, and will not come to (the) judgement, but removeth from (the)
  death into (the) life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Verily,
  verily, I say to you, that an hour cometh, which now is, when the dead will
  hear (the) voice of (the) Son of God, and they who will hear shall live.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> For as there is life being in the
  Father, thus he gave to the Son also that life should be in him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> and he gave authority to him to execute
  judgement, because (he) is a son of man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Wonder not at this; because an hour cometh, when
  all who are in the sepulchres shall hear his voice, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> and shall come forth; they who did the good
  (plur.) to a resurrection of life, and they who did the evil (plur.) to a
  resurrection of judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> It is not
  possible that I should do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge: and my own
  judgement is true, because I seek not for my wish, but (the) wish of him who
  sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> If I should bear witness
  concerning myself, my witness is not true. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Another beareth witness concerning me; and I know
  that his witness is true which he bare concerning me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Ye sent to John, and he bare witness to (the)
  truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But I was not receiving
  witness from [the] men: yet I say these (things) that ye might be saved.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> That (man), he was the lamp which was
  kindled, and which gave light; and ye were willing (lit. wished) to be
  gladdened for an hour in his light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span>
  But I have witness greater than that of John: for the works which my Father
  gave to me, that I might finish them, the works themselves which I do, bear
  witness about me that the Father sent me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And the Father who sent me, himself beareth
  witness concerning me. Neither heard ye ever his voice, nor saw his form.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And his word is not in you, because
  him whom he sent ye believed not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span>
  Search in the scriptures, of which ye think that there is eternal life being
  in them; and they bear witness concerning me; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and ye wish not to come to me, that life might be
  to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> I will not receive glory from
  man. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> But I knew you, that the love of
  God is not in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> I came in (the)
  name of my Father, and ye receive me not; and if another should come in his
  own name, ye will receive him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> How is
  it possible for you to believe, receiving glory from one another, and (the)
  glory from the one alone, ye seek not for? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Think ye that I will accuse you to the Father?
  there is (one) who will accuse you: Moses, in whom ye hoped. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> For if ye believed (imperf.) Moses, ye would
  believe me also, for he wrote concerning me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> If ye believe not the writings of that (man), how
  believe ye my words?'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john6">6</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> After these (things) Jesus went
  across the sea of Galilee of Tiberiados. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And a great multitude was walking after him,
  because they were seeing the signs which he was doing among them who are
  sick. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Jesus went up on the mountain,
  and he was sitting there with his disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the passover, (the) feast of the Jews, had
  approached. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Jesus then having lifted
  up his eyes, and having seen that there is a great multitude come to him,
  said to Philip: 'Where are we to find bread to buy, that these may eat?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And this he said tempting him; for he
  was knowing what he was intending to do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Philip answered him: Two hundred staters of bread
  will not suffice them, that they may take a little for each.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> One of his disciples, who is Andrew, (the) brother
  of Simon Peter, said to: <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> There is a
  child here having five barley loaves and two fishes: but how far (lit.
  whither) will these go (lit. reach) for these multitudes?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And Jesus said: Let the men sit down to meat.'
  Now there was much grass in that place. The men then sat down to meat upon
  the grass; (in) their number making five thousand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Jesus then took the loaves, and having given
  thanks, he gave to them who sat at meat: thus again of the fishes also, all
  that which they wished. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When then
  they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather the fragments which
  remained over, that there shall not be loss of them.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They gathered the (fragments) which remained
  over, and they filled twelve baskets with (ft) fragments of the five barley
  loaves which remained over to them who ate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> When then the men saw the signs which Jesus did,
  they were saying, that truly this is the prophet who cometh to the world.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Jesus having seen that they
  intend to come to take him by force, to make him king, withdrew upon the
  mountain himself alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And evening
  having come, his disciples came down to the sea; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> and having entered into the ship, they were
  coming across the sea to Kapharnaum. And (the) dusk had now come, and Jesus
  had not yet come to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the sea
  was being (lit. coming) disturbed (lit. awake), a great wind blowing.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Having then been distant about
  twenty-five stadia or thirty, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and
  drawing himself near to the ship, and they feared. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> But he said to them: I am (he), fear not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> They were wishing then to take (lit.
  place) him into the ship with them, and immediately the ship came to the
  shore to the land to which they were to go. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And on the (lit. his) morrow the multitude which
  was standing on the other side (lit. across) of the sea, saw (plur.) that
  there was (lit. is) not there another ship except one, and that Jesus entered
  not into the ship with his disciples, but his disciples had gone alone.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Other ships came from Tiberiados near
  the place in which they ate the bread, the Lord having given thanks over it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> When then the multitudes saw that
  Jesus (was) not there, nor his disciples, they themselves entered into the
  ships, and they came to Kapharnaum, seeking for Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And having found him across the sea, they said to
  him: Rabbi, when camest thou here <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span>
  Jesus answered them and said: Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye sought
  for me not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were
  satisfied. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Work, not the food which
  will perish, but the food which will abide to eternal life, that which (the)
  Son of (the) man will give to you; for this (one) God the Father sealed.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> They said then to him: What shall
  (lit. will) we do, that we may work the works of God?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Jesus answered, he said to them: This is the work
  of God, that ye believe him whom he sent.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> They said to him then: What sign doest thou, that
  we may see and believe thee? what work doest thou? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Our fathers ate the manna in (the) desert,
  according as it is written: "Bread from (the) heaven he gave to them to
  eat."' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Jesus said to them: Verily,
  verily, I say to you, that Moses gave not to you the bread from (the) heaven;
  but my Father (is he) who will give to you the true bread from (the) heaven.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> For the bread of God is he who cometh
  down from (the) heaven, and (is) giving (the) life to the world.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> They said to him: 'Lord, give to us
  this bread always.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Jesus said to
  them: 'I am the bread of (the) life: he who comoth to me shall not hunger,
  and he who believeth me shall not thirst for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> But I said (it) to you, and ye saw me, and ye
  believe not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Every one (lit. all
  that) whom my Father gave to me will come to me, and he who will come to me I
  shall not cast out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Because I came
  down from (the) heaven, not that I might do my will, but the (lit. his) will
  of him who sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> This is (the)
  wish of him who sent me, that of all (lit. all that) whom he gave to me I
  should not lose any of them, but should raise him in the last day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> For this is (the) wish of my Father,
  that every one (lit. all that) who seeth the Son, and believeth him, should
  be having eternal life, and that I should raise him in the last day.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> The Jews then were murmuring
  concerning him, because he said, that I am the bread which came down from
  (the) heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And they were saying:
  Is this not Jesus (the) son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how
  saith he now, that I came down from (the) heaven?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Jesus answered, he said to them: Murmur not with
  one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> It is not possible that
  any should come to me, unless the Father who sent me draw him to me, and I
  raise him in the last day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> It is
  written in the prophets, that they shall be all the taught of God: every one
  (lit. all that) who heard of my Father, and learned (lit. known), will come
  to me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Not that any one saw the
  Father, except him who is from God, this (one) saw the Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that he who
  believeth me hath eternal life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> I am
  the bread of (the) life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Your fathers
  ate the manna in (the) desert and died. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And this is the bread which cometh down from
  (the) heaven, that he who will eat of it should not die. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(51)</span> I am the living bread, that which (or, he who)
  came down from (the) heaven: he who will eat of this bread shall live for
  ever; and the bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for
  (the) life of the world.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> The Jews
  then contended with one another, saying: How is it possible that this (man)
  should give his flesh to us to eat? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span>
  Jesus said to them: 'Verily, verily, I say to you, that unless ye eat (the)
  flesh of (the) Son of (the) man, and drink his blood, ye have not life in
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> He who eateth my flesh, and who
  drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him in the last day.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> For my flesh is true food, and my
  blood is true drink. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> He who eateth my
  flesh, and who drinketh my blood, will abide in me, and I also will abide in
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> As my Father, who liveth, sent
  me, and I also live because of the Father; so (lit. and) he who eateth me,
  also shall live because of me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> This
  is the bread which came down from (the) heaven: not as the fathers who ate,
  and died; he who will eat this bread shall live for ever.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(59)</span> These (things) he said, teaching in their
  synagogue in Kapharnaum. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> Many then of
  his disciples having heard, said: This word is hard, and who will be able to
  hear it?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> But Jesus having seen in
  himself, that his disciples murmured concerning this, said to them: 'Doth
  this offend you? <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> (What) if ye should
  see (the) Son of (the) man going up to the place in which he was being at
  first? <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> The Spirit maketh live: the
  flesh profiteth not anything. The words which I said to you are spirit and
  are life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> But there are some of you
  (who) believe not. For Jesus was knowing from (the) beginning who were they
  who believe not, and who was to deliver him (up). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(65)</span> And he was saying to them: Therefore I said to
  you, that it is not possible that any one should come to me unless it were
  given to him of the Father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(66)</span>
  Therefore many of his disciples fled back, and were walking with him no
  longer. <span style="color:#b00e23">(67)</span> Jesus then said to the
  twelve: Wish ye also to go?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(68)</span> Simon
  Peter answered him: Lord, to whom are we to go? for words of eternal life
  thou hast. <span style="color:#b00e23">(69)</span> And we knew and believed
  that thou art Christ, the holy one (lit. he who is holy) of God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(70)</span> Jesus answered, he said: Chose not I
  you as (lit. under) the twelve, and one of you is for a devil?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(71)</span> Now he was saying (it) of (lit, for) Judas Simon
  the Iscariot; for this (man) was intending to deliver him (up), being one of
  the twelve.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john7">7</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after these (things) Jesus was
  walking in Galilee; for he was not wishing to walk in Judea, because the Jews
  were seeking for him to kill him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Now
  (the) feast of the Jews, the feast-of-tabernacles, was approaching.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> His brothers then said to him: 'Remove
  from here (lit. this), and go to Judea, that thy disciples may see thy works
  which thou doest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> For no one worketh
  in secret, and seeketh for himself to be manifested (lit. in manifest): if
  thou wilt do these (things) manifest thyself to the world.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> For neither were his brothers also believing him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Jesus then said to them: My time
  cometh not yet; but your time is prepared always. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> It is not possible that the world hate you; but me
  it hateth, because I bear witness concerning it, that its works are evil.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And go ye up to (the) feast: and I
  will not come up to the feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And having said these (things), he
  (is) in Galilee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But when his
  brothers went up to (the) feast, then he also came up not manifestly but as
  in secret. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The Jews then were seeking
  for him in (the) feast, and they were saying: Where. is that (man)?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And there was a great murmuring in
  the multitude concerning him: some indeed were saying: 'He is good;' and
  others were saying: No, but he led the multitude astray.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> No one however spake concerning him manifestly,
  because of (the) fear of the Jews. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  But now the feast having been half over, Jesus came up to the temple, and was
  teaching. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The Jews then were
  wondering, saying: How knoweth this (man) writing, he was not taught?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Jesus answered them, and said: 'My
  teaching is not mine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He who will do
  the wish of him who sent me, shall know my teaching, whether it is of God, or
  (if) I speak from myself. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> He who
  speaketh from himself, sought for his own glory: but he who seeketh for (the)
  glory of him who sent him, this (one) is true, and there is not
  unrighteousness in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Did not Moses
  give to you the law, and there is not any among you doing the law? wherefore
  seek ye for me to kill me? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the
  multitude answered: There is a demon with thee: who seeketh for thee to kill
  thee?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Jesus answered, he said to
  them: 'One work I did, and ye all wonder. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore Moses gave to you the circumcision; not
  that the circumcision is of Moses, but it is of the fathers, and ye
  circumcise a man on (the) sabbath. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> If
  a man is to receive the circumcision on (the) sabbath, that the law of Moses
  shall not be broken; wherefore are ye angry with me, because I caused a man
  to be wholly cured on (the) sabbath? <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Judge not according to appearance (lit. face), but judge with righteous
  judgement.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Some then of them of
  Jerusalem were saying: 'Is not this he whom they seek for to kill him?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Lo, he speaketh openly, and they say
  nothing to him? Did indeed the rulers know truly that this is Christ?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But we know this (man), from where
  (he) is: but if Christ should come, no one will know from where (he) is.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Jesus then cried out in the temple,
  teaching and saying: Ye know me, and ye know from where I came. And I came
  not from myself, but he who sent me is true; he whom ye know not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And I know him; because I am of him,
  and it is he who sent me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> They were
  seeking then to apprehend him, and no one laid (lit. brought) his hands upon
  him, because his hour had not yet come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Many then of the multitude believed him, and they
  were saying: 'If Christ should come, will he do more indeed than these signs
  which this (man) did?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The Pharisees
  heard the multitudes murmuring these (things) concerning him; and the chief
  priests and the Pharisees sent officers that they might apprehend him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Jesus then said: Yet a little time I
  am with you, and I will go to him who sent me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Ye seek for me, and ye will not find me; and
  (the) place to which I will go, ye will not be able to come to it.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> The Jews then said to one another:
  Whither will this (man) go, and we will not find him? will he go to the
  scattered among (lit. of) the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> What is this word which he said: "Ye will seek
  for me, and ye will not find me; and the place to which I will go, it is not
  possible for you to come to it?"' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Now
  in the last day of the great feast Jesus stood, and cried out, saying: He who
  thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> He who believeth me, according as the scripture
  said: "Rivers of water of life will flow from his belly."' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But this he said concerning the Spirit, which
  they who believe him were to receive: for (the) Spirit had not yet come;
  because Jesus had not yet been glorified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And some of the multitude having heard these
  words, were saying: Truly this is the Prophet.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And others were saying: `This is Christ:' but
  others were saying: 'Is Christ coming from Galilee? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Said not the scripture, that (he) is from (the)
  seed of David, and that Christ is coming from Bethlehem, the village where
  David was (imperf.)?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> A division then
  happened in the multitude because of him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And some among them were wishing to apprehend
  him; but no one could lay (lit. bring) his hands upon him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> The officers then came to the chief priests and
  the Pharisees; and those said to them: 'Wherefore brought ye him not?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> The officers answered, saying: 'Never
  man spake thus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the Pharisees
  answered them, sayingWent ye also astray? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> Did any of the rulers believe him, or of the
  Pharisees? <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> But this multitude who
  know not the law are under (the) curse.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> Nicodemus said to them, he who came to Jesus (at)
  first by night, being one of them <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span>
  Will our law judge the man, unless it hear him first, and know what he doeth?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> They answered him, saying 'Art thou
  also from Galilee? 'Search and see, that thereis not (a) prophet to rise from
  Galilee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> And they went each to his
  place.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john8">8</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And Jesus went to the mountain of
  the Olives. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Then he came in the
  morning to the temple, and the multitudes came to him; and he sat to
  teachthem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the chief priests and
  the Pharisees brought to him a woman: they found her in adultery; and they
  made her stand in (the) midst, <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> and
  said to him: 'Teacher, this woman we found in adultery. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And (the) law of Moses commanded to stone her; but
  what sayest thou?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And this they said
  tempting him, that they might find pretext against (lit. upon) him. But Jesus
  bent down hiseyes, he wrote with his finger upon the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But they having delayed for his answer, he lifted
  his head, he said to them:Who among you (is) without sin, let him stone her
  first with a stone.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then he bent down
  his head, and wrote upon the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Having heard this from him, [and] they understood his reproof. They began to
  come forth each (of them), until had come forth the elders and all of them
  (lit. their multitude); and left was Jesus alone with the woman who was
  (imperf.) set in (the) midst. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Jesus
  lifted up his head, he said to her O woman, where were they who judged thee?
  there is not one judging thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> She
  said to him: 'I see not one, my Lord.' Said Jesus to her: 'Neither (am) I
  judging thee: go, Henceforth return not to sin any more.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Again Jesus spake to them, saying: 'I am (the)
  light of the world, he who will walk after me, shall not walk in the
  darkness, but shall receive (the) light of (the) life.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The Pharisees then said to him: Thou thyself
  bearest witness about thyself; thy witness is not true.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Jesus answered and said to them: 'Even if I
  should bear witness about myself, true is my witness, because I know whence I
  came, and whither I am to go. But ye know not whence I came, or whither I am
  to go. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Ye judged according to flesh;
  and I judge not any one. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And if I
  should judge, my judgement is true, because I am not alone, but I and he who
  sent me, the Father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And it is
  written indeed again in your law, that (the) witness of two men is true.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I bear witness about myself, and the
  Father who sent me beareth witness about me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> They were saying then: 'Where was thy Father?'
  Jesus answered: 'Ye know neither me, nor even my Father: if ye knew (imperf.)
  me, ye would know also my Father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  These words he spake in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one
  could lay hold on him, because his hour had not yet come. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Again Jesus said to them: 'I will go, and ye will
  seek for me, and ye will not find me. And ye will die in your sins, and the
  place to which I will go, it is not possible for you to come to it.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The Jews then were saying: Is he
  about to kill himself, because he saith, that the place to which I will go ye
  will not be able to come to it?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  he was saying to them: 'Ye are of them who are beneath; and I am from above:
  ye are of the world; and I am not of this world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> I said then to you, that ye will die in your
  sins: for unless ye believe that I am (he), ye will die in your sins.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> They were saying then to him: Who
  (art) thou?' Jesus said to them: At the beginning I also told (lit. made
  (the) word also with) you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> I have
  many things to say concerning you, and to judge. But he who sent me is true,
  and the things which I heard from him these I also speak in the world.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> They knew not that he was speaking to
  them concerning the Father. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Jesus
  said to them: If ye should lift up (the) Son of (the) man, then ye shall know
  that I am (he); and I do not anything from myself; but according as the
  Father taught me, these (things) I speak. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And he who sent me is with me; and he left me not
  alone, because I do the things which please him always.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> (As he is) saying these (things), many believed
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Jesus then was saying to the
  Jews who believed him: 'If ye should stay in my word, truly ye (will be) my
  disciples; <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> and ye shall know (the)
  truth, and (the) truth shall make you free.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> They answered, saying to him: We (are) of (the)
  seed of Abraam, and we served not any one ever, how sayest thou, that ye
  shall be made free?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Jesus answered
  them: 'Verily, verily, I say to you, that every one who doeth (the) sin, is a
  servant of (the) sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And the servant
  stayeth not in the house for ever: but the son stayeth for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> If then the Son should make you free, ye will
  really be made free. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> I know that ye
  (are) of (the) seed of Abraam, but ye seek for me to kill me, because my word
  is not in you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> The things then which
  I saw from my Father, these I speak; and the things which ye heard from your
  father ye do.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> They answered, they
  said to him: Our father (is) Abraam.' Jesus said to them: 'If ye were (the)
  sons of Abraam, the works of Abraam ye would do. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But now ye seek for me to kill me, a man saying
  (the) truth to you, which I heard from God: this did not Abraam. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Ye do the works of your father.' They said to
  him: 'We (were) not begotten (lit. generations) of (the) fornication: one
  (lit. a) Father alone we have, (even) God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Jesus said to them: If God were your Father, ye
  would love me: for I came from God, and I came: for I came not of myself, but
  he sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Wherefore ye know not my
  speech, because it is not possible for you to hear my word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> Ye are from your father the devil, and the lusts
  of your father ye wish to do: that (one) was a murderer from (the) beginning,
  and stood not in (the) truth ever, because there is not truth in him. If the
  false (one) should speak, he speaketh from the things which are his own,
  because (he) is false, and his father also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(45)</span> But I say (the) truth to you, (and) ye believe me
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Which of you will convict me
  concerning sin? If the truth I say to you, wherefore believe ye me not?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> He who is (lit. the) from God heareth
  the words of God: therefore ye hear not, because ye are not from God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> The Jews answered and said to him:
  Well said we, that thou (art) a Samaritan, and there is a demon with thee.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Jesus answered and said: There is not
  a demon with me; but I honour my Father; and ye despise me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(50)</span> But I was not seeking for mine own glory, there
  is he who seeketh and who judgeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span>
  Verily, verily, I say to you, that if any one should keep my word, he shall
  never see (the) death.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> The Jews
  said: Now we know (lit.? knew) that there is a demon with thee. Abraam died,
  and the prophets also; and thou sayest: "He who will keep my word, shall
  never taste (the) death." <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> Art thou
  greater than our father Abraam, who died, and the prophets also died? whom
  madest thou thyself?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> Jesus answered,
  saying: If I should glorify myself, my glory is nothing: my Father is he who
  will glorify me. He (of) whom ye say, that (he) is our God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And ye knew him not: but I know him. And if I
  should say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, false: but I know
  him, and I keep his word <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> .Abraam your
  father was (imperf.) glad, wishing to see a day of mine; and he saw, he
  rejoiced.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(57)</span> The Jews said to him: Thou
  hast (lit. doest) not yet fifty years, and sawest thou Abraam?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(58)</span> Jesus said to them: Verily, verily, I say to you,
  that before Abraam was, I am.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> They
  took up stones then, that they might cast upon him: but Jesus hid himself, he
  came from the temple, and he passed by, he was walking in their midst, and he
  was passing by.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john9">9</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And passing, he saw a man blind
  from birth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And his disciples asked
  him, saying: Rabbi, who sinned? this (man) is it, or his parents is it, that
  he was born being blind?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Jesus
  answered: Neither this (man) sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of
  God might appear in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> We must work
  the works of him who sent us while it is the day; and the night cometh, when
  it is not possible that any one work. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span>
  While I am in the world, I am (the) light of the world.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Having said these (things), he cast spittle down,
  and he made clay from the spittle, and he anointed (the) eyes of the blind
  from birth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And he said to him: Go,
  wash thy face in the pool of the Siloam,' which they interpret he who was
  sent.' He went then, he washed his face, and he came seeing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> His neighbours then, and they who knew him at
  first, that he was one begging alms, were saying: 'Is this not he who was
  sitting, begging alms?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Some indeed
  were saying that it is he; and others were saying: Nay, but he was like him.'
  And he was saying: I am (he).' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> They
  were saying then to him: How were thine eyes opened?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> That (man) answered, he said: The man who is
  called "Jesus," he made clay, he anointed my eyes, and he said to me: "Go,
  wash thy face in the Siloam." I wont then, I washed my face, I saw.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> They said to him: Where also was that
  man?' He said: I know not.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> They then
  brought to the Pharisees him who was (imperf.) once blind. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Now it was (the) sabbath (on) which Jesus made
  the clay, and caused his eyes to be opened. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Again then the Pharisees were asking him: How
  sawest thou?' and he said to them: Clay he put upon mine eyes, and I washed
  myself, I saw.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Some of the Pharisees
  then were saying: 'This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the
  sabbath.' But others were saying: 'How is it possible that a sinful man
  should do such signs? ' and a division was happening among them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Again then they said to the blind man: What
  sayest thou concerning him, because he opened thine eyes? ' And he said: He
  is a prophet.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The Jews trusted him
  not, that he was (imperf.) blind, and saw, until they called his parents,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and asked them, saying: Is this your
  son whom ye say that he was born (lit. we bare him) being blind? how then saw
  he now?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> His parents answered, and
  said: We know that this is our son, and that he was (lit. we) born being
  blind. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> How then he saw now, we know
  not: or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he himself has age also to
  speak concerning himself.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> These
  (things) said his parents, since they were fearing the Jews: for the Jews had
  settled, that if any one should confess that (he) is Christ, he should be put
  out of the synagogue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Therefore his
  parents said: 'He has age also; ask him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> They called then the man (the) second time, this
  (one) who was (imperf.) blind, and they said to him: Glorify God: we know
  that this man is a sinner.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He who
  was (imperf.) blind answered, saying: 'If (he) is a sinner, I know not: but
  one (thing) I know, that I was (imperf.) blind, but now I see.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> They said to him What did he to thee? How opened
  he thine eyes?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He answered them:
  told (lit. said) you already, and ye heard not. What again wish ye to hear?
  wish ye also to become disciples to him?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And they railed at him, saying: Thou (art) a
  disciple of that (man): but we are disciples of Moses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> We know that God spake to Moses, but this (man)
  we know not from where (he) is.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> The
  man answered, he said to them: This indeed is the wonder, that ye know not
  from where he is, and he opened mine eyes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> We know that God heareth not sinners, but if any
  one is a worshipper of God, and (is) doing his wish; this (one) he heareth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Since the beginning of the world
  (lit. from (the) age) we heard not, that any one opened (the) eyes of a (man)
  blind from birth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> If this (man) is
  not of God, he would not be able to do anything.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> They answered and said to him: Thou wast begotten
  (lit. art a generation) altogether in (the) sin; and wilt thou teach us?' And
  they cast him out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Jesus heard
  that they cast him out; and having found him, said: 'Believest thou (the) Son
  of God? ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> He answered, he said: Who
  is he, my Lord, that I may believe him?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Jesus said to him: Thou seest him, and it is he
  who speaketh to thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he said: I
  believe, my Lord:' and he worshipped him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And Jesus said: I came for judgement of the
  world, that they who are blind may see; and they who see may become blind.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Some of the Pharisees who were with
  him heard, and they said to him: Are we blind also?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Jesus said to them: If ye were blind, ye had not
  sin; but now ye say: "We see:" and your sin abideth.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john10">10</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that

  a shepherd of the sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> To this (one)

  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And if he should bring out all them which are his
  own, he walketh before them, and the sheep walk after him, because they know
  his voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And they walk not after the
  stranger, but they shall flee from him, because they know not (the) voice of
  the stranger.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> This proverb Jesus said
  to them: but they knew not wherefore he spake to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Again, Jesus said to them: 'Verily, verily, I say
  to you, that I am the door of the sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> All who came before me are robbers and are
  thieves; but the sheep hearkened not to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I am the door of the sheep: he who will come in
  through me shall be saved; and he shall come in, and he shall come out, and
  shall find a pasture. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the thief
  cometh not except haply that he may steal, and slay, and destroy; I came that
  life might be to them, and that abundance might be to them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth
  his life (lit. soul) for his sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  But the hireling, and (he) who is not a shepherd, he whose own the sheep are
  not, if he should see the wolf coming, he fleeth and leaveth the sheep; and
  the wolf snatcheth them and scattereth them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Because (he) is a hireling, and he careth not for
  the sheep. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I am the good' shepherd, I
  know them who are mine, and they who are mine know me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> According as my Father knew me, I also know the
  Father; and I will lay (down) my life (lit. soul) for my sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> I have other sheep, who are not of this fold; I
  must bring the others, and they shall hear my voice, and they shall be one
  flock, one shepherd. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Therefore my
  Father loveth me, because I lay (down) my life (lit. soul), that I may take
  it again. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> No one taketh it away from
  me, but I (am he) who lay it down of myself: I have authority to lay it
  (down); I have authority to take it again: this is the commandment which I
  took from my Father.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> A division then
  happened among the Jews because of these words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And many then of them were saying: There is a
  demon with him, and he is mad: wherefore hear ye him?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And others were saying: These words are not the
  (words) of a man having (lit. being) a demon with him: is it possible for a
  demon to open (the) eyes of blind men?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The (lit. a) Dedication happened at that time in
  Jerusalem: it was (the) winter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And
  Jesus was walking in the temple under the porch of Solomon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> The Jews then surrounded him, and they said to
  him: How long dost thou hold us in suspense? if thou art Christ, say to us
  openly.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Jesus answered them: I said
  to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in (the) name of my Father,
  they bear witness about me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But ye
  believe me not, because ye (are) not of my sheep. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> My own sheep hear my voice, and walk after me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And I also will give to them eternal
  life; and they shall not perish for ever; and no one shall be able to snatch
  them from my hand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> That which my
  Father gave to me is greater than all; and there is not any one (who) will be
  able to snatch them from (the) hand of my Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> I and my Father are one.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The Jews then took up stones that they might cast
  upon him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Jesus answered them,
  saying: Many good works I shewed to you from my Father, for which work then
  will ye stone me?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> The Jews answered
  him: For a good work we will stone thee not, but for blasphemy, because thou,
  a man thyself, makest thee God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span>
  Jesus answered and said: it not written in your law: "I said, that ye (are)
  gods?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> If he called (lit. said) them
  "god," to whom (the) word of God came, and it is not possible that the
  scripture should be broken, <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> (of) him
  whom the Father hallowed, and sent to the world ye say, that thou
  blasphemedst, because I said, that I am (the) Son of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> If I do not the works of my Father believe me
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> But if I do them, even if ye
  should not believe me, believe the works, that ye may learn and know that I
  am in my Father, and my Father in me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Again they were seeking for him to apprehend him;
  and he fled from their hands; <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and
  went again across the Jordan, the place in which John was baptising at first,
  and he abode there. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And many came to
  him, and they were saying: John indeed did not any sign: all things which he
  said concerning this (man) are true.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span>
  And many believed him there.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john11">11</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now there was one sick, namely,
  Lazarus of Bethany, of (the) village of Mary and Martha her sister.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And this was Mary who anointed the
  Lord with the ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother
  Lazarus was (imperf.) sick. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> His
  sisters then sent to him, saying: Lord, lo, he whom thou lovest is sick.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But Jesus having heard, said: This
  disease is not a disease of (the) death, but for (the) glory of God; that
  (the) Son of God may be glorified through it.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Now Jesus was loving Martha and Mary her sister
  and Lazarus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then therefore having
  heard that he is sick, he abode in the place in which he was (imperf.) two
  days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> After this he said to his
  disciples: Let us go to Judea again.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span>
  His disciples said to him: Rabbi, (just) now the Jews were seeking for thee
  to stone thee, and thou wilt go again thither.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the
  day? he who walketh in the day stumbleth not, for (lit. and) he saw (the)
  light of the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> But he who
  walketh in the night stumbleth, because the light (is) not in him.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Having said these (things), after
  this (plur.) he said to them: Lazarus our friend slept, but I shall go, that
  I may raise him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The disciples said
  to him: Lord, if he slept, he shall rise.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Now Jesus said (it) concerning the sleep of his
  death. But they were thinking that he said (it) concerning the sleep of the
  slumber. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then Jesus said to them
  openly: Lazarus died. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And I rejoice
  because of you, that ye may believe, that I was (imperf.) not there; but let
  us go unto him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Thomas then, who is
  called Didymus,' said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may
  die with him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Jesus then having
  come, found him, having been four days (lit. being his four) in the
  sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Now Bethany was (imperf.)
  near to Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And many of the Jews had come to Mary and Martha,
  concerning their brother. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Martha then
  having heard that Jesus cometh, rose, she met him; but Mary was sitting in
  the house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Martha then said to Jesus:
  My Lord, if thou hadst (imperf.) been here, my brother would not have died.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> But now then I know, that that which
  thou wilt ask from God, God will give to thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Jesus said to her: 'Thy brother will rise.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Martha, said to him: I know that he
  will rise in the resurrection, in the last day.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the
  life: he who believeth me, even if he should die, shall live: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and every one who liveth and who believeth me
  shall not die for ever: thou believest this.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> She said to him: My Lord, I believe that thou art
  Christ, (the) Son of God, who cometh to the world.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And having said this, she went, she called Mary
  her sister secretly, having said to her: 'The Teacher is here (lit. this),
  and calleth thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And she having
  heard, rose quickly, and she came to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For Jesus had not yet come up to (the) village;
  but he was (imperf.) then in the place in which Martha came to him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The Jews then who were (imperf.) with
  her within the house comforting her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly,
  and came out, walked after her, thinking to themselves, that she is about to
  depart to the sepulchre, that she may weep there. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Mary then having come to the place in which Jesus
  was (imperf.); and having seen him, threw herself down at his feet, saying:
  My Lord, if thou hadst (imperf.) been here, my brother would not have died.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Jesus then having seen her weeping,
  and the Jews also who came with her weeping, was pained in the spirit, and
  was troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And he said to them:
  'Where laid ye him?' They said to him: Lord, come and see.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And his eyes shed (lit. gave) tears. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> The Jews then were saying: 'See how he loveth
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But some of them said: Was it
  not possible for this (man), who opened (the) eyes of the blind from birth,
  that he should not permit this other (one) to die?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Jesus then had compassion in himself, he came to
  the sepulchre. Now it was a cave, and there was a great stone put (lit.
  given) against it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Jesus said to
  them: Take (away) this stone [there]:' Martha, (the) sister of him who died,
  said to him: 'Lord, he stinketh, for (it is) his four(th day) to-day.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Jesus said to her: Said I not to
  thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou wilt see (the) glory of God? '
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> They then took away the stone from
  the mouth of the sepulchre. And Jesus lifted his eyes up, and said: My
  Father, I give thanks to thee, because thou heardest me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And I was knowing that thou hearest me always;
  but because of this multitude which surrounds me I said (it), that they may
  believe, that thou sentest me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And
  having said these (things), he cried out with a great voice: Lazarus, come
  forth.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And he who died came forth,
  being bound as to his feet and his hands with grave-clothes, and his face
  bound with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Unloose him, send him away, let him
  go.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Many then of the Jews who came
  to Mary, having seen the things which he did, believed him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(46)</span> But some of them went to the Pharisees, they told
  to them that which Jesus did. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> The
  chief priests then and the Pharisees assembled an assembly. and they were
  saying: `What shall (lit. will) we do? many are the signs which this man
  doeth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> If we should permit him thus,
  all will believe him, and the Romans will come, they will take away our place
  and our nation.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span> But one of them
  answered, his name being Kaiapha, being chief priest for that year. He said
  to them: "Ye know not anything; <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> nor
  reason ye to yourselves, that it is profitable for you, that (one) man alone
  should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Now he said not this from himself;
  but because he was (imperf.) chief priest for that year, he prophesied that
  Jesus must die for the nation; <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> and
  not for the nation alone, but (must) assemble into one the sons also of God
  who are scattered. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> From that hour
  they took counsel that they might kill him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(54)</span> And Jesus was not walking any more manifestly in
  Judea, but he went from there to a country near the desert, to a city called
  'Ephrem,' and he abode there with his disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(55)</span> Now the passover of the Jews was approaching; and
  many came up to Jerusalem from the country before the passover, that they
  might hallow themselves. <span style="color:#b00e23">(56)</span> The Jews
  then were seeking for Jesus, saying to one another, standing in the temple
  What think ye, that he will not come to (the) feast?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> The chief priests and the Pharisees had given
  commandment, that if any one should know where he was, he should shew him to
  them, that they might apprehend him.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john12">12</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Jesus then six days before the
  passover (lit. before six days of the passover) came to Bethany, the place in
  which Lazarus was (imperf.), who died, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> They made a supper for him in that
  place, and Martha was ministering, and Lazarus was one of them who sat at
  meat with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Mary then took a pound
  of ointment of pistic nard, being of great price, and she anointed (the) feet
  of Jesus with it, and she wiped them with (the) hair of her head; and the
  house was filled with (lit. from) the odour of the ointment. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But one of his disciples, who was (lit. is) Judas
  (the) Iscariot, who was to deliver him (up), said: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Wherefore was not this ointment sold for three
  hundred staters, and they be given to the poor?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now he said this, not because he cared about the
  poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag he was carrying the
  things which he used to throw into it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  Jesus then said: Permit her that she may keep it to (the) day of my
  embalming. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> For the poor are with you
  always, but I am not with you always.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  And a great multitude of the Jews knew that he is there; and they came not
  because of Jesus alone, but besides because of Lazarus also, that they might
  see him whom he raised from the dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> because many of the Jews were
  departing because of him, and were believing Jesus. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And on the (lit. his) morrow, the great multitude
  who came to (the) feast, having heard that Jesus cometh up to Jerusalem,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> took branches from palm-trees, and
  met him, and were crying out, saying: Osanna, blessed is he who cometh in
  (the) name of the Lord, and (the) king of Israel.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And Jesus having found an ass, mounted it,
  according as it is written: <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Fear not,
  Daughter of Sion; behold, thy King cometh mounted on a colt (the) foal (]it.
  son) of an ass.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And these (things)
  his disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they
  remembered that they did these (things) to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The multitude then, which was (imperf.) with him,
  was bearing witness, that he called Lazarus from the sepulchre, and raised
  him from the dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Therefore the
  multitudes were coming forth to him, because they heard that he did this
  sign. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The Pharisees then said to one
  another: We see that we shall (lit. will) not gain anything; lo, the whole
  world went after (lit. behind) him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  Now there were Greeks of them who came up to (the) feast that they might
  worship. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> These then were coming to
  Philip the man of Bethsaida of Galilee, and they were beseeching him, saying:
  Our Lord, we wish to see Jesus.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  Philip came, he said (it) to Andrew; Andrew again and Philip came, they said
  (it) to Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And Jesus answered, he
  said to them: 'The hour came that (the) Son of (the) man should be glorified.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that
  unless the grain of wheat fall upon the earth and die, it abideth alone: but
  if it should die, it bringeth forth much fruit. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> He who loveth his life (lit. soul) shall lose it;
  and he who hateth his life (lit. soul) in this world shall keep it to eternal
  life. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> He who will minister to me, let
  him follow me; and (the) place in which I am, there shall be with me my
  minister; and he who will be minister to me, my Father will honour him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Now was my soul troubled; and what
  shall (lit. will) I say? my Father save me from this hour; but therefore came
  I to this hour. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Father, glorify thy
  Son.' A voice came from (the) heaven, saying: I glorified, again I will
  glorify.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> The multitude then, which
  was standing (by), having heard were saying, that thunder happened. But
  others were saying, that an angel spake to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Jesus answered and said: This voice happened not
  because of me, but because of you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span>
  Now (is the) judgement of this world; now shall (the) ruler of this world be
  cast out. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And if I also should be
  lifted up from (the) earth, I shall draw every one to me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But this he was saying, signifying with what
  death he will die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> The multitude
  answered him, saying: We heard from the law that Christ abideth for ever; and
  how sayest thou that (the) Sou of (the) man must be lifted up? who is (the)
  Son of (the) man? <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Jesus said to them:
  Yet a little time (is) the light among you: walk then in the light, while ye
  have the light; that the darkness apprehend you not, because he who walketh
  in the darkness knoweth not whither he went. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> While ye have the light, walk in the light, that
  ye may become sons of the light.' Jesus having said these (things) went, he
  hid himself from them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> But having
  done so many (lit. these multitudes of) signs before them, they believed him
  not. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> That (the) word of Esaias the
  prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who believed our voice? and
  to whom was revealed (the) arm of the Lord?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Therefore it was not possible for them to
  believe, and Esaias said again: <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> He
  hardened their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they might not see with
  their eyes, and understand in their heart, and might return to me, that I
  might cure them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> These (things) said
  Esaias, because he saw (the) glory of God, and spake concerning him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Nevertheless many of the rulers also
  believed him: but they were not confessing him because of the Pharisees, lest
  they should be put out of the synagogue: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> for they loved (the) glory of [the] men rather
  than (the) glory of God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And Jesus
  cried out and said: He who believeth me, believeth not me, but he believed
  him who sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And he who seeth me
  seeth him who sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> I came for a
  light of the world, that every one who believeth in me might not stay in
  (the) darkness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And he who will hear
  my words, and will keep them not, I am not (he) who will judge him; for I
  came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> He who denieth me, and who receiveth
  not my words, hath that which will judge him: the word which I spake, that
  will judge him in the last day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(49)</span>
  Because I spake not from myself; but he who sent me, he gave commandment to
  me what I shall (lit. will) say or what I shall (lit. will) speak.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span> And I know that his commandment is
  eternal life; the (things) then which I say, according as my Father said to
  me, thus I speak.'</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john13">13</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now before (the) feast of the
  passover, Jesus having seen that his hour came, that he should remove from
  this world, and (lit. about to) go to the Father; having loved them who were
  his own, who were in the world, he (lit. having) loved them until the end.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And supper having been (ended), the
  devil had already put (lit. thrown) into (the) heart of him who was to
  deliver him (up), who was (lit. is) Judas Simon (the) Iscariot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And Jesus having seen that the Father gave
  everything into his hands, and that he came from God, and is to go to God,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> rose from the supper, laid his
  garments down, and took a towel, he girt himself with it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he poured (lit. threw) water into a bason, and
  began to wash (the) feet of his disciples, and (is) wiping them with the
  towel with which he was (imperf.) girt. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He came then to Simon Peter, about to wash his
  foot: Peter said to him: Lord, wilt thou wash my foot?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Jesus answered and said to him: That whichI do,
  thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these (things).' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Peter said to him: Thou shalt never wash my foot.'
  Jesus answered: Verily, verily, I say to thee: Unless I wash thy foot, thou
  hast not part with me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Simon Peter
  said to him: My Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Jesus said to him: He who was washed
  hath not need except to wash his foot, but he is altogether clean, and ye
  also are clean, but not all.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For he
  was knowing who was to deliver him (up); therefore he was saying: Ye are not
  all clean.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When then he (had) washed
  their feet, he took his garments, and having sat down to meat again, he said
  to them: Ye know what I did to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  Ye call me "Teacher" and "our Lord;" ye say well, for I am (it). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> If then I washed your feet, your Lord and your
  Teacher, ye also ought to wash the (lit. their) feet of one another.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> For I gave (lit. did) to you a
  pattern, that according as I did to you, ye also might do to one another.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that
  there is not a servant [being] greater than his Lord, nor an apostle [being]
  greater than he who sent him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> If ye
  know these (things), blessed are ye if ye should do them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I was not saying (it) concerning you all: for I
  know them whom I chose, but that the scripture may be fulfilled: "He who
  eateth my bread with me raised his heel upon me." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> [From] now I say to you before it happen, that if
  it should happen, ye may believe that I am (he). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that he who
  receiveth him whom I will send receiveth me; and he who receiveth me
  receiveth him who sent me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Jesus
  having said these (things), was troubled in the spirit, and bare witness, and
  said: Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me (up).'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> His disciples then were gazing at one
  another, they knew not which of them he said it was. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And one of his disciples was reclining in the
  bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus was loving. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Simon Peter then beckoned to this (one), that he
  might ask him whom he said it was. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span>
  And that disciple having leant upon (the) breast of Jesus said to him: My
  Lord, who is (it)?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Jesus answered,
  saying: He, to whom I will dip the sop and give it, is he:' and he dipped the
  sop, and he gave it to Judas Simon (the) Iscariot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And after the sop Satan went into him. Jesus then
  said to him: 'That which thou wilt do, do quickly.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Now no one among those who sat at meat knew of
  this word, wherefore he said (it) to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And some were thinking, that, since Judas was
  having the bag, [that] perhaps Jesus is saying to him: Buy that of which we
  shall (lit. will) have need for (the) feast; ' or, that he might give
  something to the poor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> That (man)
  then having received the sop came forth immediately; and it was night.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> When then he came forth, Jesus said:
  Now (the) Son of (the) man was glorified, and God was glorified in him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> If God was glorified in him, [and]
  God will glorify him in himself, and immediately shall glorify him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> My sons, yet a little I am with you:
  ye shall seek for me, and according as I said to the Jews, that the place to
  which I will go, ye will not be able to come to it; so (lit. and) now to you
  also I say (it). <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> A new commandment I
  give to you, that ye may love one another; according as I loved you, that ye
  may love one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> By this all
  will know that ye (are) my disciples, if ye should love one another.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Peter said to him: Lord, whither art
  thou to go?' Jesus answered: The place to which I will go, it is not possible
  for thee to walk after me now (thither), but at (the) end thou shalt [walk].'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Peter said to him: Wherefore is it
  not possible for me to walk after thee now? I will lay (down) my life (lit.
  soul) for thee.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Jesus answered him:
  Wilt thou lay (down) thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say to thee, that a
  cock shall not crow until thou deniest me three times.</p>

  There are many mansions in (the) house of my Father: if there were not, I
  would have said (it) to you; because I will go and prepare a place for you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And if I should go and prepare a place
  for you, again I shall come, and take you away to me; that in (the) place in

  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And (to the) place to which I shall go, ye know
  the road.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Thomas said to him: `Lord,
  we know not whither thou art to go, and how is it possible for us to know the
  road?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Jesus said to him: am the road,
  and the truth, and the life; no one cometh to the Father, unless he come by
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> If ye know me, ye shall know my
  Father also; and henceforth ye know him, and ye saw him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Philip said to him: Lord, shew to us the Father,
  and it is sufficient for us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> 'Jesus

  me not, Philip? he who saw me, saw the Father; how sayest thou: "Shew to us
  the Father?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Believest thou not that
  I am in my Father, and my Father in me? these words which I say to you I was
  not speaking them by myself, but the Father who abideth in me, he doeth his
  works. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Believe me that I am in my
  Father, and my Father in me, otherwise even because of the works believe me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that he
  who believeth me, the works which I do, he shall do also; and greater than
  these shall he do, because I will go to the Father. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And that which ye will ask in my name, I shall do
  it for you, that the Father may be glorified in (the) Son. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> That which ye will ask in my name, this I will
  do. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> If ye love me, ye will keep my
  commandments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I will beseech the
  Father, and he shall give to you (a) Paraclete, that he may be with you for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The Spirit of the truth; whom
  it is not possible for the world to receive, because it seeth him not, nor
  knoweth him. But ye know him, because he abideth with you, and shall be in
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> I shall not leave you being
  orphans; I come to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Yet a little,
  and the world will no longer see me; but ye see me; because I am alive, [and]
  ye also shall live. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> In that day ye
  shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I also in you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> He who hath my commandments, and who
  keepeth them, that (one) loveth me; and him who loveth me my Father shall
  love, and I shall love him, and I shall manifest myself to him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Judas said to him, not (the) Iscariot: Lord, what
  happened that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not (to) the world?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Jesus answered, saying to him: He who
  loveth me shall keep my word, and my Father shall love him, and we shall come
  to him, and make our abode in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> He
  who loveth me not, will not keep my words; and the word which ye hear is not
  mine, but that of the Father who sent me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And these (things) I said to you, abiding with
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But if the Paraclete should
  come, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach
  you all things, and he will remind you of all things which I said to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> I will leave my peace to you, my own
  peace I will give to you; not as the world giveth, will I give. Let not your
  heart be troubled, nor be doubtful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span>
  Ye heard that I said to you, that I will go, and I come to you. If ye loved
  (imperf.) me, ye would rejoice, because I will go to the Father; because my
  Father is greater than I. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And now I
  said (it) to you before it happeneth, that if it should happen, ye may
  believe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> 1 will not say many words to
  you any longer, for (the) ruler of this world cometh; and he hath nothing in

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I am the true vine; and my Father
  is the husbandman. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> Every branch which
  is in me, which will not bring forth fruit he will cut away; and every one
  (lit. that) which will bring fruit, he will cleanse it, that it may bring
  forth more fruit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Now ye were cleansed
  because of this word which I spake to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Abide in me, and I also in you. According as the
  branch--it is not possible that it should bring forth fruit from itself,
  unless it abide in the vine: thus ye also--it is not possible for you, unless
  ye abide in me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> I am the vine; ye are
  the branches: he who will abide in me, and I also in him, this (one) shall
  bring forth much fruit: because without me it is not possible for you to do
  anything. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Unless any one abide in me,
  he will be cast out as the branch; and he is withered; and they gather them,
  and cast them to the fire; and they are burned. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And if ye should abide in me, and my words abide
  in you. ask that which ye wish, and it will be clone for you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In this is my Father glorified, that ye bring
  forth much fruit, and that ye be to me disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> As my Father loved me, I also loved you: abide in
  my love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> If ye keep my commandments,
  ye will abide in my love: as I also kept the commandments of my Father, and I
  abide in his love. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> These (things) I
  said to you, that my joy may abide in you; and that your joy also may be
  fulfilled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> This is my own
  commandment, that ye love one another, as I loved you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> No one hath greater than this love, that he (lit.
  one) should lay (down) his life (lit. soul) for his friend. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Ye are my friends, if ye should do the things
  which I order you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I will no longer
  call you "servant;" because the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but
  you I am to call "my friends;" because all things which I heard from my
  Father I shewed to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Ye chose not
  me, but I chose you; and I set you, that ye might go and bring forth fruit,
  and that your fruit might stay. That that which ye will ask from the Father
  in my name, he might give it to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span>
  And these (things) I order you, that ye love one another. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> If the world hate you, know that it first hated
  me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> If ye were from the world, the
  world would love that which is its own. But because ye are not from the
  world, but I chose you from the world, therefore the world hateth you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Remember the word which I spake to
  you , that there is not a servant who is greater than his lord. If they
  persecuted me, they shall persecute you also; if they kept my word, they
  shall keep yours also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But all these
  (things) they will do to you because of my name; because they know not him
  who sent me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> If I had not come and
  spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have not pretext
  concerning their sin. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> He who hateth
  me hateth my Father also. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> If I had
  not done the works among them which no other did, they had not had sin: but
  now they saw, and they hated me and my Father also. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But (this is) that the word might be fulfilled
  which is written in their law, that they hated me without a cause.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> If the Paraclete should come, whom I
  will send to you from my Father, the Spirit of the truth, who cometh from the
  Father, he will bear witness concerning me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And ye also bear witness, because ye are with me
  from (the) first.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john16">16</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> These (things) I said to you, that
  ye might not be offended, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> if they
  should put you out of the synagogue. But an hour cometh, that every one, who
  will kill you, shall (conj.) think that he offered sacrifice to God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And these (things) they shall do to
  you, because they knew not the Father, nor knew they me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But these (things) I said to you, that if the hour
  should come, ye may remember them that I have said them to you; and these
  (things) I said not to you from (the) beginning, because I was (imperf.) with
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> But now I will go to him who sent
  me, and no one of you asketh me, "Whither wilt thou go'?" <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But because I said these (things) to you, (the)
  grief filled your heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But (the)
  truth I say to you; it is profitable for you that I go. For unless I go, the
  Paraclete will not come to you. But if I should go, I will send him to you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And if that (one) should come, he
  shall convict the world concerning (the) sin, and concerning righteousness,
  and concerning judgement. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Concerning
  (the) sin indeed, because they believe me not; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and concerning righteousness, because I will go
  to the Father, and ye will see me no longer; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and concerning judgement, because (the) ruler of
  this World hath been judged. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> I have
  yet many things to say to you, but ye will not be able to bear them now.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Howbeit if that (one), the Spirit of
  the truth, should come, he shall guide you in all truth. For he is not to
  speak from himself, but the things which he is to hear he will speak; and the
  things which come, he shall show to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> That (one) will glorify me, because he is to take
  of that which is mine own, and will show to you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> All things which my Father hath are mine;
  therefore I said to you, that he is to take of that which is mine own, and
  shew to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Yet a little, (and) ye
  will not see me; and again, yet a little, (and) ye will see me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Some of his disciples said to one another: What
  is this word which he saith to us, that yet a little, (and) ye will not see
  me; and again, yet a little, (and) ye will see me; and, because I will go to
  the Father?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> They were saying then:
  'What is this which he saith, "Yet a little?" we know not what he said.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Jesus knew that they were wishing to
  ask him, and he said to them: 'Ye seek for this word with one another,
  because I said to you, that yet a little, (and) ye will not see me; and
  again, yet a little, (and) ye will see ine. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye will weep
  and mourn, but the world will rejoice; ye will be grieved, but your grief
  will become to you joy. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The woman if
  she should be going to bear is grieved, because her hour came: but if she
  should bear the son, she remembereth not the tribulation because of the joy,
  that she bare a man into the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span>
  And ye also now indeed shall have grief; again I will see you, and ye will
  rejoice; and your joy no one will take away from you. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And in that day ye will ask me not anything.
  Verily, verily, I say to you, that which ye will ask from the Father in my
  name, he shall give to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Till now
  ye asked not yet anything in my name: ask, and ye will receive, that your joy
  may be complete. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And these (things) I
  said to you in proverbs; and an hour cometh, when I will speak to you no
  longer in proverbs, but openly I will shew to you concerning the Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> In that day ye shall ask in my name,
  and I will not say to you, that I will beseech the Father concerning you.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> For the Father himself also loveth
  you, because ye loved me, and ye believed that I came from the Father.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> I came from the Father, and I came
  into the world; again I will leave the world, and I will go to the Father.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> His disciples said to him: Lo, now
  thou speakest openly, and thou sayest not any proverb. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Now we know, that thou knowest all things, and
  thou past not need for any one to ask thee; in this we believe, that thou
  camest from God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Jesus answered:
  'Now ye believe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> Lo, an hour cometh,
  and it came, that ye may be scattered, each one to his place, and may leave
  me alone, and I am not alone, because my Father is with me. <span style=

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> These (things) Jesus spake, and

  thee the one true God alone, and him whom thou sentest, Jesus Christ.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> I glorified thee upon the earth,
  having finished the work which thou gavest to me, that I might do it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And now glorify thou me, my Father,
  with (apud) thee in the glory which I had (imperf.) at first, before the
  world was, with thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> I manifested thy
  name to the men whom thou gavest to me from the world: thine they are, and
  thou gavest them to me, and they kept thy word. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And now they knew that all things which thou
  gavest to me are from thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Because
  the words which thou gavest to me, I gave to them; and they also received
  them, and they knew truly that I came from thee, and they believed that thou
  sentest me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I pray for them: I was not
  praying concerning the world, but concerning them whom thou gavest to me,
  because they are thine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And they who
  are mine are thine; and I was glorified in them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And I am no longer in the world; but these, they
  are in the world, and I come to thee. My Father, the holy (one), keep them in
  thy name which thou gavest to me, that they may be one as we are.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> When I was (lit. being) with them I
  was keeping them in thy name which thou gavest me. I kept them, and not any
  of them perished except (the) son of (the) perdition, that the scripture
  might be fulfilled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But now I am
  coming to thee, and these (things) I speak in the world, that my joy may be
  complete in them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I gave to them thy
  word, and the world hated them, because they are not from the world, as I
  also am not from the world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> I was not
  beseeching that thou shouldest take them away from the world, but that thou
  shouldest keep them from the evil. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span>
  They are not from the world, as I also am not from the world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Hallow them in the truth; thine own word is the

  be hallowed in truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And I was not
  beseeching concerning these alone, but besides for them who believe me
  through their word; <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> that they all may
  be one, according as, [the] Father, thou art in me, I also in thee; that they
  also may be in us one; that the world may believe that thou sentest me.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the glory which thou gavest to
  me, I gave to them, that they also may be one, as we also are one:

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Jesus having said these (things)
  came forth with his disciples across the torrent (lit. stray-water) of the
  cedar trees, the place in which there is a garden; into this entered Jesus
  and his disciples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Judas also, who
  was to deliver him (up), was knowing that place, because many times Jesus
  assembled thither with his disciples. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Judas then having received the multitude and officers from the chief priests
  and the Pharisees, came thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And Jesus knowing all things which
  come upon him, came forth, he said to them: For whom sought ye?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> They answered, they said to him: Jesus of
  Nazareth.' Jesus said to them: I am (he).' Judas, who was to deliver him up,
  was standing with them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> When then he
  said to them: I am (he),' they fled back, and they fell down. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Again he asked them: For whom sought ye?' And they
  said: Jesus of Nazareth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> 'Jesus
  answered: said to you, that I am (he); if ye sought for me, send these away,
  let them go; <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> that the word might be
  fulfilled which he said: Them whom thou gavest to me, I lost not any of
  them.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Simon Peter then having a
  sword drew it, and struck at (the) servant of the chief priest, and cut off
  his right ear; now (the) name of the servant is Malchos. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Jesus then said to Peter: Put (lit. throw) the
  sword into its sheath: the cup which my Father gave to me, shall (lit. will)
  I not drink it?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The multitude then
  and the Chiliarch and the officers of the Jews laid hold on Jesus, they bound
  him; <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> and they brought him first to
  Anna; for he was (the) father-in-law to Kaiapha, who was (imperf.) chief
  priest for that year. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Now it was this
  Kaiapha who counselled the Jews, saying, that it is profitable that one man
  should die for the people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And Simon
  Peter was walking after Jesus, and another disciple: now that disciple was
  (imperf.) known to the chief priest. And he came in with Jesus to the court
  of the chief priest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Peter was
  standing outside by the entrance. The disciple then, who was (imperf.) an
  acquaintance of (lit. to) the chief priest, came, he spake to the porteress,
  and he brought Peter in. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The
  porter-maid said to Peter: Art thou also one of (the) disciples of this man?'
  and he said: Nay.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Nov the servants
  and the officers were standing (by), having lit a fire for themselves,
  because it was (the) winter; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also
  was standing with them, warming himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> The chief priest, then asked Jesus concerning his
  disciples, and concerning his teaching. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Jesus answered him, saying: 'I spake to the world
  openly. And I was teaching in the synagogues always, and in the temple, the
  place to which all the Jews assemble. And I said not any word in secret.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Wherefore askest thou me? ask them
  who heard, what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Jesus having said these (things), one
  of the officers who stood (by) struck Jesus, saying: Is this (the) manner of
  answering the chief priest?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Jesus
  answered, he said to him: If evil I spake, bear witness of the evil: but if
  well, wherefore beatest thou me?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span>
  Then Anna sent him bound to Kaiapha the chief priest. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Now Simon Peter was standing, warming himself:
  they said to him: Art thou also one of his disciples?' and he denied, he
  said: Nay.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> One of the servants of
  the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said: Did I
  not see thee with him in the garden?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  Again Peter denied; and immediately a cock crew. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> They then brought Jesus from Kaiapha into the
  Prætorium; and it was early; and they themselves came not into the Prætorium,
  that they shall not be defiled, until they eat the passover. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Pilate then came forth to them, and said to them:
  What accusation bring ye against this man?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> They answered, they said to him: If this were not
  a wicked (man), we would not have delivered him to thee.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Pilate said to them: Take ye him, judge him
  according to your law.' The Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to kill
  any one:' <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> that the word of Jesus
  might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying with what death he will die.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Again Pilate came into the Prætorium,
  and he called Jesus, he said to him: Art thou (the) king of the Jews?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Jesus answered and said: Sayest thou
  this of thyself, or did others say (it) to thee concerning me?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Pilate answered, saying: Am I a Jew also? thine
  own nation and the chief priests, they delivered thee (up): what didst thou?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of
  the world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants (lit. officers)
  would have fought (lit. given) for me, that I should not be delivered to the
  Jews; but now my kingdom is not of the world.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Pilate then said: (Art) thou a king then?' Jesus
  answered: 'Thou sayest that I (am) a king. For I was born for this work, and
  therefore I came into the world for my bearing witness to the truth; all who
  are of the truth hear my voice.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span>
  Pilate said to him: What is the truth?' and having said this, again he came
  forth to the Jews, he said to them: I find not any guilt in this man.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> But your custom is that I should
  release one to you in the passover, wish ye then that I should release to you
  (the) king of the Jews?' <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And they all
  cried out, saying: Release not this (man); but release Barabbas.' Now this
  Barabbas was a robber.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john19">19</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Then Pilate took Jesus, he scourged
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the soldiers plaited a crown
  of thorns, they put (lit. gave) it upon his head, and they arrayed him in a
  purple garment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And they were coming
  to him, saying: king of the Jews ' and they were striking him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Again Pilate came, and said to them: Lo, I will
  bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find not any guilt in (lit. to)
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Then Jesus came out, wearing the
  thorn-crown and the purple garment, and Pilate said to them: Behold, the
  man!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> When then the chief priests and
  the officers saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.'
  Pilate said to them: 'Take him yourselves, crucify him, for I find not any
  guilt attaching (lit. taking) to him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to our law he is worthy
  of (the) death, because he made himself Son of God.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> When then Pilate heard this word, he feared the
  more. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he came into the Prætorium,
  he said to Jesus: 'Whence art thou?' ' But Jesus answered him not.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Pilate said to him: Wherefore
  speakest thou not to me? or knowest thou not that I have authority to crucify
  thee, I have authority again to release thee?' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Jesus answered: Thou hast not any authority over
  (lit. into) me, if it had not been given to thee from above; therefore he who
  gave me to thee hath greater sin.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Because of this (lit. therefore) then Pilate was seeking to (lit. for)
  release him. The Jews then cried out, saying: 'If thou shouldst release this
  (man), thou (art) not (the) friend of (the) king; for every one who maketh
  himself king, (is) opposing (the) king.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And Pilate having heard these words, brought
  Jesus forth, and he sat on the judgement-seat in the place which is called
  the Lithostrôton,' but in Hebrew Gabbatha.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Now it was (the) Preparation of the Passover, and
  it was (the) sixth hour. And Pilate was saying to the Jews: Behold, your
  king!' <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And they cried out: Take him
  away, take him away, crucify him.' Pilate said to them: Should I (conj.)
  crucify your king?' The chief priests answered: We have no king except
  Kesar.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then, therefore (lit. then),
  he delivered to them Jesus, that they might crucify him. They took then
  Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he carrying his cross,
  came to the place which is called the skull,' but in Hebrew Golgotha;'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> the place in which they crucified
  him: and they crucified two robbers also with him on this side and this side
  of him, and Jesus in (the) midst. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And
  Pilate wrote a title also, and set it upon the cross. And it was written:
  Jesus of Nazareth, (the) king of the Jews.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And many of the Jews read the title, because the
  place in which Jesus was crucified was (imperf.) near to the city. And it was
  written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The chief priests of the Jews were saying then to
  Pilate: Write not, "(The) king of the Jews," but that he said: "I am (the)
  king of the Jews." ' <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Pilate answered:
  That which I wrote I wrote.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> The
  soldiers then having crucified Jesus, took his garments, they made four
  portions, and the coat also: now the coat was seamless, woven from above all
  of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> They said then to one another:
  Let us not rend it, but let us cast lot for it, to which of us it is to
  belong.' That the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They divided my
  garments among them, and they cast lot for my raiment.' These (things) then
  the soldiers did. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> But there were
  standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and (the) sister of his mother,
  Mary of (lit. that of) Kleopa, and Mary the Magdalene. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And Jesus having seen his mother, and the
  disciple whom he was loving, standing (by), said to his mother: thy son!'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then he said to the disciple:
  'Behold, thy mother!' And from that hour the disciple took her away to his
  house. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> After these (things), Jesus
  having seen that now all things were finished, that the scripture might be
  finished, he said: thirst.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And there
  was a vessel full of vinegar set down; they filled a sponge with vinegar,
  they placed it upon hyssop, they put (lit. threw) it by his mouth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> When then Jesus tasted the vinegar,
  he said: 'It is finished:' and having bent down his head, he delivered (up)
  the spirit. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> The Jews then, since it
  was the Preparation, that the bodies might not stay upon the cross on (the)
  sabbath for great was the day of that sabbath--they besought Pilate, that
  they might break their legs, and take them away. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> The soldiers then came, and (of) the first indeed
  they brake his legs; and they brake those of the other who was crucified with
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> But having come to Jesus, they
  found him--he was already dead; they brake not his legs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But one of the soldiers pierced his side with his
  spear; and immediately came out water and blood. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And he who saw bare witness; and true is his
  witness; and he also, that (one), knoweth that he said truth, that ye might
  believe. <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> For these (things) happened,
  that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of his shall not be broken.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And again the scripture saith: They
  shall see him whom they pierced.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And
  after these (things) came Joseph the man of Arimatheas, he besought
  Pilate--being himself a disciple of Jesus; but he was (imperf.) in secret
  (lit. hid) because of (the) fear of the Jews--that he might take away the
  body of Jesus: and Pilate commanded to give it. He came then and took away
  the body of Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And there came
  also Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night at first, having a mixture (of)
  myrrh and aloe, about a hundred pound. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> They took then the body of Jesus, and wrapped it
  in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews for
  embalming. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Now there was a garden in
  the place in which he was crucified; and there was a new sepulchre in the
  garden: no one was ever yet put (lit. thrown) in (it). <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Since the sepulchre was (imperf.) near to them,
  because that it was the Preparation of the Jews, they laid Jesus in it.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john20">20</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Now on (the) first (lit. one of the
  sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene came to the sepulchre early, it being yet dusk
  [out], and she saw the stone taken away from the mouth of the sepulchre.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> She ran then, she came to Simon Peter,
  and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved (imperf.), and she said to them:
  They took away our Lord from the sepulchre, and we know not where they laid
  him.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Peter then came forth and the
  other disciple, and they were coming to the sepulchre. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And they were running both together. And the
  disciple ran before Peter, and came (lit. did) first before (lit. to) him to
  the sepulchre. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And he gazed in, he saw
  the garments laid down; however he entered not. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And there came also Simon, Peter walking after
  him, and he went on into the sepulchre, and he saw the garments laid down:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> and the napkin, which was (imperf.)
  upon his head, was (imperf.) not with the garments, but wrapped (up), laid
  apart alone. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then came in also the
  other disciple who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, he believed.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> For they had not yet known the
  scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The disciples went again to their place.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> But Mary was standing outside by the
  sepulchre weeping: and as she (was) weeping, she looked into the sepulchre:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> she saw two angels sitting in white
  vesture, one at the head, and one at the foot, in the place in which the body
  of Jesus was lying. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And those
  (angels) said to her: Woman, why weepest thou? ' She said to them: They took
  away my Lord, and I know not where they laid him.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Having said these (things), she turned herself
  back, she saw Jesus standing, and she was not knowing that it is Jesus.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Jesus said to her: Woman, wherefore
  weepest thou? for whom sought thou?' And she, thinking that it is the
  gardener, said to him: My Lord, if thou carriedst him (away), show to me
  where thou laidest him, and I will take him away.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Jesus said to her: Mariam:' and she turned
  herself, she said to him in Hebrew: 'Rabbouni,' which is this: 'Teacher.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Jesus said to her: Touch me not: for
  I went not yet up to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, that
  I will go up to my Father, who is your Father; and my God, who is your God.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And Mary the Magdalene came, she told
  (lit. shewed) to the disciples: I saw the Lord, and these (things) he said to
  me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And it was evening of that day,
  (the) first (lit. one) of the sabbaths, and the doors being shut of the place
  in which the disciples were assembled, because of (the) fear of the Jews,
  then (he) Jesus came, he stood in their midst, he said to them: (The) peace
  to you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And having said this, he
  shewed to them his hands and his side: the disciples then rejoiced having
  seen the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he said to them
  again: (The) peace to you; according as my Father sent me, I also send you.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And having said this, he breathed in
  their face, and said to them: 'Receive to you the (lit. a) Holy Spirit.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Whose sins ye will forgive [to them],
  they are forgiven to them; and them which ye will retain, they shall be
  retained.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> But Thomas who is called
  Didymus,' one of the twelve, was (imperf.) not there with them, Jesus having
  come to them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> The disciples then were
  saying to him We saw the Lord.' But he said to them: Unless I see (the) print
  of the nails in his hands, and put (lit. throw) my finger into (the) print of
  the nails, and put (lit. throw) my hand into his side, I will not believe.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And after eight days again the
  disciples were assembled within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came within,
  the doors being shut, and he stood in their midst, he said to them: (The)
  peace to you.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then he said to
  Thomas: 'Reach (lit. give) thy finger hither, and see my hands, and put forth
  thy hand, thrust (lit. throw) it into my side, and be not faithless.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Thomas answered and said: My Lord and
  my God.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Jesus said to him: Because
  thou sawest me, thou believedst: blessed are they who saw not, and believed.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Many other signs indeed Jesus did
  before his disciples, which are not written in this book. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(31)</span> But these were written, that ye may believe that
  Jesus Christ is (the) Son of God, and that, believing, eternal life may be to
  you in his name.</p>

  <h3 id="gospel_of_st._john21">21</h3>

  <p><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And after these (things) again
  Jesus manifested himself to his disciples at the sea of Tiberiados; and he
  manifested himself thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> There were
  (imperf.) at a place Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus,' and
  (the) sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Simon Peter said to them: I will go and catch
  fish.' They said to him: I We come also with thee;' and having come forth,
  they entered into the ship; and in that night they caught not any.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> But morning being about to come, Jesus
  stood on the shore; however the disciples knew not that it was (lit. is)
  Jesus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Jesus then said to them:
  Children, have ye anything to eat?"They answered: Nay.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> He said to them: Cast the net on the right of the
  ship, and ye shall find.' And they cast, and they could not draw it up for
  (the) abundance of the fishes. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The
  disciple whom Jesus loved (imperf.) said to Peter: It is the Lord.' Simon
  Peter then having heard that it was (lit. is) the Lord, girded himself in his
  clothing, for he was (imperf.) naked, and threw himself into the sea.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> But the other disciples came in the
  ship--for they were (imperf.) not distant from the shore, but about two
  hundred cubits--drawing the net of the fishes. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And when they came to the land, they looked, they
  saw a fire laid [down], and fish upon it, and bread. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Jesus said to them: Bring of the fishes which ye
  caught now.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Simon Peter then came
  up, and he drew the net up on the land, full of great fish, being a hundred
  (and) fifty-three in it; and though (lit. being) this number (was) in it, the
  net was not rent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Jesus said to them:
  Come, eat.' And there was (imperf.) not any of his disciples (who) dare ask
  him:: Who (art) thou?' knowing that it is the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Jesus then came, he took the bread and gave to
  them, and the fish thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And this is
  (the) third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, having risen
  from the dead. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> When then they (had)
  eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter:: `Simon, (son) of John, lovest thou me
  (more) than these?' He said to him: 'Yea, my Lord, thou knowest that I love
  thee.' He said to him: Feed my lambs.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Again he said to him (the) second time: Simon,
  (son) of John, lovest thou me?' He said to him: Yea, my Lord, thou knowest
  that I love thee.' He said to him: Feed my sheep.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> He said to him again (the) third time: Simon,
  (son) of John, lovest thou me?' Peter was grieved because he said to him
  (the) third time: Lovest thou me.' And he said to him: 'Lord, thou knowest
  all things, thou knowest that I love thee.' He said to him:' Feed my sheep.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Verily, verily, I say to thee that,
  thou being a child, thou girdest thyself, and goest whither thou wiliest; but
  if thou should be old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall
  gird thee, and they shall take thee away, whither thou willest not.'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Now having said this, he signified in
  what death he is to glorify God: and having said this, he said to him: Walk
  after me.' <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And Peter turned himself,
  he saw the disciple whom Jesus loved (imperf.), who reclined on his breast at
  (lit. in) the supper, who said to him: Lord, who will deliver thee (up)?'
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Peter then having seen this (man),
  said to Jesus: My Lord, and this (man) what (shall) he (do)? ' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Jesus said to him: If I should wish to leave him
  until I come, what (is it) to thee? but thou follow me.' <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And this word came forth among the brothers, that
  that disciple will not die, but Jesus said not to him, that he will not die;
  but if I should wish to leave him until I come, what is it to thee?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> This is the disciple who bare witness
  of these (things); and he wrote them; and we know that his witness is true.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And there are many other things again
  which Jesus did; these, if they had been written one by one, I know that the
  world would not be able to contain the books which would have been (lit. will
  be) written.</p>
