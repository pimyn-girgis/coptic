  <h3 id="danielA">A</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> There dwelt a
  man in Babylon, called Joacim: <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he
  took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair
  woman, and one that feared the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the
  law of Moses. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Now Joacim was a great
  rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted
  the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The same year were appointed two of the ancients
  of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came
  from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> These kept much at Joacim's house: and
  all that had any suits in law came unto them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna
  went into her husband's garden to walk. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the two elders saw her going in every day, and
  walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And they perverted their own mind, and turned away
  their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just
  judgments. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And albeit they both were
  wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that
  they desired to have to do with her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span>
  Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And the one said to the other, Let us now go
  home: for it is dinner time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> So when
  they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back
  again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another
  the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both
  together, when they might find her alone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she
  went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself
  in the garden: for it was hot. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And
  there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and
  watched her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> Then she said to her
  maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may
  wash me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they did as she bade
  them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to
  fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders,
  because they were hid. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Now when the
  maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> Behold, the garden doors are shut,
  that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto
  us, and lie with us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> If thou wilt
  not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and
  therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on
  every side: for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not I
  cannot escape your hands. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> It is
  better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the
  sight of the Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> With that Susanna
  cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then ran the one, and opened the
  garden door. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> So when the servants of
  the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy door, to
  see what was done unto her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> But when
  the elders had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for
  there was never such a report made of Susanna. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And it came to pass the next day, when the people
  were assembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full of
  mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the
  daughter of Chelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> So she came with her father and mother, her
  children, and all her kindred. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Now
  Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous to behold. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And these wicked men commanded to uncover her
  face, (for she was covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Therefore her friends and all that
  saw her wept. <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Then the two elders
  stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And she weeping looked up toward
  heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And the elders said, As we walked in the garden
  alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent
  the maids away. <span style="color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Then a young man, who
  there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> Then we that stood in a corner of the garden,
  seeing this wickedness, ran unto them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And when we saw them together, the man we could
  not hold: for he was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> But having taken this woman, we asked
  who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Then the assembly believed them as
  those that were the elders and judges of the people: so they condemned her to
  death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> Then Susanna cried out with a
  loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and
  knowest all things before they be: <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span>
  Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I
  must die; whereas I never did such things as these men have maliciously
  invented against me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And the Lord
  heard her voice. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Therefore when she
  was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young
  youth whose name was Daniel: <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Who
  cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(47)</span> Then all the people turned them
  toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast spoken?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(48)</span> So he standing in the midst of them
  said, Are ye such fools, ye sons of Israel, that without examination or
  knowledge of the truth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> Return again to the place of judgment: for they
  have borne false witness against her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(50)</span>
  Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him,
  Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the
  honour of an elder. <span style="color:#b00e23">(51)</span> Then said Daniel
  unto them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(52)</span> So when they were put asunder one
  from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen
  old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come
  to light. <span style="color:#b00e23">(53)</span> For thou hast pronounced
  false judgment and hast condemned the innocent and hast let the guilty go
  free; albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(54)</span> Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell
  me, Under what tree sawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under
  a mastick tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(55)</span> And Daniel said, Very
  well; thou hast lied against thine own head; for even now the angel of God
  hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(56)</span> So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the
  other, and said unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty
  hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(57)</span> Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel,
  and they for fear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not
  abide your wickedness. <span style="color:#b00e23">(58)</span> Now therefore
  tell me, Under what tree didst thou take them companying together? Who
  answered, Under an holm tree. <span style="color:#b00e23">(59)</span> Then
  said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine own head: for
  the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in two, that he may
  destroy you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(60)</span> With that all the
  assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them that
  trust in him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(61)</span> And they arose against
  the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own
  mouth: <span style="color:#b00e23">(62)</span> And according to the law of
  Moses they did unto them in such sort as they maliciously intended to do to
  their neighbour: and they put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was
  saved the same day. <span style="color:#b00e23">(63)</span> Therefore
  Chelcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joacim her
  husband, and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(64)</span> From that day forth was Daniel had in
  great reputation in the sight of the people.
  <h3 id="daniel1">1</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the third
  year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon
  to Jerusalem, and besieged it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And the
  Lord gave into his hand Joakim king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the
  house of God: and he brought them into the land of Sennaar to the house of
  his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the king told Asphanez his chief
  eunuch, to bring in some of the captive children of Israel, and of the seed
  of the kingdom, and of the princes; <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  young men in whom was no blemish, and beautiful in appearance, and skilled in
  all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and acquainted with prudence, and who
  had ability to stand in the house before the king, and the king gave
  commandment to teach them the learning and language of the Chaldeans.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the king appointed them a daily
  portion from the king’s table, and from the wine which he drank; and gave
  orders to nourish them three years, and that afterwards they should stand
  before the king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Now these were among
  them of the children of Juda, Daniel, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the chief of the eunuchs gave them
  names: to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach;
  and to Azarias, Abdenago. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And Daniel
  purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the king’s
  table, nor with the wine of his drink: and he intreated the chief of the
  eunuchs that he might not defile himself. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and
  compassion with the chief of the eunuchs. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I
  fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink, lest he
  see your countenances gloomy in comparison of the young men your equals; also
  shall ye endanger my head to the king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the chief of the
  eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Prove now thy servants ten days; and let them
  give us pulse, and let us eat, and let us drink water: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And let our countenances be seen by thee, and the
  countenances of the children that eat at the king’s table; and deal with thy
  servants according as thou shalt see. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span>
  And he hearkened to them, and proved them ten days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And at the end of the ten days their countenances
  appeared fairer and stouter in flesh, than the children that fed at the
  king’s table. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> So Amelsad took away
  their supper and the wine of their drink, and gave them pulse. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And as for these four children, God gave them
  understanding and prudence in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had
  understanding in all visions and dreams. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And at the end of the days, after which the king
  had given orders to bring them in, then the chief of the eunuchs brought them
  in before Nabuchodonosor. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And the
  king spoke with them; and there were not found out of them all any like
  Daniel, and Ananias and Misael, and Azarias: and they stood before the king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And in every matter of wisdom and
  knowledge wherein the king questioned them, he found them ten times wiser
  than all the enchanters and sorcerers that were in all his kingdom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Daniel continued till the first
  year of king Cyrus.
  <h3 id="daniel2">2</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the second
  year of his reign Nabuchodonosor dreamed a dream, and his spirit was amazed,
  and his sleep departed from him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And
  the king gave orders to call the enchanters, and the magicians, and the
  sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they
  came and stood before the king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  the king said to them, I have dreamed, and my spirit was troubled to know the
  dream. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And the Chaldeans spoke to the
  king in the Syrian language, saying, O king, live for ever: do thou tell the
  dream to thy servants, and we will declare the interpretation. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing has
  departed from me: if ye do not make known to me the dream and the
  interpretation, ye shall be destroyed, and your houses shall be spoiled.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> But if ye make known to me the dream,
  and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and presents and
  much honour: only tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> They answered the second time, and
  said, Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the
  interpretation. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the king answered
  and said, I verily know that ye are trying to gain time, because ye see that
  the thing has gone from me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> If then ye
  do not tell me the dream, I know that ye have concerted to utter before me a
  false and corrupt tale, until the time shall have past: tell me my dream, and
  I shall know that ye will also declare to me the interpretation thereof.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The Chaldeans answered before the
  king, and said, There is no man upon the earth, who shall be able to make
  known the king’s matter: forasmuch as no great king or ruler asks such a
  question of an enchanter, magician, or Chaldean. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> For the question which the king asks is
  difficult, and there is no one else who shall answer it before the king, but
  the gods, whose dwelling is not with any flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Then the king in rage and anger commanded to
  destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span>
  So the decree went forth, and they began to slay the wise men; and they
  sought Daniel and his fellows to slay them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to
  Arioch the captain of the royal guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise
  men of Babylon; saying, <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Chief
  magistrate of the king, wherefore has the preemptory command proceeded from
  the king? So Arioch made known the matter to Daniel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And Daniel intreated the king to give him time,
  and that he might thus declare to the king the interpretation of it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> So Daniel went into his house, and
  made known the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his friends.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And they sought mercies from the God
  of heaven concerning this mystery; that Daniel and his friends might not
  perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a
  vision of the night; and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> May the name of God be blessed from
  everlasting and to everlasting: for wisdom and understanding are his.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he changes times and seasons: he
  appoints kings, and removes them, giving wisdom to the wise, and prudence to
  them that have understanding: <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> he
  reveals deep and secret matters; knowing what is in darkness, and the light
  is with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> I give thanks to thee,
  and praise thee, O God of my fathers, for thou has given me wisdom and power,
  and has made known to me the things which we asked of thee; and thou has made
  known to me the king’s vision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  Daniel came to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of
  Babylon, and said to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon, but bring me
  in before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then Arioch in haste brought in
  Daniel before the king, and said to him, I have found a man of the children
  of the captivity of Judea, who will declare the interpretation to the king.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the king answered and said to
  Daniel, whose name was Baltasar, Canst thou declare to me the dream which I
  saw, and the interpretation thereof? <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span>
  And Daniel answered before the king, and said, The mystery which the king
  asks the explanation of is not in the power of the wise men, magicians,
  enchanters, or soothsayers to declare to the king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> But there is a God in heaven revealing mysteries,
  and he has made known to king Nabuchodonosor what things must come to pass in
  the last days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are as
  follows, <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> O king: thy thoughts upon
  thy bed arose as to what must come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals
  mysteries has made known to thee what must come to pass. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Moreover, this mystery has not been revealed to
  me by reason of wisdom which is in me beyond all others living, but for the
  sake of making known the interpretation to the king, that thou mightest know
  the thoughts of thine heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Thou, O
  king, sawest, and behold an image: that image was great, and the appearance
  of it excellent, standing before thy face; and the form of it was terrible.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> It was an image, the head of which
  was of fine gold, its hands and breast and arms of silver, its belly and
  thighs of brass, <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> its legs of iron,
  its feet, part of iron and part of earthenware. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Thou sawest until a stone was cut out of a
  mountain without hands, and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and
  earthenware, and utterly reduced them to powder. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(35)</span> Then once for all the earthenware, the iron, the
  brass, the silver, the gold, were ground to powder, and became as chaff from
  the summer threshingfloor; and the violence of the wind carried them away,
  and no place was found for them: and the stone which had smitten the image
  became a great mountain, and filled all the earth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(36)</span> This is the dream; and we will tell the
  interpretation thereof before the king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the
  God of heaven has given a powerful and strong and honourable kingdom,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> in every place where the children of
  men dwell: and he has given into thine hand the wild beasts of the field, and
  the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and he has made thee lord of
  all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> Thou art the head of gold. And
  after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, an a third kingdom
  which is the brass, which shall have dominion over all the earth;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> and a fourth kingdom, which shall be
  strong as iron: as iron beats to powder and subdues all things, so shall it
  beat to powder and subdue. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> And
  whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes, part of earthenware and part of
  iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet there shall be in it of the strength
  of iron, as thou sawest the iron mixed with earthenware. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And whereas the toes of the feet were part of
  iron and part of earthenware, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part
  of it shall be broken. <span style="color:#b00e23">(43)</span> Whereas thou
  sawest the iron mixed with earthenware, they shall be mingled with the seed
  of men: but they shall not cleave together, as the iron does not mix itself
  with earthenware. <span style="color:#b00e23">(44)</span> And in the days of
  those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be
  destroyed: and his kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall
  beat to pieces and grind to powder all other kingdoms, and it shall stand for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> Whereas thou sawest that a
  stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it beat to pieces the
  earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the great God has
  made known to the king what must happen hereafter: and the dream is true, and
  the interpretation thereof sure. <span style="color:#b00e23">(46)</span> Then
  king Nabuchodonosor fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and gave
  orders to offer to him gifts and incense. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(47)</span> And the king answered and said to Daniel, Of a
  truth your God is a God of gods, and Lord of kings, who reveals mysteries;
  for thou has been able to reveal this mystery. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(48)</span> And the king promoted Daniel, and gave him great
  and abundant gifts, and set him over the whole province of Babylon, and made
  him chief satrap over all the wise men of Babylon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(49)</span> And Daniel asked of the king, and he appointed
  Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the affairs of the province of Babylon:
  but Daniel was in the king’s palace.
  <h3 id="daniel3">3</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In his
  eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor the king made a golden image, its height was
  sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits: and he set it up in the plain of Deira,
  in the province of Babylon. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And he
  sent forth to gather the governors, and the captains, and the heads of
  provinces, chiefs, and princes, and those who were in authority, and all the
  rulers of districts, to come to the dedication of the image. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> So the heads of provinces, the governors, the
  captains, the chiefs, the great princes, those who were in authority, and all
  the rulers of districts, were gathered to the dedication of the image which
  king Nabuchodonosor had set up; and they stood before the image. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded,
  ye peoples, tribes, and languages, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> at
  what hour ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and
  sackbut, and psaltery, and every kind of music, ye shall fall down and
  worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And whosoever shall not fall down and worship, in
  the same hour he shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And it came to pass when the nations heard the
  sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and all
  kinds of music, all the nations, tribes, and languages, fell down and
  worshipped the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. 8) Then
  came near certain Chaldeans, and accused the Jews to the king, saying,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> O king, live for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Thou, O king, has made a decree that every man
  who shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, sackbut, and
  psaltery, and all kinds of music, <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> and
  shall not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the
  burning fiery furnace. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> There are
  certain Jews whom thou has appointed over the affairs of the province of
  Babylon, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who have not obeyed thy decree, O
  king: they serve not thy gods, and worship not the golden image which thou
  hast set up. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then Nabuchodonosor in
  wrath and anger commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and they
  were brought before the king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And
  Nabuchodonosor answered and said to them, Is it true, Sedrach, Misach, and
  Abdenago, that ye serve not my gods, and worship not the golden image which I
  have set up? <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Now then if ye be ready,
  whensoever ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and
  sackbut, and psaltery, and harmony, and every kind of music, to fall down and
  worship the golden image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, in
  the same hour ye shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace; and who is the
  God that shall deliver you out of my hand? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then answered Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago and
  said to king Nabuchodonosor, We have no need to answer thee concerning this
  matter. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> For our God whom we serve is
  in the heavens, able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he
  will rescue us from thy hands, O king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we
  will not serve thy gods, nor worship the image which thou hast set up.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then Nabuchodonosor was filled with
  wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed toward Sedrach, Misach,
  and Abdenago: and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than
  usual, until it should burn to the uttermost. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he commanded mighty men to bind Sedrach,
  Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> Then those men were bound with their
  coats, and caps, and hose, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery
  furnace, <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> forasmuch as the king’s word
  prevailed; and the furnace was made exceeding hot. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Then these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and
  Abdenago, fell bound into the midst of the burning furnace, and walked in the
  midst of the flame, singing praise to God, and blessing the Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:1)</span> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on
  this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:2)</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our
  fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:3)</span> For thou art righteous in all the
  things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are
  right, and all thy judgments truth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:4)</span>
  In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of
  our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according
  to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of
  our sins. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:5)</span> For we have sinned and
  committed iniquity, departing from thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:6)</span> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed
  thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that
  it might go well with us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:7)</span> Wherefore
  all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to
  us, thou hast done in true judgment. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:8)</span>
  And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful
  forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the
  world. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:9)</span> And now we cannot open our
  mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that
  worship thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:10)</span> Yet deliver us not up
  wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:11)</span> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for
  thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Isaac’s sake, and for thy holy
  Israel’s sake; <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:12)</span> To whom thou hast
  spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of
  heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:13)</span> For we, O Lord, are become less than any
  nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:14)</span> Neither is there at this time
  prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation,
  or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:15)</span> Nevertheless in a contrite heart
  and an humble spirit let us be accepted. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:16)</span> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and
  bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be
  in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they
  shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:17)</span> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we
  fear thee, and seek thy face. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:18)</span> Put
  us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to
  the multitude of thy mercies. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:19)</span>
  Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy
  name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:20)</span> And let them be confounded in all
  their power and might, and let their strength be broken; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:21)</span> And let them know that thou art God, the only
  God, and glorious over the whole world. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:22)</span> And the king’s servants, that put them in,
  ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:23)</span> So that the flame streamed forth
  above the furnace forty and nine cubits. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:24)</span> And it passed through, and burned those
  Chaldeans it found about the furnace. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:25)</span> But the angel of the Lord came down into the
  oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire
  out of the oven; <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:26)</span> And made the midst
  of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire
  touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:27)</span> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised,
  glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:28)</span> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers:
  and to be praised and exalted above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:29)</span> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and
  to be praised and exalted above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:30)</span> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy
  glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:31)</span> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and
  sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:32)</span> Blessed art thou on the glorious
  throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:33)</span> Blessed art thou in the firmament
  of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:34)</span> O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:
  praise and exalt him above all for ever, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:35)</span> O ye heavens, bless ye the Lord: praise and
  exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:36)</span> O ye
  angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for

  the heaven, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:38)</span> O all ye powers of the Lord, bless

  "color:#b00e23">(B:39)</span> O ye sun and moon, bless ye the Lord: praise
  and exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:40)</span> O
  ye stars of heaven, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for

  ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=

  exalt him above all for ever, <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:43)</span> O ye
  fire and heat, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:44)</span> O ye winter and summer, bless ye
  the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:45)</span> O ye dews and storms of snow, bless ye the
  Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:46)</span> O ye nights and days, bless ye the Lord: bless
  and exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:47)</span> O
  ye light and darkness, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:48)</span> O ye ice and cold, bless ye
  the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:49)</span> O ye frost and snow, bless ye the Lord: praise
  and exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:50)</span> O
  ye lightnings and clouds, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all
  for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:51)</span> O let the earth bless the
  Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:52)</span> O ye mountains and little hills, bless ye the
  Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:53)</span> O all ye things that grow in the earth, bless
  ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:54)</span> O ye mountains, bless ye the Lord: Praise and
  exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:55)</span> O ye
  seas and rivers, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:56)</span> O ye whales, and all that move in
  the waters, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:57)</span> O all ye fowls of the air, bless ye
  the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:58)</span> O all ye beasts and cattle, bless ye the Lord:
  praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:59)</span> O ye children of men, bless ye the Lord: praise
  and exalt him above all for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:60)</span> O
  Israel, bless ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:61)</span> O ye priests of the Lord, bless ye
  the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:62)</span> O ye servants of the Lord, bless ye the Lord:
  praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:63)</span> O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless
  ye the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:64)</span> O ye holy and humble men of heart, bless ye the
  Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(B:65)</span> O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the
  Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever: for he hath delivered us from
  hell, and saved us from the hand of death, and delivered us out of the midst
  of the furnace and burning flame: even out of the midst of the fire hath he
  delivered us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:66)</span> O give thanks unto
  the Lord, because he is gracious: for his mercy endureth for ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(B:67)</span> O all ye that worship the Lord,
  bless the God of gods, praise him, and give him thanks: for his mercy
  endureth for ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And Nabuchodonosor
  heard them singing praises; and he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said
  to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?
  and they said to the king, Yes, O king. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the king said, But I see four men loose, and
  walking in the midst of the fire, and there has no harm happened to them; and
  the appearance of the fourth is like the Son of God. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then Nabuchodonosor drew near to the door of the
  burning fiery furnace, and said, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants
  of the most high God, proceed forth, and come hither. So Sedrach, Misach, and
  Abdenago, came forth out of the midst of the fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then were assembled the satraps, and captains,
  and heads of provinces, and the royal princes; and they saw the men, and
  perceived that the fire had not had power against their bodies, and the hair
  of their head was not burnt, and their coats were not scorched, nor was the
  smell of fire upon them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And king
  Nabuchodonosor answered and said, Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach, and
  Abdenago, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they
  trusted in him; and they have changed the king’s word, and delivered their
  bodies to be burnt, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except
  their own God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Wherefore I publish a
  decree: Every people, tribe, or language, that shall speak reproachfully
  against the God of Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago shall be destroyed, and
  their houses shall be plundered: because there is no other God who shall be
  able to deliver thus. <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Then the king
  promoted Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon, and
  advanced them, and gave them authority to rule over all the Jews who were in
  his kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> King Nabuchodonosor to
  all nations, tribes, and tongues, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be
  multiplied to you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> It seemed good to
  me to declare to you the signs and wonders which the most high God has
  wrought with me, <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> how great and mighty
  they are: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his power to all
  generations.
  <h3 id="daniel4">4</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> I
  Nabuchodonosor was thriving in my house, and prospering. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I saw a vision, and it terrified me, and I was
  troubled on my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I made a decree to bring in before me all the
  wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of
  the dream. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> So the enchanters,
  magicians, soothsayers, and Chaldeans came in: and I told the dream before
  them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> until Daniel came, whose name is
  Baltasar, according to the name of my God, who has within him the Holy Spirit
  of God; to whom I said, <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> O Baltasar,
  chief of the enchanters, of whom I know that the Holy Spirit of God is in
  thee, and no mystery is too hard for thee, hear the vision of my dream which
  I had, and tell me the interpretation of it. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> I had a vision upon my bed; and behold a tree in
  the midst of the earth, and its height was great. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> The tree grew large and strong, and its height
  reached to the sky, and its extent to the extremity of the whole earth:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> its leaves were fair, and its fruit
  abundant, and in it was meat for all; and under it the wild beasts of the
  field took shelter, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it,
  and all flesh was fed of it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> I beheld
  in the night vision upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came
  down from heaven and cried aloud, and thus he said, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Cut down the tree, and pluck off its branches,
  and shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the wild beasts be
  removed from under it, and the birds from its branches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Only leave the stump of its roots in the earth,
  and bind it with an iron and brass band; and it shall lie in the grass that
  is without and in the dew of heaven, and its portion shall be with the wild
  beasts in the grass of the field. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> His
  heart shall be changed from that of man, and the heart of a wild beast shall
  be given to him; and seven times shall pass over him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The matter is by the decree of the watcher, and
  the demand is a word of the holy ones; that the living may known that the
  Lord is most high over the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever
  he shall please, and will set up over it that which is set at nought of men.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> This is the vision which I king
  Nabuchodonosor saw: and do thou, Baltasar, declare the interpretation, for
  none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to shew me the interpretation of
  it: but thou, Daniel, art able; for the Holy Spirit of God is in thee.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then Daniel, whose name is Baltasar,
  was amazed about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And Baltasar
  answered and said, My lord, let the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
  interpretation of it to thine enemies. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The tree which thou sawest, that grew large and
  strong, whose height reached to the sky and its extent to all the earth;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> and whose leaves were flourishing,
  and its fruit abundant, (and it was meat for all; under it the wild beasts
  lodged, and the birds of the sky took shelter in its branches:) <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> is thyself, O king; for thou art grown great and
  powerful, and thy greatness has increased and reached to heaven, and thy
  dominion to the ends of the earth. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven,
  and he said, Strip the tree, and destroy it; only leave the stump of its
  roots in the ground, and bind it with a band of iron and brass; and it shall
  lie in the grass that is without, and in the dew of heaven, and its portion
  shall be with wild beasts, until seven times have passed over it;
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> this is the interpretation of it, O
  king, and it is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the
  king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And they shall drive thee forth
  from men, and thy dwelling shall be with wild beasts, and they shall feed
  thee with grass as an ox, and thou shall have thy lodging under the dew of
  heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou known that the Most
  High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whom he shall please.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And whereas they said, Leave the
  stumps of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom abides sure to thee from the
  time that thou shalt know the power of the heavens. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee,
  and atone for thy sins by alms, and thine iniquities by compassion on the
  poor: it may be God will be long-suffering to thy trespasses. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> After a twelvemonth, as he walked in
  his palace in Babylon, <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> the king
  answered and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal
  residence, by the might of my power, for the honour of my glory? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, there
  came a voice from heaven, saying, To thee, king Nabuchodonosor, they say, The
  kingdom has departed from thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> And
  they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the wild
  beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass as an ox: and seven
  times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High is Lord of the
  kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> In the same hour the word was
  fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor: and he was driven forth from men, and he ate
  grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his
  hairs were grown like lions’ hairs, and his nails as birds’ claws.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And at the end of the time I
  Nabuchodonosor lifted up mine eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me,
  and I blessed the Most High, and praised him that lives for ever, and gave
  him glory; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom lasts
  to all generations: <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> and all the
  inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his
  will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and there
  is none who shall withstand his power, and say to him, What has thou done?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> At the same time my reason returned
  to me, and I came to the honour of my kingdom; and my natural form returned
  to me, and my princes, and my nobles, sought me, and I was established in my
  kingdom, and more abundant majesty was added to me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> Now therefore I Nabuchodonosor praise and greatly
  exalt and glorify the King of heaven; for all his works are true, and his
  paths are judgment: and all that walk in pride he is able to abase.
  <h3 id="daniel5">5</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> Baltasar the
  king made a great supper for his thousand nobles, and there was wine before
  the thousand. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Baltasar drinking
  gave orders as he tasted the wine that they should bring the gold and silver
  vessels, which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought forth from the temple in
  Jerusalem; that the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his
  concubines, should drink out of them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  So the gold and silver vessels were brought which Nabuchodonosor had taken
  out of the temple of God in Jerusalem; and the king, and his nobles, and his
  mistresses, and his concubines, drank out of them. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and
  of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s
  hand, and wrote in front of the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s
  house: and the king saw the knuckles of the hand that wrote. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then the king’s countenance changed, and his
  thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees
  smote one another. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And the king cried
  aloud to bring in the magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; and he said to
  the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known to
  me the interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and there shall be a
  golden chain upon his neck, and he shall be the third ruler in my kingdom.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Then came in all the king’s wise men:
  but they could not read the writing, nor make known the interpretation to the
  king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And king Baltasar was troubled,
  and his countenance changed upon him, and his nobles were troubled with him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Then the queen came into the banquet
  house, and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee,
  and let not thy countenance be changed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the
  Spirit of God; and in the days of thy father watchfulness and understanding
  were found in him; and king Nabuchodonosor thy father made him chief of the
  enchanters, magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> For there is an excellent spirit in him, and
  sense and understanding in him, interpreting dreams as he does, and answering
  hard questions, and solving difficulties: it is Daniel, and the king gave him
  the name of Baltasar: now then let him be called, and he shall tell thee the
  interpretation of the writing. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then
  Daniel was brought in before the king: and the king said to Daniel, Art thou
  Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judea, which the king my father
  brought? <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> I have heard concerning
  thee, that the Spirit of God is in thee, and that watchfulness and
  understanding and excellent wisdom have been found in thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And now, the wise men, magicians, and
  soothsayers, have come in before me, to read the writing, and make known to
  me the interpretation: but they could not tell it me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I have heard concerning thee, that thou art
  able to make interpretations: now then if thou shalt be able to read the
  writing, and to make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be
  clothed with purple, and there shall be a golden chain upon thy neck, and
  thou shalt be third ruler in my kingdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And Daniel said, before the king, Let thy gifts
  be to thyself, and give the present of thine house to another; but I will
  read the writing, and will make known to thee the interpretation of it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> O king, the most high God gave to thy
  father Nabuchodonosor a kingdom, and majesty, and honour, and glory:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and by reason of the majesty which he
  gave to him, all nations, tribes, and languages trembled and feared before
  him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he smote; and whom he would he
  exalted; and whom he would he abased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was emboldened to act
  proudly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his honour was taken from
  him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And he was driven forth from
  men; and his heart was given him after the nature of wild beasts, and his
  dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him with grass as an ox, and
  his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the most high
  God is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whomsoever he shall
  please. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And thou accordingly, his
  son, O Baltasar, has not humbled thine heart before God: knowest thou not all
  this? <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And thou has been exalted
  against the Lord God of heaven; and they have brought before thee the vessels
  of his house, and thou, and thy nobles, and thy mistresses, and thy
  concubines, have drunk wine out of them; and thou has praised the gods of
  gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and wood, and stone, which see not,
  and which hear not, and know not: and the God in whose hand are thy breath,
  and all thy ways has thou not glorified. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Therefore from his presence has been sent forth
  the knuckle of a hand; and he has ordered the writing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And this is the ordered writing, Mane, Thekel,
  Phares. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> This is the interpretation of
  the sentence: Mane; God has measured thy kingdom, and finished it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Thekel; it has been weighed in the
  balance, and found wanting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Phares;
  thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> Then Baltasar commanded, and they clothed Daniel
  with scarlet, and put the golden chain about his neck, and proclaimed
  concerning him that he was the third ruler in the kingdom. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(30)</span> In the same night was Baltasar the Chaldean king
  slain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And Darius the Mede succeeded
  to the kingdom, being sixty-two years old.
  <h3 id="daniel6">6</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And it pleased
  Darius, and he set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be in
  all his kingdom; <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> and over them three
  governors, of whom one was, Daniel; for the satraps to give account to them,
  that the king should not be troubled. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span>
  And Daniel was over them, for there was an excellent spirit in him; and the
  king set him over all his kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  Then the governors and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel; but
  they found against him no occasion, nor trespass, nor error, because he was
  faithful. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the governors said, We
  shall not find occasion against Daniel, except in the ordinances of his God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then the governors and satraps stood
  by the king, and said to him, King Darius, live for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(7)</span> All who preside over thy kingdom, captains and
  satraps, chiefs and local governors, have taken counsel together, to
  establish by a royal statue and to confirm a decree, that whosoever shall ask
  a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be
  cast into the den of lions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Now then,
  O king, establish the decree, and publish a writ, that the decree of the
  Persians and Medes be not changed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  Then king Darius commanded the decree to be written. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And when Daniel knew that the decree was ordered,
  he went into his house; and his windows were opened in his chambers toward
  Jerusalem, and three times in the day he knelt upon his knees, and prayed and
  gave thanks before his God, as he used to do before. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Then these men watched, and found Daniel praying
  and supplicating to his God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And they
  came and said to the king, O king, has thou not made a decree, that
  whatsoever man shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, but of
  thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? And the king said, The
  word is true, and the decree of the Medes and Persians shall not pass.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> Then they answered and said before
  the king, Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judea, has not submitted
  to thy decree; and three times in the day he makes his requests of his God.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> Then the king, when he heard the
  saying, was much grieved for Daniel and he greatly exerted himself for Daniel
  to deliver him: and he exerted himself till evening to deliver him.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Then those men said to the king,
  Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is that we must not
  change any decree of statue which the king shall make. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel,
  and cast him into the den of lions. But the king said to Daniel, Thy God whom
  thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And they brought a stone, and put it on the mouth
  of the den; and the king sealed it with his ring, and with the ring of his
  nobles; that the case might not be altered with regard to Daniel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And the king departed to his house,
  and lay down fasting, and they brought him no food; and his sleep departed
  from him. But God shut the mouths of the lions, and they not molest Daniel.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then the king arose very early in the
  morning, and came in hast to the den of lions. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And when he drew near to the den, he cried with a
  loud voice, Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest
  continually, been able to deliver thee from the lion’s mouth? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And Daniel said to the king, O king, live for
  ever. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> My God has sent his angel, and
  stopped the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me: for uprightness was
  found in me before him; and moreover before thee, O king, I have committed no
  trespass. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Then the king was very glad
  for him, and he commanded to bring Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was
  brought out of the den, and there was found no hurt upon him, because he
  believed in his God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And the king
  commanded, and they brought the men that had accused Daniel, and they were
  cast into the den of lions, they, and their children, and their wives: and
  they reached not the bottom of the den before the lions had the mastery of
  them, and utterly broke to pieces all their bones. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then king Darius wrote to all nations, tribes,
  and languages, who dwell in all the earth, saying, Peace be multiplied to
  you. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> This decree has been set forth
  by me in every dominion of my kingdom, that men tremble and fear before the
  God of Daniel: for he is the living and eternal God, and his kingdom shall
  not be destroyed, and his dominion is for ever. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> He helps and delivers, and works signs and
  wonders in the heaven and on the earth, who has rescued Daniel from the power
  of the lions. <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And Daniel prospered in
  the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
  <h3 id="daniel7">7</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the first
  year of Baltasar, king of the Chaldeans Daniel had a dream, and visions of
  his head upon his bed: and he wrote his dream. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I Daniel beheld, and, lo, the four winds of heaven
  blew violently upon the great sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And
  there came up four great beasts out of the sea, differing from one another.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The first was as a lioness, and her
  wings as an eagle’s; I beheld until her wings were plucked, ands she was
  lifted off from the earth, and she stood on human feet, and a man’s heart was
  given to her. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And, behold, a second
  beast like a bear, and it supported itself on one side, and there were three
  ribs in its mouth, between its teeth: and thus they said to it, Arise, devour
  much flesh. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> After this one I looked,
  and behold another wild beast as a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird
  upon it: and the wild beast had four heads, and power was given to it.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> After this one I looked, and behold a
  fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and its teeth
  were of iron; devouring and crushing to atoms, and it trampled the remainder
  with its feet: and it was altogether different from the beasts that were
  before it; and it had ten hours. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> I
  noticed his horns, and behold, another little horn came up in the midst of
  them, and before it three of the former horns were rooted out: and, behold,
  there were eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I beheld until the thrones
  were set, and the Ancient of days sat; and his raiment was white as snow, and
  the hair of his head, as pure wool: his throne was a flame of fire, and his
  wheels burning fire. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> A stream of fire
  rushed forth before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten
  thousands of myriads, attended upon him: the judgment sat, and the books were
  opened. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> I beheld then because of the
  voice of the great words which that horn spoke, until the wild beast was
  slain and destroyed, and his body given to be burnt with fire. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And the dominion of the rest of the wild beasts
  was taken away; but a prolonging of life was given them for certain times.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> I beheld in the night vision, and,
  lo, one coming with the clouds of heaven as the Son of man, and he came on to
  the Ancient of days, and was brought near to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And to him was given the dominion, and the
  honour, and the kingdom; and all nations, tribes, and languages, shall serve
  him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and
  his kingdom shall not be destroyed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span>
  As for me Daniel, my spirit in my body trembled, and the visions of my head
  troubled me. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I drew near to one
  of them that stood by, and I sought to learn of him the truth of all these
  things: and he told me the truth, and made known to me the interpretation of
  the things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> These four beasts are
  four kingdoms that shall rise up on the earth: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> which shall be taken away; and the saints of the
  Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess it for ever and ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then I enquired carefully concerning
  the fourth beast; for it differed from every other beast, exceeding dreadful:
  its teeth were of iron, and its claws of brass, devouring, and utterly
  breaking to pieces, and it trampled the remainder with its feet: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> and concerning it ten horns that were in its
  head, and the other that came up, and rooted up some of the former, which had
  eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and his look was bolder than the
  rest. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> I beheld, and that horn made
  war with the saints, and prevailed against them; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> until the Ancient of days came, and he gave
  judgment to the saints of the Most High; and the time came on, and the saints
  possessed the kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And he said,
  The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on the earth, which shall excel
  all other kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and trample and destroy
  it. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And his ten horns are ten kings
  that shall arise: and after them shall arise another, who shall exceed all
  the former ones in wickedness and he shall subdue three kings. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And he shall speak words against the Most High,
  and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change
  times and law: and power shall be given into his hand for a time and times
  and half a time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the judgment has
  sat, and they shall remove his dominion to abolish it, and to destroy it
  utterly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And the kingdom and the
  power and the greatness of the kings that are under the whole heaven were
  given to the saints of the Most High; and his kingdom is an everlasting
  kingdom, and all powers shall serve and obey him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me
  Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance was changed: but
  I kept the matter in my heart.
  <h3 id="daniel8">8</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the third
  year of the reign of king Baltasar a vision appeared to me, even to me
  Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And I was in Susa the palace, which is in the land
  of Ælam, and I was on the bank of Ubal. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a
  ram standing in front of the Ubal; and he had high horns; and one was higher
  than the other, and the high one came up last. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I saw the ram butting westward, and northward,
  and southward; and no beast could stand before him, and there was none that
  could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became
  great. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I was considering, and,
  behold, a he-goat came from the south-west on the face of the whole earth,
  and touched not the earth: and the goat had a horn between his eyes.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And he came to the ram that had the
  horns, which I had seen standing in front of the Ubal, and he ran at him with
  the violence of his strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I
  saw him coming up close to the ram, and he was furiously enraged against him,
  and he smote the ram, and broke both his horns: and there was no strength in
  the ram to stand before him, but he cast him on the ground, and trampled on
  him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And the he-goat grew exceedingly
  great: and when he was strong, his great horn was broken; and four other
  horns rose up in its place toward the four winds of heaven. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And out of one of them came forth one strong horn,
  and it grew very great toward the south, and toward the host: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> and it magnified itself to the host of heaven;
  and there fell to the earth some of the host of heaven and of the stars, and
  they trampled on them. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And this shall
  be until the chief captain shall have delivered the captivity: and by reason
  of him the sacrifice was disturbed, and he prospered; and the holy place
  shall be made desolate. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And a
  sin-offering was given for the sacrifice, and righteousness was cast down to
  the ground; and it practised, and prospered. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And I heard one saint speaking, and a saint said
  to a certain one speaking, How long shall the vision continue, even the
  removal of the sacrifice, and the bringing in of the sin of desolation; and
  how long shall the sanctuary and host be trampled? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And he said to him, Evening and morning there
  shall be two thousand and four hundred days; and then the sanctuary shall be
  cleansed. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And it came to pass, as I,
  even I Daniel, saw the vision, and sought to understand it, that, behold,
  there stood before me as the appearance of a man. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And I heard the voice of a man between the banks
  of the Ubal; and he called, and said, Gabriel, cause that man to understand
  the vision. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he came and stood
  near where I stood: and when he came, I was struck with awe, and fell upon my
  face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man: for yet the vision is for an
  appointed time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And while he spoke
  with me, I fell upon my face to the earth: and he touched me, and set me on
  my feet. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> And he said, Behold, I make
  thee know the things that shall come to pass at the end of the wrath: for the
  vision is yet for an appointed time. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span>
  The ram which thou sawest that had the horns is the king of the Medes and
  Persians. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> The he-goat is the King of
  the Greeks: and the great horn which was between his eyes, he is the first
  king. <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And as for the one that was
  broken, in whose place there stood up four horns, four kings shall arise out
  of his nation, but not in their own strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And at the latter time of their kingdom, when
  their sins are coming to the full, there shall arise a king bold in
  countenance, and understanding riddles. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And his power shall be great, and he shall
  destroy wonderfully, and prosper, and practise, and shall destroy mighty men,
  and the holy people. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And the yoke of
  his chain shall prosper: there is craft in his hand; and he shall magnify
  himself in his heart, and by craft shall destroy many, and he shall stand up
  for the destruction of many, and shall crush them as eggs in his hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And the vision of the evening and
  morning that was mentioned is true: and do thou seal the vision; for it is
  for many days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And I Daniel fell
  asleep, and was sick: then I arose, and did the king’s business; and I
  wondered at the vision, and there was none that understood it.
  <h3 id="daniel9">9</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the first
  year of Darius the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned
  over the kingdom of the Chaldeans, <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> I
  Daniel understood by books the number of the years which was the word of the
  Lord to the prophet Jeremias, even seventy years for the accomplishment of
  the desolation of Jerusalem. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And I set
  my face toward the Lord God, to seek him diligently by prayer and
  supplications, with fastings and sackcloth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed,
  and said, O Lord, the great and wonderful God, keeping thy covenant and thy
  mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy commandments; we have
  sinned, <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> we have done iniquity, we have
  transgressed, and we have departed and turned aside from thy commandments and
  from thy judgments: <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and we have not
  hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings,
  and our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> To thee, O Lord, belongs
  righteousness, an to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of
  Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are
  near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever thou has
  scattered them, for the sin which they committed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> In thee, O Lord, is our righteousness, and to us
  belongs confusion of faced, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our
  fathers, forasmuch as we have sinned. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span>
  To thee, the Lord our God, belong compassions and forgivenesses, whereas we
  have departed from thee; <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> neither have
  we hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he
  set before us by the hands of his servants the prophets. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> Moreover all Israel have transgressed thy law,
  and have refused to hearken to thy voice; so the curse has come upon us, and
  the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we
  have sinned against him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he has
  confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who
  judged us, by bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under
  the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> As it is written in the law of Moses, all these
  evils have come upon us: yet we have not besought the Lord our God, that we
  might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all thy truth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The Lord also has watched, and
  brought the evils upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his work
  which he has executed, but we have not hearkened to his voice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy
  people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and madest to thyself a
  name, as at this day; we have sinned, we have transgressed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> O Lord, thy mercy is over all: let, I pray thee,
  thy wrath turn away, and thine anger from thy city Jerusalem, even thy holy
  mountain: for we have sinned, and because of our iniquities, and those of our
  fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach among all that are
  round about us. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And now, O lord our
  God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause
  thy face to shine on thy desolate sanctuary, for thine own sake, O Lord.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> Incline thine ear, O my God, and
  hear; open thine eyes and behold our desolation, and that of thy city on
  which thy name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before thee on
  the ground of our righteousness, but on the ground of thy manifold
  compassions, O Lord. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Hearken, O Lord;
  be propitious, O Lord; attend, O Lord; delay not, O my God, for thine own
  sake: for thy name is called upon thy city and upon thy people. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and
  confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and bringing my pitiful
  case before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain; <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> yea, while I was yet speaking in prayer, behold
  the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came flying,
  and he touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And he instructed me, and spoke with me, and
  said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to impart to thee understanding.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> At the beginning of thy supplication
  the word came forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art a man much
  beloved: therefore consider the matter, understand the vision. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Seventy weeks have been determined upon thy
  people, and upon the holy city, for sin to be ended, and to seal up
  transgressions, and to blot out the iniquities, and to make atonement for
  iniquities, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision
  and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And thou shalt know and understand, that from the
  going forth of the command for the answer and for the building of Jerusalem
  until Christ the prince there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks; and
  then the time shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and
  the times shall be exhausted. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> And
  after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is
  no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the
  prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of
  the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint the city to desolations.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And one week shall establish the
  covenant with many: and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and
  drink-offering shall be taken away: and on the temple shall be the
  abomination of desolations; and at the end of time an end shall be put to the
  desolation.
  <h3 id="daniel10">10</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the third
  year of Cyrus king of the Persians a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name
  was called Baltasar; and the thing was true, and great power and
  understanding in the vision was given to him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> In those days I Daniel was mourning three full
  weeks. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I ate no pleasant bread, and no
  flesh or wine entered into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself with oil,
  until three whole weeks were accomplished. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was
  near the great river, which is Tigris Eddekel. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold
  a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girt with gold of Ophaz:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> and his body was as Tharsis, and his
  face was a the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
  his arms and his legs as the appearance of shining brass, and the voice of
  his words as the voice of a multitude. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span>
  And I Daniel only saw the vision: and the men that were with me saw not the
  vision; but a great amazement fell upon them, and they fled in fear.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> So I was left alone, and saw this
  great vision, and there was no strength left in me, and my glory was turned
  into corruption, and I retained no strength. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I
  heard him I was pricked in the heart, and I fell with my face to the earth.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And, behold, a hand touched me, and
  it raised me on my knees. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And he said
  to me, O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak to
  thee, and stand upright: for I am now sent to thee. And when he had spoken to
  me this word, I stood trembling. <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And
  he said to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set
  thine heart to understand, and to afflict thyself before the Lord thy God,
  they words were heard, and I am come because of thy words. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians
  withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the princes, came
  to help me; and I left him there with the chief of the kingdom of the
  Persians: <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> and I have come to inform
  thee of all that shall befall thy people in the last days: for the vision is
  yet for many days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And when he had
  spoken with me according to these words, I turned my face to the ground, and
  was pricked in the heart. <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And,
  behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened
  my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, at the
  sight of thee my bowels were turned within me, and I had no strength.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And how shall thy servant be able, O
  my lord, to speak with this my lord? and as for me, from henceforth strength
  will not remain in me, and there is no breath left in me. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And there touched me again as it were the
  appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> and said to me, Fear not, man greatly beloved:
  peace be to thee, quit thyself like a man, and be strong. And when he had
  spoken with me, I received strength, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou
  hast strengthened me <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And he said,
  Knowest thou, wherefore I am come to thee? and now I will return to fight
  with the prince of the Persians: and I was going in, and the prince of the
  Greeks came. <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> But I will tell thee
  that which is ordained in the scripture of truth: and there is no one that
  holds with me in these matters but Michael your prince.
  <h3 id="daniel11">11</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And I in the
  first year of Cyrus stood to strengthen and confirm him. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And now I will tell thee the truth. Behold, there
  shall yet rise up three kings in Persia: and the fourth shall be very far
  richer than all: and after that he is master of his wealth, he shall rise up
  against all the kingdoms of the Greeks. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> An there shall rise up a mighty king, and he shall
  be lord of a great empire, and shall do according to his will. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And when his kingdom shall stand up, it shall be
  broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of heaven; but not to his
  posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled over: for his kingdom
  shall be plucked up, and given to others beside these. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And the king of the south shall be strong; and one
  of their princes shall prevail against him, and shall obtain a great
  dominion. <span style="color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And after his years they
  shall associate; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the
  king of the north, to make agreements with him: but she shall not retain
  power of arm; neither shall his seed stand: and she shall be delivered up,
  and they that brought her, and the maiden, and he that strengthened her in
  these times. <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> But out of the flower of
  her root there shall arise one on his place, and shall come against the host,
  and shall enter into the strongholds of the king of the north, and shall
  fight against them, and prevail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> Yea,
  he shall carry with a body of captives into Egypt their gods with their
  molten images, and all their precious vessels of silver and gold; and he
  shall last longer than the king of the north. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of
  the south, and shall return to his own land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(10)</span> And his sons shall gather a multitude among many:
  and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through, and he shall
  rest, and collect his strength. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And
  the king of the south shall be greatly enraged, and shall come forth, and
  shall war with the king of the north: and he shall raise a great multitude;
  but the multitude shall be delivered into his hand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And he shall take the multitude, and his heart
  shall be exalted; and he shall cast down many thousands; but he shall not
  prevail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(13)</span> For the king of the north
  shall return, and bring a multitude greater than the former, and at the end
  of the times of years an invading army shall come with a great force, and
  with much substance. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> And in those
  times many shall rise up against the king of the south; and the children of
  the spoilers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision;
  and they shall fail. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> And the king of
  the north shall come in, and cast up a mound, and take strong cities: and the
  arms of the king of the south shall withstand, and his chosen ones shall rise
  up, but there shall be no strength to stand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(16)</span> And he that comes in against him shall do
  according to his will, and there is no one to stand before him: and he shall
  stand in the land of beauty, and it shall be consumed by his hand.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And he shall set his face to come in
  with the force of his whole kingdom, and shall cause everything to prosper
  with him: and he shall give him the daughter of women to corrupt her: but she
  shall not continue, neither be on his side. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And he shall turn his face to the islands, and
  shall take many, and cause princes to cease from their reproach: nevertheless
  his own reproach shall return to him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(19)</span>
  Then he shall turn back his face to the strength of his own land: but he
  shall become weak, and fall, and not be found. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And there shall arise out of his root one that
  shall cause a plant of the kingdom to pass over his place, earning kingly
  glory: and yet in those days shall he be broken, yet not openly, nor in war.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> One shall stand on his place, who has
  been set a nought, and they have not put upon him the honour of the kingdom:
  but he shall come in prosperously, and obtain the kingdom by deceitful ways.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(22)</span> And the arms of him that overflows
  shall be washed away as with a flood from before him, and shall be broken,
  and so shall be the head of the covenant. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And because of the leagues made with him he shall
  work deceit: and he shall come up, and overpower them with a small nation.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And he shall enter with prosperity,
  and that into fertile districts; and he shall do what his fathers and his
  fathers’ fathers have not done; he shall scatter among them plunder, and
  spoils, and wealth; and he shall devise plans against Egypt, even for a time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> And his strength and his heart shall
  be stirred up against the king of the south with a great force; and the king
  of the south shall engage in war with a great and very strong force; but his
  forces shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him: <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> and they shall eat his provisions, and shall
  crush him, and he shall carry away armies as with a flood, and many shall
  fall down slain. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> And as for both the
  kings, their hearts are set upon mischief, and they shall speak lies at one
  table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end is for a fixed time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(28)</span> And he shall return to his land with
  much substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he
  shall perform great deeds, and return to his own land. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(29)</span> At the set time he shall return, and shall come
  into the south, but the last expedition shall not be as the first.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> For the Citians issuing forth shall
  come against him, and he shall be brought low, and shall return, and shall be
  incensed against the holy covenant: and he shall do thus, and shall return,
  and have intelligence with them that have forsaken the holy covenant.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> And seeds shall spring up out of him,
  and they shall profane the sanctuary of strength, and they shall remove the
  perpetual sacrifice, and make the abomination desolate. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And the transgressors shall bring about a
  covenant by deceitful ways: but a people knowing their God shall prevail, and
  do valiantly. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> And the intelligent of
  the people shall understand much: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by
  flame, and by captivity, and by spoil of many days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(34)</span> And when they are weak they shall be helped with
  a little help: but many shall attach themselves to them with treachery.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And some of them that understand
  shall fall, to try them as with fire, and to test them, and that they may be
  manifested at the time of the end, for the matter is yet for a set time.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> And he shall do according to his
  will, and the king shall exalt and magnify himself against every god, and
  shall speak great swelling words, and shall prosper until the indignation
  shall be accomplished: for it is coming to an end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And he shall not regard any gods of his fathers,
  nor the desire of women, neither shall he regard any deity: for he shall
  magnify himself above all. <span style="color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And he
  shall honour the god of forces on his place: and a god whom his fathers knew
  not he shall honour with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and desirable
  things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(39)</span> And he shall do thus in the
  strong places of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase his glory: and
  he shall subject many to them, and shall distribute the land in gifts.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(40)</span> And at the end of the time he shall
  conflict with the king of the south: and the king of the north shall come
  against him with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and they
  shall enter into the land: and he shall break in pieces, and pass on:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> and he shall enter into the land of
  beauty, and many shall fail: but these shall escape out of his hand, Edom,
  and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he shall stretch forth his hand over the
  land; and the land of Egypt shall not escape. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(43)</span> And he shall have the mastery over the secret
  treasures of gold and silver, and over all the desirable possessions of
  Egypt, and of the Libyans and Ethiopians in their strongholds. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(44)</span> But rumors and anxieties out of the east and from
  the north shall trouble him; and he shall come with great wrath to destroy
  many. <span style="color:#b00e23">(45)</span> And he shall pitch the
  tabernacle of his palace between the seas in the holy mountain of beauty: but
  he shall come to his portion, and there is none to deliver him.
  <h3 id="daniel12">12</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And at that
  time Michael the great prince shall stand up, that stands over the children
  of thy people: and there shall be a time of tribulation, such tribulation as
  has not been from the time that there was a nation on the earth until that
  time: at that time thy people shall be delivered, even every one that is
  written in the book. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And many of them
  that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life,
  and some to reproach and everlasting shame. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> And the wise shall shine as the brightness of the
  firmament, and some of the many righteous as the stars for ever and ever.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span> And thou, Daniel, close the words, and
  seal the book to the time of the end; until many are taught, and knowledge is
  increased. <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> And I Daniel saw, and,
  behold, two others stood, on one side of the bank of the river, and the other
  on the other side of the bank of the river. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was
  over the water of the river, When will be the end of the wonders which thou
  has mentioned <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> And I heard the man
  clothed in linen, who was over the water of the river, and he lifted up his
  right hand and his left hand to heaven, and sware by him that lives for ever,
  that it should be for a time of times and half a time: when the dispersion is
  ended they shall know all these things. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I heard, but I understood not: and I said, O
  Lord, what will be the end of these things? <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(9)</span> And he said, Go, Daniel: for the words are closed
  and sealed up to the time of the end. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span>
  Many must be tested, and thoroughly whitened, and tried with fire, and
  sanctified; but the transgressors shall transgress: and none of the
  transgressors shall understand; but the wise shall understand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(11)</span> And from the time of the removal of the perpetual
  sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up, there shall be
  a thousand two hundred and ninety days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the
  thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> But go thou, and rest; for there are yet days and
  seasons to the fulfillment of the end; and thou shalt stand in thy lot at the
  end of the days.
  <h3 id="danielC">C</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> And king
  Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his
  kingdom. <span style="color:#b00e23">(2)</span> And Daniel conversed with the
  king, and was honoured above all his friends. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(3)</span> Now the Babylonians had an idol, called Bel, and
  there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and
  forty sheep, and six vessels of wine. <span style="color:#b00e23">(4)</span>
  And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped
  his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel?
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(5)</span> Who answered and said, Because I may
  not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who hath created the
  heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not
  that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh
  every day? <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> Then Daniel smiled, and
  said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass
  without, and did never eat or drink any thing. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(8)</span> So the king was wroth, and called for his priests,
  and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these
  expenses, ye shall die. <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> But if ye can
  certify me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken
  blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according to
  thy word. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> Now the priests of Bel were
  threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with
  Daniel into the temple of Bel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> So
  Bel's priests said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and
  make ready the wine, and shut the door fast and seal it with thine own
  signet; <span style="color:#b00e23">(12)</span> And to morrow when thou
  comest in, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer
  death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> And they little regarded it: for under the table
  they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and
  consumed those things. <span style="color:#b00e23">(14)</span> So when they
  were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his
  servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in
  the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and
  sealed it with the king's signet, and so departed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(15)</span> Now in the night came the priests with their
  wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> In the morning betime the king arose,
  and Daniel with him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> And the king
  said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> And as soon as he had opened the
  dour, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art
  thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he
  should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose
  footsteps are these. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> And the king
  said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was
  angry, <span style="color:#b00e23">(21)</span> And took the priests with
  their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in,
  and consumed such things as were upon the table. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel
  into Daniel's power, who destroyed him and his temple. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(23)</span> And in that same place there was a great dragon,
  which they of Babylon worshipped. <span style="color:#b00e23">(24)</span> And
  the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he
  liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god:
  therefore worship him. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then said
  Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living
  God. <span style="color:#b00e23">(26)</span> But give me leave, O king, and I
  shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give thee
  leave. <span style="color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then Daniel took pitch, and
  fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he
  put in the dragon's mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder: and Daniel
  said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> When they of Babylon heard that, they took great
  indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a
  Jew, and he hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain the dragon, and put the priests
  to death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(29)</span> So they came to the king,
  and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine house.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(30)</span> Now when the king saw that they
  pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them:
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(31)</span> Who cast him into the lions' den:
  where he was six days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(32)</span> And in the den
  there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and
  two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour
  Daniel. <span style="color:#b00e23">(33)</span> Now there was in Jewry a
  prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a
  bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(34)</span> But the angel of the Lord said unto
  Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who
  is in the lions' den. <span style="color:#b00e23">(35)</span> And Habbacuc
  said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(36)</span> Then the angel of the Lord took him
  by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency
  of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(37)</span> And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel,
  take the dinner which God hath sent thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(38)</span> And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God:
  neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(39)</span> So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of
  the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again immediately. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(40)</span> Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail
  Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was
  sitting. <span style="color:#b00e23">(41)</span> Then cried the king with a
  loud voice, saying, Great art Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other
  beside thee. <span style="color:#b00e23">(42)</span> And he drew him out, and
  cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were
  devoured in a moment before his face.
  <h3 id="danielD">D</h3><span style="color:#b00e23">(1)</span> In the third
  year of Cyrus the Persian, who captured Babylon, a word was revealed to
  Daniel, whose name is Balthasar. This word is true. I, Daniel, fasted for
  twenty one days until the evening; I had not eaten meat, I had not drunk
  wine, I had not anointed myself with oil. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(2)</span> It happened, as I was on the bank of the Tigris,
  that this was revealed to me; I looked; and the four winds of heaven were
  blowing towards the great sea. <span style="color:#b00e23">(3)</span> I saw
  four very frightening animals rising from the river. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(4)</span> The first animal resembled a bear, having wings
  like an eagle. I saw as I waited that it flew with its wings; a human heart
  was given to it and it stood on its feet. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(5)</span> The second animal resembled human flesh;
  excessively horrible, it stood to one side. I watched until three quarters of
  its face were broken and the fourth quarter remained firm. I looked at it
  until its teeth were torn out of its mouth. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(6)</span> The third animal resembled a panther; it had
  wings, four heads, devouring with speed and scattering what remained.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(7)</span> The fourth animal which I saw
  resembled a lion, an animal much more terrible than all the animals which had
  been before it. Power and great force were given to it; its hands were of
  iron, its nails of bronze; devouring, chewing, crushing with its feet what
  remained. I saw ten horns which came out from its head: I saw also another
  small horn, which came out beside these ten horns. And great power and a
  remarkable form were given to it. I saw four different (horns) which arose on
  its left, then four others which arose after all these; each of them was
  different from the others, and, between them all, they made nineteen (horns).
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(8)</span> And I heard a voice which said to me:
  "Daniel, do you understand what you saw?" But I said: "How can I understand,
  if nobody guides me?" <span style="color:#b00e23">(9)</span> I looked and I
  saw an angel of God standing on my right. Its wings were extremely bright. I
  was afraid and I fell to the ground. The angel seized me, made me stand on my
  feet and said to me: "Stand on your feet, so that I can proclaim to you what
  will happen in the last days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(10)</span> The
  four animals which you saw are four kingdoms. The animal that you saw,
  similar to a bear, is the king of Persia. He will possess the land for five
  hundred fifty-five (555) years. Then he will perish with his kingdom; he will
  not be powerful for always. <span style="color:#b00e23">(11)</span> The
  second animal that you saw, similar to human flesh, it is the king of the
  Romans: he will seize the land as if by iron; he will extend himself over it;
  he will dominate by his armies as far as the land of the Ethiopians, and he
  will reign over it nine hundred and eleven years. But he will not possess the
  capital of the kingdom, until many days are completed. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(12)</span> The third animal which you saw, who resembled a
  panther, it is the king of the Greeks. He will reign over it for a thousand
  years and thirty days; but his reign will not last. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(13)</span> The fourth animal which you saw, who resembles a
  lion, is the king of the sons of Ishmael. He will reign for a long time over
  the land and will be very powerful during many days. This realm will be of
  the race of Abraham and of the slave of Sara, the wife of Abraham. All the
  cities of the Persians, the Romans and the Greeks will be destroyed; nineteen
  kings of this race among the sons of Ishmael will reign over the land; they
  will reign until the time of their end. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(14)</span> The tenth of their kings will be like a prophet,
  the number of his name is 399. He will practise justice, will give bread to
  the famished, clothing to those which are naked. He will free those who are
  slaves. His mercy will spread over the whole land, and his justice up to
  heaven. <span style="color:#b00e23">(15)</span> The eleventh of their kings
  will practise iniquity over all the land; he will ruin the old works. He will
  persecute those which are on the land, so that nobody is found who lives
  there or remains there. All men will groan for forty-two months. If the God
  of heaven treats him with indulgence, his reign will last forty months.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(16)</span> The reign of the twelfth of their
  kings will consequently be strengthened by the judgements of his mouth. He
  will carry out malicious actions in the land, so much that men will be
  astonished by what he did. There will be many wars during his reign. At the
  end of the time, a king will thoroughly disturb the kingdom of Ismaelites for
  one hundred and forty-seven years. In the hundred and tenth year of his
  reign, he will have a war with the Ethiopians. The Ismaelites will reign over
  them, until they have despoiled the city of the kingdom, which is Souban.
  They will send messengers to ask for peace; they will give them money and
  gold in great quantity, a tribute will be paid to them in Ethiopia.
  <span style="color:#b00e23">(17)</span> The thirteenth of them will not live
  in this kingdom at all, and they will not fear him. His reign will be of a
  few days. <span style="color:#b00e23">(18)</span> The fourteenth of their
  kings will receive gold and money in great quantity and he will judge the
  land with equity. He will engage in war with Lower Egypt, so that Egypt is in
  sorrow and groaning. The Ethiopians will not be subjected at all to him, they
  will not pay him tribute. In those days there will be war in the land of the
  Romans. The Ethiopians will make war with the southernmost regions of Egypt;
  they will plunder the boroughs and all the cities of lower Egypt, until they
  arrive at the town of Cleopatra that she built herself in Upper Egypt, which
  city is Schmoun. After these things, the king of Syria will learn of it, he
  will fear the end because the war is approaching him. In the end, his reign
  will be established and he will enjoy a happy existence. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(19)</span> Then a child will arise among the Israelites will
  rise; this is the fifteenth of their kings. In his heart, he will be hard
  like iron; he will extend his sword to the Romans; his right hand will be on
  the Ethiopians. His face will be double (=cheating) and his language will be
  double (=crafty). During the days of his reign, there will be a great
  disorder over all the land, and his word will be violent like fire. The
  Ethiopians will bring gifts of gold to him, of silver, of pearls, and he will
  impose his work on everyone. He will make several nations captive in order to
  conscript them; throughout all his reign, there will not be enough bread;
  there will be no peace as long as he will reign, and in his time carnage will
  be frequent. <span style="color:#b00e23">(20)</span> As for the sixteenth of
  their kings, there will be no war in his kingdom, and he himself will not
  fight with anybody, and he will be granted a long time (which he will spend)
  in peace, and his reign will pass in uprightness. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(21)</span> As regards the seventeenth of their kings, a war
  will break out between him and his nation; it is him whose name makes the
  number 666. He will elevate from his nation a man who will make war for him;
  he will pursue him as far as Egypt with the riches of its kingdom. He will
  neglect his nation and its great people and will scatter riches in public
  places and highways. While moving in lower Egypt with his riches, he will go
  into Upper Egypt on the side of the North, with the intention to plunder
  Souban, the city of the Ethiopians, with the remainder of its riches. But a
  man of his own nation will kill him in the southernmost regions of lower
  Egypt, and will take what remains to him of his riches. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(22)</span> The eighteenth of their kings, at the beginning
  of his reign, will work great evils, for one thousand, two hundred and sixty
  days. He will wage war in the western countries, and he will gain the victory
  until the day of his death. <span style="color:#b00e23">(23)</span> Then
  among them a child will arise, who is his son. This one is the nineteenth of
  their kings. He will be the child of a double race, because his father is an
  Israelite, his mother is Roman. There will be war in Egypt and Syria for
  twenty one months. Their swords will fall on themselves in this war. This is
  the king whose name makes the number 666; he will be called by these three
  names: Mametios, Khalle and Sarapidos. Being a child, he will reign in order
  to do much evil. He will order all the Jews which are in all places to gather
  in Jerusalem. All the land will be disturbed during his reign, until any man
  can be sold for a single dinar. He is without decency and he will forget the
  fear of God. He will not remember the law of Ishmael his father, nor of his
  mother, who is Roman; he will be arrogant, continuously drunk; he will make a
  great number of those who eat at his table die by poisoned beverages, and in
  these days there will be great devastations. He will free Syria and the
  territory of Jews, and will torment the East and Egypt. He will establish
  carriers of letters in Egypt. Two and three times in only one year, the East
  will be against itself in this reign which will be the nineteeth. He will
  seek neither justice, nor truth, but he will seek gold all the time. He will
  establish managers in the regions of Africa, and a great quantity of
  soldiers. War will break out between him and them; they will destroy the
  multitude which is with him; he will be established in the regions of Africa,
  with what will remain of his troops, for several years, and he will not
  overcome it (Africa). Then a foreign nation will rise against him; it is
  called Pitourgos (the Turk); it will make war on him. Sarapidos will dominate
  over many Romans, over Pentapolis, over the Medes; from them all he will take
  a tribute, will command their cities and will plunder the city which he
  built, and regions that his father had gathered. The Turk will prepare for
  war to remove the kingdom from the hands of Sarapidos; hitherto Sarapidos
  remained at home. He was looking for spoils, because Sarapidos had great
  riches before his eyes, gold, silver, all kinds of precious stones, and
  desirable utensils of every kind. But it will be proclaimed to him that the
  Turk has made himself Master of all Syria and his borders, and he will go out
  in great disorder with all his troops; he will leave all the water-skins,
  will not carry anything with him; but he will have a heart of an animal,
  reflecting and knowing not what to do. Then, when he flees, going up Egypt,
  the Turk will precede him with his troops. They will both land with their
  troops, they will fight until blood runs in floods. The Turk is of Roman
  race. There will be war at Eschmoun the city, until the water of the river is
  changed into blood because of the great quantity of those wounded to death.
  No-one will be able to drink the water any more. Many men will die by the
  sword, uncountable. Those who remain will plunder their own country from
  where they left. The Turk will make Sarapidos perish, in order to remove his
  kingdom from him, for fear he will not obtain the kingdom of the Ishmaelites;
  but this is here the end of their number. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(24)</span> Then the king of the Romans will rise up against
  them, he will destroy them by the edge of the sword in the middle of the
  Ishmaelites in the territory of their fathers in the desert. The Ishmaelites
  will be governed always by the Romans; the Romans will dominate over Egypt
  for forty years. <span style="color:#b00e23">(25)</span> Then two nations
  will rise, by the name of Gog and Magog; they will shake the ground for
  several days; their number is as great as the grains of sand. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(26)</span> Then Antichrist will appear who will deceive many
  of them. When he is strengthened, he will seduce even the elect. He will kill
  the two prophets Enoch and Elias, so that for three and a half days they will
  be dead in the public places of the great town of Jerusalem. <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(27)</span> Then the Ancient of Days will bring them back to
  life. It is He whom I see coming with the clouds from Heaven, similar to a
  son of man. His power is an eternal power and His reign will have no end. It
  is he which will put Antichrist to death and all the multitude which is with
  him. There will be misfortune then in truth to any soul who will live in that
  time over all the land, because there will be iniquity, a great affliction
  and groanings; but the salvation of man is between the hands of God in
  Heaven. This is the end of the speech." <span style=
  "color:#b00e23">(28)</span> The angel said to me: "Daniel, Daniel, conceal
  these discourses, seal them up until the time when they will be fulfilled,
  because that is the end of all." I, Daniel, I arose, I put a seal to the
  discourse, and sealed them. I will glorify God, the father of all things and
  the lord of the universe, He who knows the dates and times. To him be glory
  and power forever. Amen.
